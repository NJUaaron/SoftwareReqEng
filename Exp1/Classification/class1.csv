3,vim - Why should I use an IDE? ,"In another question  speaks highly of IDEs saying ""some people still just dont know ""why"" they should use one..."".  As someone who uses vim for programming and works in an environment where most/all of my colleagues use either vim or emacs for all of their work what are the advantages of IDEs?  Why should I use one? I'm sure this is a charged issue for some people and I'm not interested in starting a flame war so .  I'm not interested in hearing about why I shouldn't use an IDE; I already don't use one.  I'm interested in hearing from ""the other side of the fence"" so to speak. If you think that IDEs may be suitable for some types of work but not others I'm also interested to hear why.It really depends on what language you're using but in C# and Java I find IDEs beneficial for: All of these save time. They're things I could do manually but with more pain: I'd rather be coding. Code completion. It helps a lot with exploring code. The short answer as to why I use an IDE is laziness. I'm a lazy soul who doesn't like to do things a difficult way when there is an easy way to do it instead. IDE's make life easy and so appeal to us lazy folk. As I type code the IDE automatically checks the validity of the code I can highlight a method and hit F1 to get help right click and select ""go to to definition"" to jump straight to where it is defined. I hit one button and the application with debugger automatically attached is launched for me. And so the list goes on. All the things that a developer does on a day to day basis is gathered under one roof. There is no need to use an IDE. It is just much harder work not to. I don't think it's fair to do the classic ""text editor and console window vs IDE"" when ""text editor"" is really emacs. Most features that are typical for IDE:s are also in emacs. Or perhaps they even originated there and modern IDE:s are mainly interface improvements/simplifications. This means that for the original question the answer is not so clear-cut. It depends on > power of Vim using something like the  and Emacs fulfil many functions any IDE will give you. The only aspect they do not handle that a larger IDE may are things like UI designers. Then your question boils down to simply ""what IDE should I use"" with arguments to be made for the simpler realm of Vim and Emacs. For me an IDE is better because it allows faster navigation in code which is important if you have something in your mind to implement.Supposed you do not use an IDE it takes longer to get to the destination. Your thoughts may be interupted more often. It means more clicks/more keys have to be pressed.One has to concentrate more on the thought how to implement things.Of course you can write down things too but then one must jump between the design and implementation.Also a GUI designer makes a big difference. If you do that by hand it may take longer. GUI-based IDEs like Visual Studio and Eclipse have several advantages over text-based IDEs like Emacs or vim because of their display capabilities: Basically with a GUI-based IDE you can get more useful information on screen at once and you can view/edit graphical portions of of your application as easily as text portions. One of the coolest things to experience as a developer is editing a method that computes some data and seeing the live output of your code displayed graphically in another window just as your user will see it when you run the app.  Now that's WYSIWYG editing! Text-based IDEs like Emacs and vim can add features like code completion and refactoring over time so in the long run their main limitation is their text-based display model. I also almost exclusively use Vim (almost because I'm trying to learn emacs now) for all my development stuff. I think sheer intuitiveness (from the GUI of course) is the primary reason why people like to use IDEs. By being intuitive little to no learning overhead of the tool is required. The lesser the learning overhead the more they can get work done. An  allows one to work faster and more easily... I noticed I spent a lot of time navigating in the code in a simple text editor... In a good IDE that time goes down if the IDE supports jumping to functions to previous editing positionto variables... Also a good IDE reduces the time to experiment with different language features and projects as the start-up time can be small. A couple of reasons I can think of for using an IDE: And quite frankly I like my mouse. When I use pure text-based editors it gets lonely. Saves time to developMakes life easier by providing features like Integrated debugging intellisense. There are lot many but will recommend to use one they are more than obvious. I'm not sure there's a clear dividing line between a text editor and an IDE. You have the likes of Notepad at one end of the scale and the best modern IDEs at the other but there are a lot of thing in between. Most text editors have syntax highlighting; editors aimed at programmers often have various other features such as easy code navigation and auto complete. Emacs even lets you integrate a debugger. The IDEs of even ten years ago had far less features to help programmers than you'd expect of a serious text editor these days. My main  reason to use one is when the code goes beyond 100 files. Although ctags can do the work  have a pretty good way to navigate the files easily an super fast. It saves time when you have a lot of work to do. To me it's just the the GUI version of everything we did in the good old days of the terminal. I will always agree that IDE are not very superior because they hide a lot of stuff especially concerning the linking stuff but they have a notable advantage in some cases for example with certain development platforms like Qt. Some IDE like visual of others even seem to parse your code as you type it and detect errors before you even compile: it seems logics that only an IDE can work closely with a compiler to immediately detect problem in the typed source. My wild answer that the IDE/Command-line flame war exists is just because the C/C++ executable building is not very well handled from a standardized point of view unlike with the D language; every platform handles compiling/linking/etc its own way so to make it less messy they make an IDE. From your viewpoint it might be more simple to use the command-line if there would have been only one compiler with standard options it would have been easy but the truth is C/C++ is flexible so in the end all platform do it their own way hence the IDE to not waste explaining how to do it. If you can learn how an executable talks to the kernel or if you know anything about compiler design maybe there is a way to work with a proper command-line but I doubt you have. Microsoft or Apple all evil they would be have to propose a straight-forward way to build application without entering in the details and since building an application depends directly on the architecture of the OS it will hardly be ""standard"" as the command-line is. To put it simple big and complex applications where you don't want to dig too deep into what it does -&gt; IDE little pieces of software or simple system software-design -&gt; command-line. Except of course those nifty libraries that embed a Makefile but that's another story. Also I think IDE are used when the application delivered has something to do with ironically a GUI or something that has an interface or is directly bound to an OS so again it's also for people who will use a UI/GUI without knowing how it works while people who will program systems won't need it all. IDE is just modern shit but I think in 100 years the command-line will still exist. I like an IDE because it puts a lot of functionality at my fingertips.  Editing/Compilation/visibility of files in the project are all things I value in an IDE.  I use Visual Studio now but in a former life I used SlickEdit and found that it made my development process more streamlined than when I wasn't using it. There's only one thing to consider when deciding whether to use an IDE or not and that's whether it makes you more productive or not. Short question so short answer :) It depends highly on what you're doing and what language you're doing it in.  Personally I tend to not use an IDE (or ""my IDE consists of 3 xterms running vim one running a database client and one with a bash prompt or tailing logs"" depending on how broadly you define ""IDE"") for most of my work but if I were to find myself developing a platform-native GUI then I'd reach for a language-appropriate IDE in an instant - IMO IDEs and graphical form editing are clearly made for each other."

I could find these SO topics: I'm not looking for a > The minimums are fairly standard: syntax highlighting code completion (like  or its Eclipse counterpart) and integrated debugging (e.g. basicbreakpoints).

I know that  and I really like that IDE for Java but is it any good for C++ and is there something better? The second post actually has some good suggestions but what I am missing is what exactly makes the sugested IDE so good for the user what are its (dis)advantages? Maybe my question should therefore be: >When originally writing this answer I had recently made the switch from Visual Studio (with years of experience) to Linux and the first thing I did was try to find a reasonable IDE. At the time this was impossible: no good IDE existed. And then I realised that the IDE in Linux is the command line with its tools: Depending on your needs you will then have to install and configure several plugins to make the editor work nicely (that’s the one annoying part). For example most programmers on Vim will benefit from the  The decision to use CodeLite was based on a research regarding the following C++ IDE for Linux: After all I have decided to use >You must definitely check out  is an excellent IDE. It supports large code-bases well without slowing down or spending all its time indexing. (This is a problem I had with eclipse's cdt).  Slickedit's speed is probably the nicest thing about it actually.The code completion works well and there are a large amount of options for things like automatic formatting beautification and refactoring.It does have integrated debugging.It has plug-in support and fairly active community creating them.In theory you should be able to integrate well with people doing the traditional makefile stuff as it allows you to create a project directly from one but that didn't work as smoothly as I would have liked when I tried it.In addition to Linux there are Mac and Windows versions of it should you need them.It's been a month since I started using Vim as my main 'GUI'tool for programming C++ in Linux. At first the learningcurve was indeed a bit steep but after a while and with theright options turned on and  I reallygot the hang of it!

I'm also > closing this question so people can stillreact or maybe even add new suggestions or additions to thealready really nice answers... I recommend you read :   If you like Eclipse for Java I suggest Eclipse CDT. Despite C/C++ support isn't so powerful as is for Java it still offers most of the features. It has a nice feature named Managed Project that makes working with C/C++ projects easier if you don't have experience with Makefiles. But you can still use Makefiles.I do C and Java coding and I'm really happy with CDT. I'm developing the firmware for a embedded device in C and a application in Java that talks to this device and is really nice to  use the same environment for both. I guess it probably makes me more productive. I love how people completely miss the request in the original question for an IDE.  Linux is NOT an IDE.  That's just not what those words mean.  I learned c and c++ using vi and gcc and make and I'm not saying they aren't adequate tools but they are NOT an IDE.  Even if you use more elaborate tools like vim or emacs or whatever fancy editor you want typing commands on a command line is not an IDE. Also you all know make exists as part of visual studio right?  The idea that an IDE is ""limiting"" is just silly if you can use the IDE to speed some things yet are still able to fall back on command line stuff when needed. All that said I'd suggest as several above have trying Code blocks.  Its got decent code highlighting a pretty effortless way to create a project code it run it etc that is the core of a real IDE and seems fairly stable.  Debugging sucks...I have never seen a decent interactive debugger in any linux/unix variant.  gdb ain't it.  If you're used to visual studio style debugging you're pretty much out of luck. Anyway I'll go pack my things I know the one-view-only linux crowd will shout this down and run me out of town in no time. make + vim + gdb = one great IDE I quite like  for Eclipse could fill your needs? The Linux Tools project aims to bring a full-featured C and C++ IDE to Linux developers. We build on the source editing and debugging features of the CDT and integrate popular native development tools such as the GNU Autotools Valgrind OProfile RPM SystemTap GCov GProf LTTng etc. Current projects include LTTng trace viewers and analyzers an RPM .spec editor Autotools build integration a Valgrind heap usage analysis tool and OProfile call profiling tools.

And then I noticed that this simply isn't how you work there* and I threw everything out spent a few days reading manuals set up my shell (bash) set up a GVIM environment learned the GCC/binutils toolchain make and gdb and lived happily ever after. I'd mostly agree but the problem is also one of perception: we forget how difficult it was to become productive in any chose IDE (or other environment).  I find IDE's (Visual Studio NetBeans Eclipse) amazingly cumbersome in so many ways. As an old-time UNIX guy I always use Emacs. But that has a pretty steep   and long learning curve so I'm not sure I can recommend it to newcomers. I'd second that; use Emacs as my primary editor on both Linux and on MSW (XP2W2K).I would disagree that it has a > delays many seconds before refreshing files from disk.

14,eclipse - What is the best IDE to develop Android apps in? ,I am about to start developing an android app and need to get an IDE. Eclipse and the android eclipse plugin appears to be the natural choice. However I am familiar with intelliJ and re-sharper so I would prefer use intelliJ.  Has anyone used ? Is this any good? Should I just bite the bullet and learn Eclipse? IntelliJ now has support for Android. See  is the best option for android. i have used both eclipse and intellij and found intellij is much easier to use with android as compared to eclipse because of these reasons :- Intellij provides a built-in support for android and you don't have to configure it as you need to do with eclipse.Intellij gives you auto-lookup feature which is really important for developer like us to increase our productivity. And if we talk about eclipse you have to type each and every method classname etc on your own. (May be eclipse has this feature too but i never found it and trust me i tried to find it like anything)Its much more user friendly and easy to use than eclipse.I hope it will help you and other members of stack overflow to decide which IDE is best for Android development. My personal choice is Intellij. - visual editor. IDEA has one as well but it's rather primitive. I suspect that this feature will soon be deleted as IDEA will improve its editor.- many projects into one right pane (this is also my personal con as I like IDEA's one-project-per-pane thing)- faster compiles Android projects. IDEA has made its compilation process faster so I also soon expect to delete this Eclipse pro - faster intellisense (if you like Resharper then you know what I am talking about)- smarter autocomplete - my friend and I decided to write the same class. I finished before him simply because IDEA faster reacts to my wishes- incredibly smart - do not know what to do? just press Ctrl+Shift+Space and IDEA will tell you what should come there. It also recognizes naming scheme to if you're filling  method.- will add more as I remember of them   - Still the only con is that if you open Eclipse Android project and edit any XML layout file Eclipse will no longer be able to display edited file into its visual layout editor. This has not been fixed as of this day and it's IDEA's bug as it somehow messes the XML. Bottom line: if you're a person who does not see advantages of ReSharper in .NET (and we all coded in .NET) then you'll probably stick to Eclipse. It's official Android IDE and you believe it's the best.If you liked ReSharper and want to code faster then you'll appreciate IDEA and will stick to it forever.  An IDE which supports Android development is  - great for anyone familiar with Basic  Eclipse and Netbeans are both horrible slow and I'ts a miracle that even the serious developers has been sticking with it for years not even try to stick with a better product. Java as platform is a shame when it comes to non-handheld platforms (winmaclinux) and if anyone are going to develop on the platform I say do what else but do not use Java at all. For mobility it's probably has a kind of good luck here as the systems are more down-scaled. As far I know there aren't any existing IDE for Java which aren't iself written in a Java environment. This is horrible because Java is messing up the desktop  environment.  I'm willing to spend hours on google to find an Java IDE/Editor which are capable for android projects but will use a native environment for itself. I Feel Eclipse IDE is more suitable for android applications rather than other IDEs.Because its providing us more than five perspectives which will make our project flexible and ease.You may try Eclipse ides starts with 3.6 and above will provide you better performance.  which are all latest and supports all kind of access. I am a huge supporter of using the environment that is most familiar to you. However this isn't always the best option. In some cases a different environment can result in (far?) greater efficency in the long run. In this particular case I suspect that sticking with what you already know is a good option but someone starting new would benifit from the easy setup and sdk/ndk integration offered by eclipse. I also don't know how available geolocation manipulation (or phone state manipulation - ie incoming call etc) is in other IDE's but integration within eclipse feels seamless.  that i worked with that. you can try it.
17,Why is debugging better in an IDE? ,"I've been a software developer for over twenty years programming in C Perl SQL Java  PHP JavaScript and recently Python.  I've never had a problem I could not debug using some careful thought and well-placed debugging  statements? Can you suggest resources (tutorials books screencasts) that show the finer techniques of IDE debugging? Sweet answers!  Thanks much to everyone for taking the time.  Very illuminating.  I voted up many and voted none down.   Some notable points:Some examples of some abilities that an IDE debugger will give you over trace messages in code: In summary print statements are (generally) > toolkit at your fingertips. When I first started coding I couldn't understand what the big deal with debuggers was and I thought I could achieve anything with tracing (granted that was on unix and the debugger was GDB).  But once you learn how to properly use a graphical debugger you don't want to go back to print statements. An IDE debugger lets you change thevalues of variables at run-time.  An IDEdebugger lets you see the value ofvariables you didn't know you wantedto see when execution began.  An IDEdebugger lets you see the call stackand examine the state of thefunction passed weird values. (think this function is called fromhundreds of places you don't knowwhere these weird values are comingfrom)  An IDE debugger lets youconditionally break execution at anypoint in code based on a conditionnot a line number. An IDE debugger will let you examine the state of the program in the case of an unhandled exception instead of just crapping out. Here's one thing that you definitely cannot debug with ""print"" statement which is when a customer brings you memory dump and says ""your program crashed can you tell me why?"" I think debugging using print statements is a lost art and very important for every developer to learn.  Once you know how to do that certain classes of bugs become much easier to debug that way than through an IDE.  Programmers who know this technique also have a really good feel of what's useful information to put in a log message (not to mention you'll actually end up reading the log) for non-debugging purposes as well. That said you really should know how to use the step-through debugger since for a different class of bugs it is WAY easier.  I'll leave it up to the other excellent answers already posted to explain why :) Off the top of my head: As alternative to debug in IDE you can try great Google Chrome extension ) is .NET only so you might want an older one (like in the first link) if you want native code debugging (it covers both .NET and native).  I personally feel the answer is as simple as ""A integrated debugger/IDE gives you a wealth of different information quickly without the need for punching in commands. The information tends to be there in front of you without you haven't tell it what to show you. The > in which the information can be retrieved is what makes them better than just command-line debugging or ""printf"" debugging. Advantages of a debugger over a printf () Can set watchpoints. This is one of my favourite ways of finding memory corruptions Can debug a binary that you can't recompile at the moment Can debug a binary that takes a long time to recompile Can change variables on the fly Can call functions on the fly  Doesn't have the problem where debug statemenets are not flushed and hence timing issue can not be debugged acuratly Debuggers help with core dumps print statements dont' This is what I use most on VS.NET debugging windows: In summary it gives me a 360 degree view of the state of my executing code not just a small window.  Never found a book teaching this kind of stuff but then again it seems to be quite simple it's pretty much WYSIWYG.  A debugger can attach to a running process Often easier to debug threaded code from a debugger With an IDE debugger you can see the values of ALL the variables in the current scope (all  the way up the call stack) whenever you halt execution.  Print statements can be great but dumping so much information to the screen at any given place can produce a >. You just need to define some actions that print required state in each breakpoint start the console debugger with . A problem with using print statements is it makes a mess of your code. IE you have a function with 10 parts to it and you know it crashes somewhere but you're not sure where. So you add in 10 extra print statements to pinpoint where the bug is. Once you've found and solved your bug you now have to clean up by removing all of those print statements. Maybe you'll do that. Maybe you'll forget and it'll end up in production and your user's console will be full of debug prints. Wauw do I like this question. I never dared to pose it... It seems that people just have different ways of working.For me what works best is: I've earned my living programming for over 40 years now working at non-trivial technical and scientific applications in C++ and Python daily and I have the personal experience that a debugger doesn't help me a bit. I don't say that's good. I don't say that's bad. I just want to share it. It's not just debugging.  An IDE helps you build better software faster in a lot of ways: I could go on."
18,macos - C++ IDE for Macs ,I teach a C++ course using Visual Studio.  One of my students has a Mac and was looking for an IDE to use on his machine. What would be good to recommend? library. It's the one I use. Another (albeit non-free) option is to install VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop on the Mac and run Windows with Visual Studio in a VM. This works really pretty well.  The downsides are: The upside is that you and the student don't need to hassle with differences in the IDE that may not be accounted for in your instruction materials. If you are looking for a full-fledged IDE like Visual StudioI think Eclipse might be your best bet. Eclipse is also highly extensible and configurable. See here:  is free and good which is lucky because it's pretty much the only option on the Mac.
19,Tips for using Vim as a Java IDE? ,"I'm addicted to Vim it's now my de facto way of editing text files. Being that it's mainly a text editor and not an IDE has anyone got tricks for me to make it easier when developing Java apps? Some questions I have: Anything else (other than ""Don't do it!"") that I should know about?Some tips: Have fun :-) I've been a Vim user for years.  I'm starting to find myself starting up Eclipse occasionally (using the vi plugin which I have to say has a variety of issues).  The main reason is that Java builds take quite a while...and they are just getting slower and slower with the addition of highly componentized build-frameworks like maven.  So validating your changes tends to take quite a while which for me seems to often lead to stacking up a bunch of compile issues I have to resolve later and filtering through the commit messages takes a while. When I get too big of a queue of compile issues I fire up Eclipse.  It lets me make cake-work of the changes.  It's slow brutal to use and not nearly as nice of an editor as Vim is (I've been using Vim for nearly a decade so it's second nature to me).  I find for precision editing—needing to fix a specific bug needing to refactor some specific bit of logic or something else...I simply can't be as efficient at editing in Eclipse as I can in Vim. Also a tip: This makes ). I have just uploaded  for the development of Java Maven projects. And don't forget to set the highlighting if you haven't already:  EDIT:  Oh an BTW i've tried eclim off and on but the reason I like vim is its lightness.  Executing eclipse even on headless mode is just too much mental lifting for me. EDIT2:  I've been using playframework lately and this will probably work with maven builds too: For compiling you can configure VIM's make to run maven or in mycase run a build script tee that to a file. ""play_compile"" is just a compile script.  It uses SBT so Maven should work just fine here.  Even direct javac will work.  This way you can use VIM""s quickfix buffer (:cnext :clist: cprev etc). For jumping around the classes I use .  Its beautiful. Use it.  Faster than eclipse in jumping around files. For jumping around methods I use tagsearch with exuberant c-tags. Jump into method declarations by using ctrl-].  Go back    usingCtrl-o.  Doesnt work as good as eclipse but it works good enough. I use  is a nice tool for coding with useful snippets (like in TextMate). You can use (or modify) a pre-made package or make your own."
22,java - 'Must Override a Superclass Method' Errors after importing a project into Eclipse ,"Anytime I have to re-import my projects into Eclipse (if I reinstalled Eclipse or changed the location of the projects)  of my overridden methods are not formatted correctly causing the error: The method must override a superclass method It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects - for whatever reason the method argument values are not always populated so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance: will be initially populated like this: The odd thing is if I remove my code and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method it uses the same argument names I already had so I don't really know where the problem is other then it auto-formatting the method for me. This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it .. I would be very happy. Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods which are inside an argument of another method?Eclipse is defaulting to Java 1.5 and you have classes implementing interface methods (which in Java 1.6 can be annotated with . No idea why but this will solve it. This is my second time encounter this problem.first time according the alphazero's recommendation it worked.but in the second time I set to 1.6 it don't work it just like 'CACHE' this error after clean and rebuild. Try to switch off 'Build Automatically' as Rollin_s said -&gt; error still here! So I removed the problem project (already set to 1.6) from Package Explorer and import it again -&gt; it start a rebuild and no error this time Hope this help someone Fixing  must override a super class method error is not difficult You just need to change Java source version to 1.6 because from Java 1.6 @Override annotation can be used along with interface method. In order to change source version to 1.6 follow below steps : In my case this problem happened when I imported a Maven project into Eclipse. To solve this I added the following in : Then in the context menu of the project go to ""Maven -&gt; Update Project ..."" and press OK. That's it. Hope this helps. In my case none the solutions above works. I have to checkout my source code to another folder. From eclipse select File &gt; Switch workSpaces &gt; Other... and then import code to the new workspaces. it works after that.   This happens when your maven project uses different Compiler Compliance level and Eclipse IDE uses different Compiler Compliance level. In order to fix this we need to change the Compiler Compliance level of Maven project to the level IDE uses. 1) To See Java Compiler Compliance level uses in Eclipse IDE  *) Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Compiler Compliance level : 1.8 (or 1.7 1.6  ect)  2) To Change Java Compiler Compliance level of Maven project *) Go to  ""Project"" -&gt;  ""Properties"" -&gt; Select ""Java Compiler"" -&gt; Change the Compiler Compliance level : 1.8 (or 1.7 1.6  ect)  "
24,What Ruby IDE do you prefer? ,I've been using Eclipse with RDT (not RadRails) a lot lately and I'm quite happy with it but I'm wondering if you guys know any decent alternatives. I know NetBeans also supports Ruby these days but I'm not sure what it has to offer over Eclipse. Please list any features you think are brilliant or useful when suggesting an IDE makes it easier to compare. Also I said Ruby not Rails. While Rails support is a plus I prefer things to be none Rails-centric. It should also be available on Linux and optionally Solaris.Have you tried . Once I found Geany (Ubuntu) I switched from TextMate (OSX) and never looked back. Geany is a lean clean speedy IDE that can be used either as a text editor or a light-weight IDE. It supports not only text editing features (syntax highlighting code folding auto-completion auto-closing symbol lists code navigation directory tree multi-tabbed open files etc.) but also normal IDE features such as simple project management compile-build-run within the main window. Unlike TextMate it has a Terminal screen within its own window; you do not have to go back and force between your editor window and terminal window. Unlike TextMate it supports international languages. Unlike TextMate it supports multi-platforms Unlike TextMate it is open-source and free. Geany is now my favorite C/Ruby/XML development tool.   RubyMine is so awesome. Everything just works. I could go on and on. Code completion is fast smooth and accurate. Formatting is instantaneous. Project navigation is easy and without struggle. You can pop open any file with a few keystrokes. You don't even need to keep the project tree open but it's there if you want. You can configure just about any aspect of it to behave exactly how you want. NetBeans Eclipse and RubyMine all have more or less the same set of features. However RubyMine is just so much more cleanly designed and easy to use. There's nothing awkward or clunky about it. There are all these nice little design touches that show how JetBrains really put thought into it instead of just amassing a big pile of features. Incidentally RubyMine can do a lot of the things that Vim can do like select and edit a column of text or split the view into several editing panels with different files in them. 
25,LLVM C++ IDE for Windows ,Is there some C/C++ IDE for Windows which is  (merged from answers):LLVM is supported in  as far as I know. I am the main author of the plug-in so you can ask any questions related to it. The plug-in offers the basic functionality for Clang and llvm-gcc compilation and support Linux and Windows (w/ Cygwin &amp; MiNGW). LLVM tools such as assembler archiver linker and static compiler (llc) are configured and can be customized via UI. The plug-in offers all the benefits that IDE can offer such as easy configuration and building with one action.  The only drawback is that it is not ready yet as it lacks of some of the advanced features that LLVM can offer such as Clang analyze and smart auto-completion. The plug-in is also not tested well and may not work perfectly therefore I hope I can get user feedback via mailing list found from Google code development site (listed below). I wish I had time to develop it further. I only develop it in my spare time which is very limited. I welcome any developers to participate and contribute to the project. Development site: Eclipse marketplace (100% free &amp; open-source):.It can be downloaded s as of 2018 which is crucial for debugging).
33,Which Android IDE is better - Android Studio or Eclipse? ,I'm starting to develop for Android. Which IDE should I use - Android Studio or Eclipse sdk?I would like to know which one is better.Working with Eclipse can be difficult at times probably when debugging and designing layouts Eclipse sometimes get stuck and we have to restart Eclipse from time to time. Also you get problems with emulators.  Android studio was released very recently and this IDE is not yet heavily used by developers. Therefore it may contain certain bugs.  This describes the difference between android android studio and eclipse project structure:  The use of IDE is your personal preference.But personally if I had to choose Eclipse is a widely known trusted and certainly offers more features then Android Studio.Android Studio is a little new right now. May be it's upcoming versions keep up to Eclipse level soon. Both are equally good. With Android Studio you have ADT tools integrated and with eclipse you need to integrate them manually. With Android Studio it feels like a tool designed from the outset with Android development in mind.Go ahead they have same features. From the Android Studio download page: Caution: Android Studio is currently available as an early access preview. Several features are either incomplete or not yet implemented and you may encounter bugs. If you are not comfortable using an unfinished product you may want to instead download (or continue to use) the ADT Bundle (Eclipse with the ADT Plugin). My first choice is  which I just finished. It shows you exactly how to use all the features of Eclipse that are useful for developing Android apps. There's also a brief section on getting set up to develop from the command line and from other IDEs.
40,Best C++ IDE or Editor for Windows ,"What is the best C++ IDE or editor for using on Windows? I use Notepad++ but am missing IntelliSense from Visual Studio.I've found the latest release of NetBeans which includes C/C++ support to be excellent.  a powerful open-source cross platform IDE. It has code completion amongst other features. I will quote myself from this question: Someone already said this before me  but QtCreator is really good for Qt4  development. Not only it has a really good code  completion support. It also knows a  little more about the code and what to  complete then I thought I needed. For  example it knows about slots/signals.  This means that connecting  slots/signals via code is much easier  then before. The code editing is really nice. I  remember that when refactoring code  (a few variables starting with  underscore) it remembered the cursor  position between lines and this made  the refactoring much easier. The code  indentation is smart enough to not get  in my way (KDevelop was configurable  but QtCreator learns how I code. At  least it feels like it does). Then there are the cool key  combinations. Most of the  functionality of the IDE can be  accessed using shortcuts. The  ""control+k"" thingie is a nice thing  which some command line users would  like but I am more GUI oriented. I  don't use it. What I really like is the split  window command. Yes KDevelop3 does  it but not as nice as QtCreator. My  favorite is control+e3 which I use to  display the header and implementations  of my classes. Once again the  navigation here is the best I have  seen (control+eo). It also has a nice SCM integration. I  usually use SVN and quite frankly  it's not as good as I need: no  shortcut to diff the project no diff  to commit the whole project no option  to commit several files. I also don't like the ""total  integration of external tools"". I  still like the external QtAssistant -  control+tab is easier to read large  articles. But.... when you define a  QString s and 3 lines bellow you want  to read the interface of QString you  put your cursor on ""s"" and press F1 -  the assistant comes as a sidebar with  QString's documentation. A huge  advantage. Want to follow a definition? F2 to the  help. F4? Changes  header/implementation (yes eclipse  does this better...). The debugger is good. It's not as good  as VisualStudio but ... it has support  for Qt4 internals (you can see the  value of QString and QList!). I can continue... but IMHO you will  need to give it a second and third  try. It really is a good product. Not  as flexible as Eclipse (hi  ryansstack) but it's a really small  fast and young project. I stopped  developing QDevelop because I really  found what I was looking for. ps: yes I mean stopped developing  QDevelop. I was in the development  team. My response is for Qt4 development only. Be warned. SlickEdit is very cool and does support something like intellisense. At my current company I now use Visual Studio and I've mostly gotten used to it - but there are still some SlickEdit features I miss.  As a complete all-in one package Visual Studio 2008 is the best IDE for C++ development with Windows Visual studio is great but there are few tricks you can enhance it with. SonicFileFinder is one - helps you to search source files by partial match. You can map solution-tree to Alt+1 partial filename search to alt+2 and properties-window to alt+3. These are the three most used windows.  Another great tool that is ofter misunderstood is ctrl+shift+F shortcut for searching file contents. People dont use because it's so slow but my advice is - deal with it. Searching  the whole solution (or even all files in project folder) is only slow the first time you use it. Consequitive searches are as fast as jump-to-definition-feature. I've tried SlickEdit Notepad++ emacs jEdit and Visual Studio. VS wins hands-down for Best Windows IDE.  jEdit is probably the best GUI cross-platform editor/almost-IDE and emacs is probably the best terminal cross-platform editor/almost-IDE. The advantage with using these is that when you jump to a Mac or Linux box you know how they work.  I tried Eclipse but it ran like a no-legged dog it was so slow so I didn't use it much. Maybe tech is better now but eh. With Intellisense code folding edit and continue and a whole host of other features Visual Studio is certainly the best IDE.  However for simple code editing I often use UltraEdit.  It has some great features not found in Visual Studio.  One surprisingly useful feature is being able to select a column in the editor.  You can find and replace within the column (useful for tabs vs. spaces wars...) delete the column etc... How about CodeBlocks i find it so fine with me especially the new 10.05 version. I would recommend . Here's another vote for Visual Studio.  The debugger and Intellisense are definitely it's hallmarks.  While other IDE's offer code-completion I've often found them to be somewhat sluggish in this area for some reason (sluggish being a reference to the speed at which code-completion occurs and offers selections).   Other than VS NetBeans is a good polished IDE and is updated on a very regular cycle. I think it's largely a matter of taste but I would recommend begginers to stick to a pure editor (vi emacs...) instead of a full fledged IDE so they can figure out the whole toolchain that modern IDEs hide. Just for the record my weapon of choice is Emacs. personally i dont like microsoft......I hate to admit that visual studio is the best IDE i ever use.....Netbeans is gud but drasticaly slow....other free IDEs are useless..so people try to stick with VS.... M$ VS2008 is a better IDE for this. The question says specifically IDE so I am guessing thats what you want. In that case the main options are Visual Studio and Eclipse CDT as stated above. Of those I personally prefer Eclipse. However don't necessarily limit yourself to an IDE. I prefer to use vim as my editor and WinDbg as my debugger. For compilation your project will probably dictate this. I currently use NMAke on the command line. Use Visual Studio 2010. You can get the full version free with "
51,testing - Online IDE for Python ,Is there any web-based IDE that I can use to run quick tests? There're a dozen for PHP and some for even Java but I haven't found yet that runs Python. If there's an  that'd be better. ThanksYou might want to give a try at: These aren't full IDEs but there are a lot of options for online python interpreters: I'm trying out  is good too. I'm pretty sure that IDE's are the last kind of programs that will ever go web based because a good IDE needs to be so extremely interactive if it wants to be good. I really don't see a reason for this and others seem to agree because there isn't any.And no an interactive web shell or compiler has nothing to do with an IDE.  
60,Using SBT from Scala IDE ,The path from SBT to Scala-IDE is well described in many places: What is the reverse for this? If I start a new project in Scala-IDE can I just add a build.sbt file and somehow tell Eclipse to use this when running the application? Apologies if this seems obvious to some but I've recently moved from ItelliJ Idea to Scala-IDE and I'm not certain about setting up Scala-IDE to use SBT and my sbt config files.No you cannot do this. The way to do it is as you described. Then whenever you make changes to build.sbt (e.g. new jar dependency) rerun the  command from sbt and refresh the project in Eclipse so that the newly generated files are reloaded. As a seasoned Eclipse user I wondered the same thing. Amazed that no one seemed to be going that direction I decided to roll my own project.  Install plugin create or modify build.sbt and dependencies are fetched project files updated. It works for me I use it every day. But it's not perfect or finished and I'm not putting in a lot of effort in it at the moment. But do feel free to contribute!

67,Is there an online PHP IDE? ,"Is there an IDE for PHP where you can edit the code for your pages online? Real syntax highlighting is minimal. More would be great. I'd like to be able to do development on my site at times other than when I'm at home. even thera are some limits (no Internet nonnections no file manipulations) I have been trying for ages to find a really good online php editor with which a/to learn php and b/convert some old Delphi (!) source files into the 21st century.  After a couple of very disappointing experiences and irritating false starts most notably with phpanywhere (god did I have high hopes on first discovering that one:( ) I eventually stumbled upon ShiftEdit in Chrome webstore. So far I've been able to everything I need and as well as providing a simple but powerful enough set of tools; reliability and a general good approach to user interaction has meant that after a couple of weeks I eventually subscribed although free was good enough for my initial purposes and evaluation.  Take from that what you will but I wholeheartedly recommend it and also love their very quick iterative release process.  I don't know what your websites audience is but generally I think it's a bad idea to edit a live website. Much too easy to accidentally break something or worse  your passwords or other secrets by accident. I run my server from home so this will not be available to everyone but this is basically what I dp: If you have access to Google Chrome editor I think you should try ShiftEdit or SourceKit Apps from the web store. This one is specialized on PHP: click File Manager then select a file and click Code Editor. : I tried using it and it can highlight PHP and HTML (at the same time) and it also has a ""code completion"" feature... I'm not sure if that's what it's called but when you write an opening bracket or quote it writes the closing one after the cursor. The only problems are that the highlighting isn't perfect (it treats escaped quotes as actual quotes) and more importantly it's not free. Etherpad is cool to code collectively but it has no syntax highlighting and is not realy an IDE just a collaborative pad for programmers with versioning and chat features.Still pretty cool but not what youre looking for. We are making exactly this happen at very simple and useful php editor - to edit your scripts on FTP server  The new platform by the ""phpanywhere"" Team. I found it to be working very well. Interesting about it making it special is the Android and Iphone app which actually enables you to really code on the go. Thats an interesting idea.  One could use something like this:  to the syntax highlighting then it's just a matter of code completion for things like functions. That much is relatively simple it gets harder when you get into things like per file (or even included file) variables (for the code completion). And now that you have me thinking... It's to bad that I don't know javascript better.If anyone wants to get together and maybe build this idea into a viable project I'm definitely game. There is also  it allows C# VB Java PHP Ruby C++.  Full disclosure I'm one of the founders."

72,Best C++ IDE for *nix ,"What is the best C++ IDE for a *nix envirnoment? I have heard the C/C++ module of Eclipse is decent as well as Notepad++ but beyond these two I have no real idea. Any thoughts or comments?On Ubuntu some the IDEs that are available in the repositories are: There is also:   And of course everyone's favourite text-based editors: Its true that vim and emacs are very powerful tools but the learning curve is very steep..

It has a basic code-completion feature and is a nice clean [Gnome] interface."". See  [edit]It does have it's own C++ class libs (as Hernan points out) but nothing stops you from using any other class libs like the SDL or you can roll your own.

74,ide - How do I run Python code from Sublime Text 2? ,I want to set up a complete Python IDE in Sublime Text 2. I want to know how to run the Python code from within the editor. Is it done using build system? How do I do it ?Tools -&gt; Build System -&gt; (choose) Python then:  Sublime Text probably can't find the Python Interpreter. When trying to run your program see the log and find the reference to Python in path. The point is that it tries to run python via command line the cmd looks like: If you can't run python from cmd Sublime Text can't too.(Try it yourself in cmd type python in it and run it python commandline should appear) You can either change the Sublime Text build formula or the System :*>for example:    manually: (preferable)Add  at the end of the string.
75,"ide - How do I ""Add Existing Item"" an entire directory structure in Visual Studio? ","I have a free standing set of files not affiliated with any C# project at all that reside in a complicated nested directory structure. I want to add them in that format to a different directory in an ASP.NET web application I am working on; while retaining the same structure. So I copied the folder into the target location of my project and I tried to “add existing  item” only to lose the previous folder hierarchy. Usually I have re-created the directories by hand copied across on a one-to-one basis and then added existing items. There are simply too many directories/items in this case. So how do you add existing directories and files in Visual Studio 2008?Drag the files / folders from Windows Explorer into the Solution Explorer. It will add them all. Note this doesn't work if Visual Studio is in Administrator Mode because Windows Explorer is a User Mode process. Enable > This is what I do: Then everything will be added on your solution from folders to files and files inside those folders. A neat trick I discovered is that if you go to ""Add existing..."" you can drag the folder from the open dialog to your solution. I have my Visual Studio to open in Admin Mode automatically so this was a good workaround for me as I didn't want to have to undo that just to get this to work. There is now an open-source extension in the Marketplace that seems to do what the OP was asking for:  If it doesn't do exactly what you want the code is available so you can modify it to suit your scenario. HTH What worked for me was to drag the folder into Visual Studio then right click the folder and select ""Open Folder in File Explorer"". Then select all and drag them into the folder in Visual Studio. In Windows 7 you could do the following: Right click on your project and select ""Add-&gt;Existing Item"". In the dialog which appears browse to the root of the directory you want to add. In the upper right corner you have a search box. Type  whatever the type of files you want to add. After the search finishes select all files click Add and wait for a while... The cleanest way that I've found to do this is to create a new Class Library project in the target folder and redirect all of its build output elsewhere.  It still leaves a .csproj file sitting in that folder but it does let you see it in Visual Studio and pick which files to include in your project. It's annoying that Visual Studio doesn't support this natively but CMake could generate the Visual Studio project as a work around. Other than that just use Qt Creator. It can then export a Visual Studio project."
80,Experimental IDE concepts ,"I am interested in building a new style IDE for a side project.  Mainly to do away with the normal notepad on steroids IDE.  I am looking for some inspiration for things that have been tried or that you have seen (or not) that looked cool and would be useful to have in an IDE.  Things that I can up with are: Andrew Ko (formerly CMU now professor at U Wash) focused much of his dissertation on allowing folks to debug by asking ""Why did something happen"" or ""why he did not"".

I'm a developer and I develop almost everything using notepad++. But now I have to create a site that normally will be developed in flash. I want to use JQuery because I'm sure javascript have all the characteristics to create the same kind of sites one can create using flash. I guess I can create it manually with notepad++ but an IDE will be very helpfully.)It's not an IDE but you can use tools like Also libraries like Edit: It is nowhere near Flash IDE but worth a try.
87,Recommendations on PHP IDE ,"  I have been a .NET developer for years but may need to work on a PHP project soon. What editor/IDE should I use? ThanksPaulEclipse PDT seems to be a good choice basically it's a ""everything"" rolled package. Netbeans have been more and more supportive of PHP so it might be a good choice too. I'm no PHP expert by any means but went through the same question about 6 months back. .Net developer background deciding to do some PHP work on the side. I ended up using Eclipse for PHP developers which as far as I know is the core Eclipse application with additional plug-ins meant specifically for PHP development. For the most part I'm happy with it. The thing I miss most though is a nice auto-formatter for code the way  does in Visual Studio.  Eclipse does format it but not in a fashion I'm partial towards. Best of luck in your search though I'm sure you'll get plenty of recommendations.  apart from eclipse and netbeans there is geany. its fast and light but has only basic features of an ide."

103,Best IDE/Editor for ColdFusion? ,"I am just starting at a job in which I will be using a lot of ColdFusion. What is the best IDE/Editor to use?I'd like to provide my personal reasoning behind why you might choose any of these editors (at least the ones I'm familiar with). Just saying ""use this use that"" is not at all helpful. To large degree the question is wrong. There's rarely a ""best IDE"" for a language; rather there are multiple environments each suiting particular needs. Here goes: 1) Dreamweaver Why you would use it: its history as a designer tool makes it much easier for ""non-coder"" types to start cranking out websites. If you're a solo developer building a lot of ""Tom's Corner Store"" type of sites even if they require some CF Coding (mailing list subscribers current specials light content management etc) its design tools ""template"" features and ease-of-deployment (ftp) make it an attractive choice. It has good-enough code coloring and code completion for the built-in CF tags and functions. It can interrogate user-defined functions in the same page. It has excellent CSS support. You can find a wealth of extensions too.  It's pretty stable and in my experience hasn't been very ""crashy"". It will do a fair amount of code generation for you as well (whether that code is ""good"" is debatable).  All in all Dreamweaver is incredible software for web site designers. Why you wouldn't use it: It is not free and it is certainly not a ""coder's editor"". While it provides for extensions they're typically interface-focused (javascript validation etc) unlike say Eclipse plugins which can run the gamut. For large projects it simply does not have the code navigation features that many coders come to expect. It's web-focused. So if you're a polyglot or even just like to dabble in compiled languages (java etc) then you'll need to keep another editor on hand for those tasks.... you won't be able to do it all in one place.  ColdFusion unit testing support is nonexistent in Dreamweaver. There is no step debugging for ColdFusion. 2) CFEclipse plugged into Eclipse.  Why you'd use it: CFEclipse is going on 6 years old now and has matured significantly. It's been quite stable for the last few years and most crashiness has been due to Eclipse itself and not CFEclipse (which was not true in the early days). Recently CFEclipse has seen an infusion of fresh blood and features are being added to make coding in it even more productive.  It contains a wealth of keyboard shortcuts many of the toolbar features people love from ColdFusion Studio days and Eclipse's in-built code navigation features (namely Ctrl-Shift-R for finding files quickly). It has content assist for native CF Tags and functions and some support for in-page variables though that's never worked all that well. It does not support in-page functions nor does it provide native true component insight (i.e. insight into components that you write and use in other code). It will support component insight to some extent with Dictionaries but even then it requires a lot of work on the part of the dictionary creator. Most people find dictionaries too much work to maintain in my experience. The lastest version of CFEclipse contains the best CFML formatting you'll find.  For me ""method explorer"" and ""Snip Tree View"" -- particularly keyboard shortcuts for inserting snippets -- have been big productivity boosters. If you work with ColdSpring ModelGlue Mach-II ColdBox and other frameworks with xml configuration files CFEclipse's Framework Explorer is brilliant. Because it's a plugin to Eclipse you can do everything else you'd want to do in Eclipse. You wanna code java? You can. You want webservice support? you got that. You want to do step debugging you can do so with the free Adobe-provided extensions for Eclipse. The large plugin ecosystem is one of the most attractive features of Eclipse and you shouldn't discount this when deciding on an editor. For example I would not want to work without Mylyn which integrates with issue tracking and in my experience has transformed the way I work much for the better. Eclipse's version control system support is excellent as well. Subversion is well supported; there's a VSS plugin; and recently a git plugin (if not two) has been accepted into the Eclipse foundation so we'll see native git support very soon (you can get it now with a plugin). Eclipse's ANT support is excellent.  You can easily plug the MXUnit Eclipse plugin into Eclipse for unit testing your CFML (full disclosure: I contribute to MXUnit). Finally I have full confidence that the folks working on CFEclipse -- Denny Mark Jim Peter et al. -- will continue to work toward keeping CFEclipse as the best open source CFML IDE available. These are some of the brightest minds in the ColdFusion community and are passionate about their mission. If you choose to use CFEclipse you are not choosing to use an IDE that will be supplanted by ColdFusion Builder. This project is in good hands. Why you wouldn't use it: it's a code IDE not a design tool like Dreamweaver. It's not perfect... code assist can be too aggressive in its suggestions. Eclipse itself especially when you pile it up with all kinds of plugins can get unstable on lesser machines.  Finally people who don't like the ""Project"" view of the world often have complaints about it because they're used to working directly with the file system view of the world. Its deployment support is nowhere near as simple as Dreamweaver though you can find plugins that get close. 3) ColdFusion Builder Why you'd use it: all of what I said previously about Eclipse itself applies to CFBuilder when used as a plugin to Eclipse. I cannot speak to the Standalone version because as of this writing it still doesn't support plugins very well. This will most surely be fixed by the time it is released but I don't want to speculate on what the Standalone may or may not do. One of CFBuilder's big draws is ""Extensions"". These are a way to plug in CFML code into your editor. It's hard to describe so I'd suggest googling for ""ColdFusion Builder Extensions"" and you'll most likely be amazed. Adobe's Terry Ryan has created ""Apptacular"" for scaffolding applications from a database and Brian Rinaldi has a series of posts on building CFBuilder extensions. These are huge and will prove themselves to be a developer's best friend after CFBuilder is released. CFBuilder's deployment support is in my opinion on par with if not superior to Dreamweaver's. CFBuilder does not require an additional plugin to do step debugging. Just hit the debug button and off you go. CFBuilder contains true component insight meaning that it can introspect components you write and provide ctrl-space content assist. It can be wonky however and does require some configuration. But please remember that as of now CFBuilder is still in beta. My best guess is that it'll be at least a few versions until all the kinks are worked out of this feature. Still it's a big productivity and learning booster to get content assist on your own components. CFBuilder provides a ""Servers"" view for stopping/starting your CF Server. It's built on Aptana and so contains the Aptana ""tail log"" view which is great for watching log files. Just like CFEclipse it has a Snip Tree View. The CFBuilder ""vision"" is led by Adobe's Adam Lehman. He's passionate about CF and is a force of nature. I have great hopes for CFBuilder because of Adam's leadership. Why you wouldn't use it: For one it won't be free. Noone outside Adobe knows yet how much it will cost however. ""Extensions"" and the deployment features alone may be worth the price. Time will tell. Because it's an Adobe product I think it's reasonable to assume that releases will come as frequently as most Adobe products which means... not very often. While CFEclipse deploys rather frequently lately -- and makes available a ""nightly"" site for the brave -- CFBuilder will most likely not do such daring-do. CFEclipse can afford to make potentially unstable builds available to the public while it is perhaps not in Adobe's best interests to do so with CFBuilder. Finally it's still in Beta and might not be released for some time. If you get it now and start using it remember that. In my experience debugging is wonky content assist sometimes works sometimes doesn't and a lot of people have experience crashiness. It's free beta software... you're getting what you pay for. But know that the more you work with this beta release and particularly if you provide feedback via the public bug database the better off all of us will be if it provides a best of breed editor for CFML. Personally: At home when I do ""designer"" work I use Dreamweaver when I feel that its Templates will help me build a site as quickly as possible. For existing side projects which require maintenance coding and easy deployments I use ColdFusion builder. At work where I do almost no design work CFEclipse has been my IDE since 2006. I've begun using ColdFusion builder a lot though currently I split my time between CFBuilder and CFEclipse. One reason is that as of this writing CFEclipse is more stable (i.e. it doesn't crash and I don't lose work). I fully expect stability problems to be mitigated by the time CFBuilder costs money.  Both CFBuilder and CFEclipse have public bug databases. CFEclipse has a well-attended public mailing list and if you have questions you'll get answers quickly. I cannot yet speak to the speed with which CFBuilder questions are answered. Finally for ""coders"" it's my experience that once you invest the time in learning the tools and shortcuts Eclipse provides superior productivity compared with designer tools like Dreamweaver. For cranking out a designed site a designer tool like Dreamweaver confers significant advantages. The answer to the best ColdFusion IDE isn't an answer but a question: ""What are you trying to do with ColdFusion?"" The answer to that question will lead you to an IDE that suits your needs for a particular project. Different circumstances or projects may lead you to a different tool which better suits your needs. Notepad++ with CF syntax highlighting. For free: Eclipse with CFEclipes plugin For cost: If you're a developer use Coldfusion Builder if you're a front end designer Dreamweaver edits Coldfusion pretty well. I use it quite often. I have heavily used Dreamweaver CFeclipse with eclipse and now Coldfusion Builder.  What I found is this:  - This is Adobe's version of CFeclipse.  It's still pretty new and getting to later beta.  I switched to it about 6 months ago and haven't looked back.  It's got a lot of wizards including the ability to write your own plugins in CFML that will run right inside CFbuilder.  It's free right now on beta but will likely be pretty cheap like the first flex builder that came out. My Choice: Coldfusion Builder.  It doesn't mean the others aren't capable but you'll spend the least amoutn of time getting setup and maintaining your plugins etc.   Since I had paid for and used Dreamweaver for a lot of years (Eclipse was generally sluggish sometimes on PCs' a while back until the excess of ram + cpu today) spending to have an adobe maintained copy of eclipse is okay with me.  The wizards available in CFbuilder especially for flex are excellent. Hope that helps good luck and share what you ended up picking and why! For anyone who might stumble here from Google you should also take a look at  and other community driven content.   Some of the highlights of E is that it will allow you to open a directory and treat it directory as a project. Hitting Shift-Ctrl T will allow you to browse all the files in your project in a flattened hierarchy which allows you to find files extremely fast. "
105,NetBeans IDE scaling on Windows 8/10 ,"I'm trying to run NetBeans under Windows 8.1 on a screen with a high DPI. Windows itself has scaling enabled to 400% and everything else looks just fine. However when I start NetBeans it runs as if there's no scaling enabled and I just see tiny little letters in the IDE. I did check the properties under which the IDE starts and they do have ""Enable scaling for this program"" checked. I could increase font size in the editor and the error log which would at least enable me to view what I'm typing on the screen however all menus side-bars panels etc remain very small which is very uncomfortable trying to work with. So any idea how I can make NetBeans scale with Windows 8.1? Currently using NetBeans 8.0.A workaround is to increase the font size of menu options. See: ).  The fix is quite simple: First set Windows to prefer external manifest files over internal ones (which was default until some Versions ago) by adding the key to Then create a manifest file (in this case netbeans64.exe.manifest or netbeans.exe.manifest) in the directory of the corresponding exe file with the following content: This way I also could fix Visual Studio 2013 and SQL Server Management Console 2012 which are only partly dpi aware (e.g. Visual Studio 2013 the form editor is unusable on 200% as the complete layout is broken). I fixed all my apps that were unusable or at least had a bad layout this way.  As this thread was the first one in my google results I thought it would be a good idea to post this solution although the last activity is quite long ago. Windows 10 does this for you now. Right click on your Netbeans shortcut (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\NetBeans) and select Properties. Go to the Compatibility tab and then select Change High DPI Settings. From there check the Override High DPI Scaling box and set it to System.  Similar to setting  if you use the Darcula plugin you can set the value for the ""Override Default Fonts"" option to 18. That has the same effect. Additionally if you change it to Segoe UI it matches Windows 10 nicely. go to display settings and change scale and layout to 100% Boom! :) Simply hold down the  then scroll up or down to zoom out or in"
106,Selenium IDE - sideflow.js loops ,I wanted to create testcase with loops. I got latest : latest from this page  How to make it work? Thanks in advance.If you want to create a loop the following is suggested. I am still learning so I am not sure but this has worked for me. Instead of  write it as Here is an example triple array looper (With static variables so you can see it changing) This is a custom one I have made notice the syntax for storing incremental variables (Such as counters e.t.c.) This looper will cycle through all of your options (In the example below there are 6*5*4=120 options). It echo's each option out once and then moves onto the next one. I opted to remove all the html tagging (So the gaps should be quite evident). StoreEval command is best for holding your loop counters because you can then use them as incrementals in one step instead of 2.

112,c++ - Run .exe outside IDE but use break points inside IDE ,"Using VS .NET 2003. Would like to run the .exe from outside the IDE (i.e. command prompt or double clicking .exe icon in windows) However still want break points to hit in the IDE. How do I set this up?(Running from outside IDE but IDE seeing it as run from ""Debug"" -&gt; ""Start"") Thanks.On the Debug menu choose the ""Attach to process"" option to attach a debugger to your externally-running application. Visual Studio enables Just In Time Debugging by default.  If you haven't turned it off you can call DebugBreak() and you will get a popup allowing you to attach a debugger.  If you don't attach a debugger then the program will exit so you could try wrapping the DebugBreak call in a MessageBox or some other conditional code based on an environment variable or config item. Since it is C the call to DebugBreak() is correct - this will give you a nasty error dialog (different look depending on the OS) which should have a 'Debug' option. If you click this you should get a dialog to select one of the installed debuggers (VS.NET shoud be among them). Selecting it should bring you to the DebugBreak() line. However this can fail if the debugger can not find the pdb files for your app - in that case you will just get the disassembly view and no source code view. You can also use WinDBG and the 'Open executable option' - again it will need the pdb files to yield anything useful.  "

127,java - NetBeans IDE 8.0.2 Support for Netbeans IDE 7 ,I am starting a computer science class and need to download Netbeans IDE on my Mac 10.6.8. The latest Netbeans edition compatible with my Mac is NetBeans 7. However in my class we use NetBeans IDE 8.0.2 Am I able to transfer projects between both versions (via thumb drive) and edit them on both versions of Netbeans? Thanks for the Help!You can try it but I have had trouble in the past with some custom Ant extensions Netbeans uses breaking when you try to use an older version of Netbeans than the one the project was created with. The other way seems to be less problematic.  I have almost always been able to open projects created with an older version of Netbeans with a newer one. I think there are two options: copy the source folder(netbeansprojects[Your project]\src) and copy it to a thumb drive. Open a new project in your pc (the one in your class 8.0.2) and go to THAT projects src delete it and replace it with the one from you're flash drive.
129,text editor - Multiple Language IDE ,I've been using Notepad++ for years and although it is comfortable I am feeling the need to move up into the IDE world for various reasons which I'll outline below. I am looking for IDE recommendations for someone who works in multiple languages on a daily basis - I am currently looking at Eclipse and Netbeans but willing to consider any option. The reason I have not made the switch to a full-fledged IDE yet is because they feel so bloated they are slow to load and eat up a ton of memory. Recently I have been working on an astronomical number of projects (5-6 at work upwards of 10 personally) in a variety of languages (Python PHP Ruby Java Javascript xHTML CSS TorqueScript to name a few). These are just the languages I am using on a daily basis - although I don't expect to find an IDE that will meet all the demands of these languages (especially the more obscure TorqueScript on the list). So what would you recommend for someone who needs a fast configurable IDE that offers support for a variety of languages syntax highlighting (preferably with various color schemes) project organization/browsing Intellisense-ish code completion? I forgot to mention I am primarily targetting the Windows environment here - when I'm on my Xubuntu machine (minimally) Geany works fine for what I need to accomplish.I would recommend Eclipse as the closest match for the multi-language requirements. There are IDEs that possibly shine better for a given language (e.g. I prefer IntelliJ for Java) but none that have such a broad coverage of multiple languages. As far as memory/bloat it's a price you pay for the convenience that an IDE provides. The  covers a whole pool of languages and above all that you get a free VM with root access. Definitely worth checking out.
132,difference between SDK and IDE ,I'm a little bit confused about these two terms can somebody explain what is the difference for example Eclipse is an example of IDE there I can edit debug compile my program but the same things I can do with SDK am I wrong? thanks in advanceAn SDK usually only includes the necessary building blocks for developing applications. This includes frameworks libraries header files whatever as well as compilers debuggers and various other tools such as profilers etc. An IDE simply makes access to those more user-friendly (or > hence the name) if you will. However Eclipse for example comes with its own compiler as well. In any case an IDE allows you to develop applications from a single environment be that Emacs Visual Studio or Eclipse. If you only have an SDK you'd write programs with a text editor compile them with the compiler (instead of hitting

138,python - JavaScript IDE? ,This is a super basic question I am just unfamiliar with the definitions to some of the terminology. I am using a mac and i'm looking for a IDE(I assume it is an IDE as that is what I use for python) so I can write in JavaScript for study offline and see my results. I have searched google downloaded Aptana Studio 3 and a few other suggestions also I have the latest version of Xcode. Maybe I am just overthinking this or it is my lack of experience but I can not seem to figure  out how to write JavaScript or other specific languages inside one IDE. Sorry if this seems like too straight forward to answer but i'd really like to find an IDE for OSX that is free writes at least html5 css and JavaScript. Yes I have googled that and how to begin writing JavaScript on a mac. Thanks a bunch!an IDE stands for Integrated Development Enviroment so a program that helps you write programs is an IDE an IDE for javascript could be any text editor write your code as regular text save it with .js as extension and add a reference to that file from an html page. I think you can use these free IDE's on mac: Sublime Text and Aptana Studio  I'm sure there's alot more just google it
139,php - Problems with laravel-ide-helper ,I am going through the Laravel 5 Fundamentals Laracasts video set but am having some difficulties with Facades in my IDE (Phpstorm 8). I have a model which uses the Eloquent facade  method is highlighted and flagged as Method 'findOrFail' not found in class App\Article. I am new to Laravel and the concept of Facades but am lost and have been unable to find an existing answer for my problem.Have you tried ? If you have problems during generation you could also just copy the pre-generated gist: Source:  As far as findOrFail goes I've had luck using class CLASSNAME extends \Eloquent instead of class CLASSNAME extends Model within your Model. This workaround will cause it to use the helper file so I believe you will need to deploy WITH the ide-helper file but I'm not certain. That will get most of them working it seems however I'm still having issues getting where to work within my Model not sure if it has to do with how I'm calling it $query-&gt;where(... but using \Eloquent seems to fix most of the methods.
141,Best IDE for Perl 5 ,"I have a good experience with Bash shell scripting and am now moving to Perl. What is the best IDE for Perl 5? Will Perl 6 kill Perl 5? Or will Perl 5 always be alive?""Best"" is of course a matter of taste. Rather than ""best"" I'll answer this as ""what editor should I use for Perl if I don't already have a strong preference for an editor?"" I went on a short quest to answer this question for my students. What I recommend now is . This is the editor available on any Unix machine and you'll need to use it when you inevitably find yourself needing to edit files on a Unix machine. It is very powerful but also very baffling. Atom has rendered the rest of this answer obsolete. ). I don't know of any of my clients using Perl6 and given this and the extant documentation for Perl5 I would reach for Perl5 with little fear of being overtaken in the near future. You can check EPIC plugin for Eclipse. Far from having all features but you can do some debug and use Eclipse feature quite easily. You can go safely with Perl 5. Perl 6 is a new language still being worked on and its date of release is unknown so you shouldn't care about it for now."
148,open source - Opensource/free HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript IDE? ,What is the best open source/free HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript IDE? Thank you!!!Most of the time when I write code I am programming C# applications using Visual Studio which is my favorite IDE. However when it comes to Javascript VS is quite poor. It does not support collapse to definitions (AKA code folding in other IDEs / editors) does not support code outlining and also has a very primitive and most of the times useless autocomplete. Because of that at some point I have started to search alternative tools for JS programming and the best I came across was . It also has support for HTML and CSS (as well as for some server side languages like Ruby PHP Phyton) but I have only used it for JS and that is an area where it shines. It has very good code outlining and one of the best autocomplete implementations I have ever seen for Javascript (even thought it is still improvable). Aptana Studio is based Eclipse and is available as a plugin or as a full package version. On their site they are saying that the next version is going to totally independent from Eclipse which would make it a lot more light weight and more performant. However the current Beta version of Aptana Studio 3 is still based on Eclipse. You can find more on Aptana Studio 3 on the official page: .This also may help: an extensive  after few years with Aptana... I enjoy using it.

167,c++ - Suggestion for C IDE? ,I used  to use gcc compiler on my unix machine. I am now forced to work on a windows machine. Is there any cool IDE or a simple editor for C with a unix terminal like feel ( on it :)) What other editors/IDE are as robust as gcc for windows? Also what is your personal favorite. I would like a try a few of the those before I stick with one. Thanks.If you are used to a Unix-y feel and are looking for a text editor I'd honestly avoid installing Visual Studio. It's a nice IDE but it is very heavyweight and perhaps much more than you are asking for. That said you might of course find that you like it but be aware that you are potentially looking at a several-hundred-megabytes download 2 gigs for the full package IIRC. Netbeans is good too but fairly heavy and a little difficult to get set up correctly with C and C++ at least last time I tried. It's a good alternative to VS though. I'd go for a more lightweight solution like Notepad++ vim for Windows or my personal favourite Geany -  - cross platform free IDE designed for GNU toolchain. Visual Studio 2010 has an express edition that's doanloadable for free. .  Personally I tend to use both. I heavily lean towards Visual Studio 2010 but occasionally compile using gcc to make sure that both compilers are working the same way. This used to be beneficial in the past (pre VS2010) but I haven't had much success in catching VS2010 make mistakes - yet.  In terms of the overall experience of integrated development debugging etc. it's hard to beat VS2010.  Net beansCode blockDev c++code lite are good IDE

179,"ide - How do I ""Add Existing Item"" an entire directory structure in Visual Studio? ","I have a free standing set of files not affiliated with any C# project at all that reside in a complicated nested directory structure. I want to add them in that format to a different directory in an ASP.NET web application I am working on; while retaining the same structure. So I copied the folder into the target location of my project and I tried to “add existing  item” only to lose the previous folder hierarchy. Usually I have re-created the directories by hand copied across on a one-to-one basis and then added existing items. There are simply too many directories/items in this case. So how do you add existing directories and files in Visual Studio 2008?Drag the files / folders from Windows Explorer into the Solution Explorer. It will add them all. Note this doesn't work if Visual Studio is in Administrator Mode because Windows Explorer is a User Mode process. Enable > This is what I do: Then everything will be added on your solution from folders to files and files inside those folders. A neat trick I discovered is that if you go to ""Add existing..."" you can drag the folder from the open dialog to your solution. I have my Visual Studio to open in Admin Mode automatically so this was a good workaround for me as I didn't want to have to undo that just to get this to work. There is now an open-source extension in the Marketplace that seems to do what the OP was asking for:  If it doesn't do exactly what you want the code is available so you can modify it to suit your scenario. HTH What worked for me was to drag the folder into Visual Studio then right click the folder and select ""Open Folder in File Explorer"". Then select all and drag them into the folder in Visual Studio. In Windows 7 you could do the following: Right click on your project and select ""Add-&gt;Existing Item"". In the dialog which appears browse to the root of the directory you want to add. In the upper right corner you have a search box. Type  whatever the type of files you want to add. After the search finishes select all files click Add and wait for a while... The cleanest way that I've found to do this is to create a new Class Library project in the target folder and redirect all of its build output elsewhere.  It still leaves a .csproj file sitting in that folder but it does let you see it in Visual Studio and pick which files to include in your project. It's annoying that Visual Studio doesn't support this natively but CMake could generate the Visual Studio project as a work around. Other than that just use Qt Creator. It can then export a Visual Studio project."

Is there actually so out there programming Haskell under Windows?I think the main IDE-ish options for Windows are in order: I use option 4.  .It has haskell syntax highlighting it only needs to switch on haskell tabulation mode (4 spaces instead of tab) in preferences but it is not a big deal.

Im loving the lighter baggage and I can do everything I can do on my laptop expect for the most important thing develop. The main reason for this is because i cant find a decent ide that runs on Android so I'm putting the question out there. Is there and ide i can run on the Android platform?Directly on android? No I don't think so.   However it is possible to install ubuntu on a tablet.  Then you could use eclipse or any other linux IDE I suppose.

188,Go IDE With GUI Design Support ,I was taking a look on Go language but I want to know if there is any IDE developed only for it but that have a GUI design feature as Visual Studio and Netbeans.You can also find an Eclipse plugin here:  However at the moment of writing this is still at an early development stage. Go isn't really designed for GUIs - it's precisely designed to meet the kind of needs that Google has. I dare say it's entirely possible to develop GUI frameworks with/in it but it's not the team's priority as far as I'm aware. lite ide is little cross platform and open source.you can try it. editor. It's definitely  a Go GUI IDE but at least for me the gocode auto complete feature is great.

192,Alternative SilkTest IDE ,"Coming from Eclipse there are many features that simply do not exist in the SilkTest IDE. My question is this: Is there an alternative IDE to SilkTest that I could use to maintain our SilkTest scripts? Something that can offer some of the power that Eclipse and many other mainstream IDEs bring to the table? Some of the power I'm referring to is: If the answer is ""No"" that's acceptable and is what I expect but I will wait for a short time to give others the opportunity to answer. Additionally we have the 2009 license of SilkTest. If these features are available in newer versions of the IDE that's also an acceptable answer. Thank you.For 4Test (SilkTest's classic scripting language) the answer is 'No'.  However for some time there are Silk4J and Silk4Net around which allow you to create your test scripts in either Eclipse or Visual Studio using Java or a .Net language. You can then use all the features the IDEs provide. Note:I work for Borland on the SilkTest team so my answers are probably biased."
194,java - Error: Could not find or load main class in intelliJ IDE ,"I'm a beginner in Java and am trying to run my code using IntelliJ that I just installed as my IDE with JDK 1.7.  The following piece of code keeps does not even compile and keeps giving me the error: Is there any change that i have to make in the compiler settings?? Or is it the code.This might help: 1) ""Build"" menu -&gt; """".Sometimes Intellij doesn't rewrite the classes because they already exist this way you ask Intellij to rewrite everything. 2) ""Run"" menu -&gt; """".  For me the solution was to fix the output directory under project settings.  Before I was using just ""target"" for the Project compiler output.  Instead I updated it to have a full path e.g. D:\dev\sigplusjava2_68\target If none of above answers didn't work for you just close your intelliJ IDE and remove intelliJ IDE file and folder from root of project:  Then open project with intelliJ. It must work now. I had this problem and I tried everything under the sun that I could think of and on this site.  None of my Java classes were being picked up after I pulled from a remote branch. All the classes had red Js by their names in the Project Hierarchy not blue Cs. In the end I tried to follow this tutorial and a few steps in tried something not described and fixed the issue: Now hit >  : I have encountered this problem with intellij :I have a maven multi-module project the problem is that i runing a class which not exist the  module within the configuration so my problem is fixed by setting the right module (""edit configuration"" -&gt; ""use class of module"")  may this help you Invalidate cache and restart your intellij it worked for me. I know this was asked a while ago but I was just stumbling over this issue and thought my findings might help others. As pointed out the error message is basically a result of the out folder. That's because when you're trying to run the program it compiles the code first and puts the compiled result to the out location and then it tries to load the compiled code from the out location. If the compiled code is not in the location expected you'll get the error.  The point I'm particularly wanting to share is that some times the code is not compiled (built) even though your run configuration specifies ""Build"" in the ""Before launch"" section of the configuration panel.  When can this happen? One situation that can cause this to happen is if you're using modules and you manually delete the module out directory. For example if I have a module named ""foo"" there should be a directory named foo under out/production. If you manually delete it the build system may not know that it needs to be rebuilt.  Even worse if you select Build | Build module 'foo' it still may not rebuild the module. If that's the case you should select a file in the module for example 'bar.java' and then select Build | Recompile 'bar.java'. Now the out directory out/production/foo should be restored.  Since IntelliJ typically knows about any changes going on this surprised me and took me a little time to figure out so I thought I'd share.  I have faced such problems when the class is in the default folder i.e. when the class does not declare a package. So I guess using a package statement (eg. ) on top of the class should fix it. I had to mark the ""src"" folder as ""Sources"". After restarting IntelliJ and rebuilding the project I could run the project without further issues (see ).Edit: You can access the ""Project Structure"" tab via File-&gt;Project Structure or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S. Open Modules Tab (Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S). I had two modules under one project. I've solve the problem after removing the second redundant module (see screenshot). As others have noted you have to . IntelliJ could not find the main class even though everything was set up correctly.My solution: delete the  folder then restart IntelliJ. Follow these steps Yippee....your code will run:) For me the problem was a special character in the file path. IntelliJ allowed me to open the project however when I built/ran the project it couldn't locate the class any more because it was transforming the file path to remove the special character and therefore was looking in the wrong directory. To solve the problem I just removed the special character from the folder name my project was stored in and reopened the project in IntelliJ."

To cite a specific feature - ScratchPad provides you with a good option to write JS code and you can use the run button to view it on the console. As you can see below it has the syntax coloring and even the options to save and open files directly from your computer. 
224,eclipse - Help in writing a IDE ,"I m embarking on a difficult journey to create/replace a IDE for one of the middleware products from Bigblue. Thy have created a IDE based on eclipse and Its a PIA to use it and very very slow even on decent configuration machine. Problem is there is no alternative to this.But i m planning to create one.So to start off i need to write a GUI in C++. I m planning to use Qt for this.But i need to understand how eclipse generate aritifacts and such. There are some graphical elements in Eclipse IDE used by bigblue. I need to create exacltly those graphical elements in my IDE. So its basically writing a eclipse IDE only in C++  but for the middle ware product only. Any guidance  suggestions are most welcome.  I know i might fail in this endeavor but I would rather try and fail than just to complain about how slow the IDE is. Thanks all. Edit : I have been using the Eclipse IDE for 5 years provided by bigblue and its dead slow I have to use their version because it has customized environment for middleware tool.I m finally tired of it.:(Eclipse by itself isn't slow and Java is fairly fast so I have to think you would win by simply doing a better Eclipse plugin. If you don't believe me or if I'm wrong then I have to think the back-up plan is to write a plugin for a different IDE. Even VS has third-party plug-ins. You can try to optimize your running environment. Buy more RAM!  A development machine for Eclipse should have 4 GB RAM. Working with less is a waste of time. Optimize your Eclipse JVM parameters - lots of articles on that subject. I found that Eclipse works more smoothly on Mac OS X and Linux boxes than on Windows. My guess is that it is probably due to the superior memory management of Unix based OSs. Personally I often find myself running 2-3 instances of Eclipse on OS X and they are all running just fine. Do not judge the entire Eclipse ecosystem by your experience with a single IDE based on it. The Eclipse platform is not slow in itself and modern JVMs are pretty efficient (although a little memory hungry). If the IDE you are forced to use is slow and badly designed it is probably due to that particular IDE and not because of Eclipse itself. I have quite a few years of experience designing and implementing IDEs and I can tell you that if you embark on writing your own IDE you will need at least 3-4 people just to keep it up with the feature set found in Eclipse/Visual Studio/etc. If you write it only for your own use you will find that you get very little time over to do real work. Eclipse is a wonderful ""platform"" for developing our own IDE.  That way you don't need to worry too much about the mundane things and you can focus on what sets your IDE apart.  A good place to start is the   The only practical way to approach the problem as described in the OP is to write your IDE features as an extension to an existing IDE framework. For a full-featured IDE you'll probably be starting with one of the following: If you write your own IDE from scratch you'll spend all your time working on the core IDE and end up with a product not nearly as good as one based on an existing IDE. Use a profiler to guide your work and you'll find the extension plenty fast enough."
227,ide-haskell for atom editor isn't working ,I'm trying to use the  package for atom but for some reason it's not working. First I have ghc-mod and stylish haskell installed in sandboxes under  etc. I'm also currently running linux not Mac so I had to add some keymappings: These register just fine and are visible in the ide-haskell's package settings. However issuing the keystroke doesn't do anything (It used to open a file and save-as respectively). Where am I most likely to have screwed up? I installed ide-haskell > finishing the ghc-mod installation but that shouldn't really matter... the links are correct. If anyone could help with this I would be ecstatic :)You need to create a cabal project in the directory you're working in. Just run cabal init and answer the questions. Then open atom in the current directory. The Haskell IDE menu should appear. I know this is old but I want to mention that if you are using  to run atom within your configured Haskell environment. That works great for me on Windows.
232,What is superior customization and changes you do it in visual studio IDE and other IDE ,Programmer using IDE more than else and mean to him a lot. But some time we need to customize it and change preference.   What is superior customization and changes you do it in visual studio IDE and other IDE? an addin that lets you use vi key bindings in Visual Studio. You'd be surprised how much time this saves! Most supiror for me is changing apperence for IDE Background and font color and font type Usually i reorganize toolbars position and i try to get as much space as i can for code window. with a purple background and a white foreground.
234,c# - Selenium IDE testscript to Selenium IDE ,I have a question. Is there anybody here who could at least give me an idea or a video perhaps on how to create a test script from Selenium IDE converting it into Selenium webdriver setting it up in the visual studio and successfully running it. Your help is highly appreciated.There are dozens and dozens of these videos already online. There is no point in using IDE. Go straight to webdriver. You must chose a language to write in first C#Java etc. If you don't know either of these it's best to study these first and then move on to Selenium webdriver. I suggest C#. You can use the Microsoft virtual academy to learn this from scratch.  Best of luck-Aaron
237,simple ide for php ,i try to use notepad++ but it don't show syntax of function. how can i solve it or may be any else simple ide? try to use eclipse\netbeans but this is big monsters This is not fully featured editor like big ones out there but very useful for quick editing and beginners alike :) Try this . StarPhP is a freeware editor for PHP  and HTML. This editor is specially  designed to be a lightweight and easy  to use application. It contains  features for both professional  programmers and beginners.  Notepad++ is a text editor and source code editor for Windows.Notepad++is definitely my favorite Notepad replacement because of the extensive features that it has built-in.I have used notepad++ and it give me a useful result. The main thing that makes Notepad++ fit well with the Firefox metaphor is the self-update check capability.  If you are thinking of trying emacs the following link would be helpful. It shows you how to setup php-mode and how to do syntax checking in emacs. I tried lots of IDE. Phpstrom is the best one I ever have. auto complete for php html and javascript. also work with VCS like GIT or others. can do deployment as well. try it you will like it.

252,Does RubyMine 2.0 earn its $99 as a Rails IDE? ,"I've seen a lot of blogs talk about RubyMine lately as a best of breed Rails IDE. Currently I am using NetBeans IDE for my Ruby and Rails stuff but I was wondering if anyone here would personally recommend this IDE and reasons why I should fork out $99 for it.I used NetBeans for a while before switching to RubyMine some month ago prior the first release.I can say the IDE is worth the entire price. RubyMine has the best autocomplete support I have ever seen. It's a really clever IDE it can understand most of the Rails ""magics"" including method references by symbols metaprogramming Rails/Ruby convention and so on. Also RubyMine 2.0 introduced i18n support for Rails and having to maintain a couple of Rails apps localized in 5 different languages I must say this is an awesome feature. It supports the latest testing frameworks in the Ruby ecosystem including Shoulda Test::Unit RSpec and Cucumber. Unfortunately it lacks RCov support while I know Netbeans is going to integrate it. A couple of co-workers are still using NetBeans and they often have problem with SVN because Netbeans doesn't auto-refresh the working copy when you update it outside the IDE.RubyMine has an excellent SCM support and ships with SVN CVS and even Git compatibility. I don't want this answer to seems like a RubyMine promo so I encourage you to give it a try for 30days then make a choice. I've tried Netbean RadRails and RubyMine. In my personal opinion it's well worth the money and I heartily agree with weppos. Your best bet it to try the evaluation version for a while and make your own mind up. I find IDE preferences are very subjective the only real way to know if it's any good is to try it for yourself. it is a little buggy and a big resource eater but has the better ""intellisense"" refactoring and complementary areas support (haml) i ever seen for ruby/rails. it's appearance under mac os x is lame and is much less usable (in terms of UI usability) than any other ide. i guess that in the next major versions it will become the ruby/rails killer-ide. i would wait to buy it as i see it as an immature project right now. Suffice to say that Rubymine (2.5 EAP version) is the first IDE I actually like. Having usedto excellence of developing Rails apps in OS X with TexMate when I switched the job and was forced to get along without OS X I was quite satisfied to find Rubymine. A veteran Emacs user (over 10 years) and recent Vim convert (gotta love the extremely powerful command system and short key bindings) I soon found that either the file navigation cucumber editing or refactoring support was quite lacking in those. With Rubymine I get TextMate-style file navigation which is just awesome the only IDE which actually has a type inferencing engine and is able to capture many run-time errors during the editing phase plus all the features I ever used in Rails projects. Yes I'm going to buy the software when they release 3.0 or so and I don't know if I'll use TextMate in the future when I get again access to OS X. They say the OS X support is very good in Rubymine EAP versions but what's nice that you can have that for every other OS as well. Apologies for answering in short. I'll add that debugging via RubyMine is very convenient. Just set a breakpoint and  try to hit the point.  You can see all of your vars set watches and investigate objects right in the debug console. I'd highly recommend it to any Ruby developer. To me there are 3 big advantages in RubyMine that other free or cheap editors/IDE's don't have (notably TextMate and Ruby VIM): I use it and as of right now don't think it's quite worth it - if you like working with a full IDE RadRails is as good (though in different ways) and free. I admit I haven't got all the keyboard shortcuts in RubyMine down so I'm not as productive with it as I hope to be but I find myself doing stuff at the command line more than I think should be necessary with a 'real' IDE. It's been pretty stable for me (on linux) the source control integration is good and it's not as slow as it used to be (though I still end up in vim at times if I don't want to load it). I'm hoping a 'plugin' ecology will develop around it. Overall it's a pretty good product but not (yet?) worth the $99 over RadRails (haven't used NetBeans) I've used Netbeans for a while(1+ year) now. and have tried RadRails too. but i choose RubyMine cause: all in all i think if you take some time to learn its key mappings you can be very productive with it. you wouldn't need to use a shell at all(well sometimes you might need to but...you get the idea). just my 2 cents I've been using Rubymine to develop Rails apps for a while now. There was a point a few months ago when I would have been hesitant to recommend paying for it.However the rate at which it has been improving and adding new features is really impressive.If you're doing BDD (with Cucumber) then it's worth buying just for the step completion and navigation. Also the features that have come from IntelliJ like Javascript HTML CSS VCS support etc are excellent.    I am a former NetBeans user.  I LOVE RubyMine!  It has excellent rvm git Rspec and cucumber integration all of which are in my stack.  Go with it.  You won't be sorry. I used both Redmine and Textmate but I tend to spend more time coding in textmate. It's a matter of preference whatever gets the job done quicker is the best tool in my opinion. Good Luck @johnrlive I love how ""project aware"" RubyMine is. Coming from ST2 (which is still use daily) it's hard not to miss the elegance of an editor like ST2 but working on large scale projects with versioning RubyMine is the IDE of choice for me. I just wish the would improve the editor and UI.  I just started to explore the IDE concept being a happy TextMate programmer until just a couple days ago. But now that I've played with both NetBeans and RubyMine I gotta say RubyMine rocks. NetBeans is cool for the price but it's slow slow slow. Sometimes windows will lock up for long periods of time while something is apparently ""thinking"" - of what I can't imagine. On the other hand even as a fairly novice Ruby programmer I was able to get RubyMine conversing with Git and AutoTest within a few minutes -- in short I got up and running and back to programming pretty quickly. On the flip side I still haven't figured out how to get it to work with Heroku or Growl but I'm still pretty new at it. I would say depends on what your looking for. Netbeans is definitely a very capable and sufficient IDE. Rubymine shines in its autocompletion and really easy Git integration. If you have a lot of money to spare I would say ruby mine is the way to go. However in my case as I am a broke college student Netbeans and/or text mate does the job fine. Spending an additional minute on git outside of netbeans and using my extra monitor for documentation has worked well for me thus far. "
254,c++ - Multiplatform IDE ,I recently realized I'm making it unnecessarily hard on myself to use 4 different IDEs for every combination of (develop on Windows develop on Linux)x(program runs on ARM program runs on local x86 PC).Currently every time I switch between an ARM project and a x86 project (often a console app to pre-calculate lookup tables for the ARM project) I switch between IDEs. If I already have  talks about building multiple cross-compilers. But I'm missing the next step: Once I have a few cross-compilers built how do I hook an IDE up to them?)You can switch toolchain configurations within Eclipse based on targets or projects. There's no need to switch IDEs it's just a matter of associating toolchains correctly. 
255,c++ - IDE that runs ON ios ,Has anyone found and IDE for programming ON iOS? Specifically I'm coding for the nds in c++ but I was wondering if there really is any IDE that is for coding on iOS.

256,Portable C++ IDE ,"I want a  ( can be portable).  > Qt Creator is a good choice if you want to code cross platform GUI programs.Qt is an excellent cross platform GUI library. The bash shell (and it's tools) + vim + cmake + mercurial = love. Bash is available on all popular platforms even windows p.s. I forgot gdb + ddd. The IDEs you named are all cross-platform and available on Windows Mac OS X and Linux. That said you only really need to make your code cross-platform (use . I love the autocompletion and call-tips features. They boosted my coding speed and productivity by 1000x. I know I sound like an ad but don't worry it's my most sincere opinion. If you want cross-platform development I agree with whoever mentions Qt. It's a really great reliable (depends on your requirements of course) and flexible cross-platform framework. Good luck! Have you considered Vim.   Not exactly an IDE but you could easily put versions on one USB stick to allow you to run anywhere.   For some things I like Eclipse but it is only portable in your sense if Java is installed on the host machine.   The other big problem with Eclipse is that it is fairly machine demanding and in my opinion requires a fast SMP machine to work well.    Frankly though I don't use Eclipse for any of the ""C"" languages right now.     A slightly tougher choice might be EMACS again using the same approach as with Vim.  That is putting multiple copies for your different target machines on a USB stick. In the end I have to second something else suggested that is the best portable IDE is a laptop.    For example you can have several very good IDEs installed on a Mac and easily transfer files to a target machine.  Being Unix it is fairly easy to install the GCC or LLVM of your choice even cross compilers.  The big problem with a USB dongle approach is that you never can be sure of having everything you need there.        Xemacs.  If you want something that you can keep on a flash drive with a ton of other tools.  It isn't full features but sure is a step up for writing software than vim.  "
257,terminology - confused with the IDE concept ,this question though has nothing to do with the programming stuff gets me bugged while I try to delve deeper a bit. I am confused with what this IDE means. somewhere it says its an editor or somewhere like its some PHP editor. I use dreamweaver normally and notepad ++ occasionally .. Is this what IDE is ? or is that I have misunderstood things.??An integrated development environment is generally a whole bunch of tools integrated into one. This includes editor compiler debugger and whatever other tools you may want to add. Back in pre-history we used to use an editor to edit the files then we would exit and use a compiler then a linker to produce the final product (actually when I first started we used punch cards and 80x25 data entry sheets and handed them to data entry operators for input into the computer but I don't want to bore the youngsters among you). Nowadays we just press the  key or if you use Emacs      
258,Best IDE for developing Java Desktop Applications ,I've been developing Java Web apps using Eclipse as the IDE. Planning to start developing a desktop app based on Java.  Can someone suggest the best IDE for developing Java based desktop apps? (One that would have drag drop for building the interface like Visual Studio)I recommend   Response to RTFM messages:I agree reading the manual is a good way to learn more about the tool. The OP is trying to figure out a few tools to learn more in depth and finally zero in on one (or a subset to meet varying requirements). To get to the first list before reading the accompanying manuals one would require some directions and help based on experience. If you had to read manuals of all related tools before identifying the tool that meets your requirement a new tool would have come in or your project would have gone past you! Response to original question on best IDE based editor: In some ways it doesn't matter which tool you use as long as you put the effort into learning it in depth. Know your tools! Read the Free Manual! In practice: you would want to pick Eclipse for SWT and Netbeans for Swing (Matisse is great when you are getting started). I haven't used IntelliJ but I am sure it is excellent. A couple of years ago I used Eclipse with  which I found very useful. I liked the code that it generated - it was really easy to take that and add the extra functionality I needed. if you aim for windows only than Visual studio is the best choice.For multiple platforms Mono is very good and it does not have java's .Of course you would use C# rather than Java if going with Mono or VS.
260,debugging - IronPython embedded IDE ,"I'd like to use embedded IronPython as a way of allowing users to script / extend my app. Running the scripts is easy enough but I also need to provide some sort of IDE or editor as well - this is the bit I'm not sure how to do. As far as I can see I have only a few options: The trouble with options 1. and 2. is that obviously they are a lot of work! (And will most likely be far inferior to ""real"" IDEs) - I was kind of hoping that someone else might have written an IronPython IDE that I could extend and embed in my app but I've had no such luck. Option 3. would be my preference - I'd imagine that I would save my script to a temporary file and then start the IDE with the path to my file as a parameter.  The problem is that in order to be able to test / run the scripts I need to set up some environmental objects beforehand - this makes testing and debugging the scripts from an external IDE rather cumbersome. I don't mind insisting that only certain IDEs are supported (i.e. Visual Studio) and so I was kind of thinking I could write out a custom MSBuild file that ensured that the environment was all set up correctly when someone pressed F5 but then I realised I was starting to be silly.  The other option I considered was if there were any open source IDEs that I could canibalise into embedded script editor. Or alternatively is there another soltion that I'm missing?The  is open source and it already has support for Python (but not IronPython AFAIK) so I imagine that might get you pretty close to what you want with some modifications.  Licensing is pretty liberal (LGPLv2 and MIT)."

On the last few weeks I've been migrating gradually to Linux and want to install a free lightweight yet useful IDE to program on C++ and PHP.  Syntax highlighting and code completion tips are must-haves. (or Emacs varying on religion) will always be my first answer to this question over any point-and-click IDE.As they write in  for Gtk/Gnome for KDE? Again it's a 'smart editor' rather than an IDE.  Seems to know how to handle most languages and once its started it is pretty smart still Java but less resource hungry than Netbeans and Eclipse. I would say ).

Currently I only know 2 IDE-Extensions: both are in a pretty early Development-Stage so I wondered are there  more Alternatives out there? Or is it common to use an Editor with Syntax-Highlighting for Node.js Development? from Jetbrains is very good and allows debugging with node.js. Every IDE which supports JavaScript highlighting will do the job. I personally use Sublime Text. While you work on node apps you have to monitor their output. I just place the console in my second monitor but if you use only one you may need to setup a build process.
274,"How to solve a RubyMine ""'ruby-debug-ide' isn't installed"" error ",I get the error: but all gems were successfuly installed: I can run 'rdebug-ide' manually: But when I start debugging RubyMine asks to install the ruby-debug-ide gem. Why? And after installation I get: I'm running Mac OS X 10.11.3.Here's the actual command that worked for me: I started getting this after upgrading from 2017.x to 2018.1. In my case it seems that RubyMine needed a newer version but its error message implied it couldn't find any version and failed to install it. I think it was trying to install it with a different SDK. Manually installing the latest  (global/default) it is using. Check out where these required gems are installed and make sure RubyMine is using that gemset where these are installed successfully. I fixed this after viewing the responses here:  The solution at the bottom suggested 'removing all my gems. removing ruby. cleaning up directories and rvm. removing ruby mine then reinstalling everything' I started with the easiest of these which was to reinstall rubymine. That solved it for me.  I have faced this issue too with Rubymine 8 rvm 1.29.1 and Ruby version 2.3.3 And upgrading the Rubymine version from Rubymine 8 to Rubymine 2016.3 or latest resolves the issue for me. Check ruby  version is same to which you have installed.With those all doneyou will be able to debug ruby. Please check x286 vs 64 version both Ruby and Rmine version. I had this problem runnin x86 rubyMine on 64 ruby A combination of matching the host ide ruby version with the remote SDK version worked for me but required a few additional steps.  I too am running mac os as my host (running mohave) NOTE: I had to re-install the bundler gem on both host and remote host to get the gem manager to install things auto-majically. NOTE: I also had to set the default RVM on my local host and remote host and unset the previous version as default in the local host preferences. Once I did this I was able to get gems in sync and remote debugger to connect. My solution was to go to Rubymine settings to the available SDKs remove the SDK restart Rubymine and add the SDK again. Since you're using Mac OSX I couldn't provide the same exact answer for you but you can find a similar way of achieving this. I'm using Ubuntu with Vagrant so you may need to adapt it just a little bit. It may asks you one more time to install the gem but then the debug will works for sure.

P.S.: I really liked the splash screen from IntelliJ IDE (15) I want to create something like that as a splash screen. //----------------------------------------------------------------// If you want to scale it in relation to the monitor's resolution I'd first get the height and width with the : Then you can scale an image that you're using for your splashscreen by using this method: Then center it on the screen by calculating the middle and setting your component there: actual implementation is up to you but these are the tools I use and it works fine for me.

Unless you shell out more than USD200 in the first year and still more than USD100 each subsequent year to Intellij you'll have to do with Emacs Vi(m) Atom Visual Studio Code etc. like solutions for source code editing without Intellisense support and rely on rdebug ruby-debug-ide (super slow!) or my favorite debugging console: pry. I am hoping for someone to enable Intellisense for Ruby in Visual Studio Code and provide a decent debugging plugin there. There are many IDEs which support Ruby. There is Ruby Mine from Intellij Netbeans has a Ruby setting. Atom has a Ruby setting and is my favorite right now. I'm sure Visual Studio and Visual Studio code both have Ruby plugins.  Typically programming languages do not come with a dedicated IDE because IDEs only help you a little technically you can just use Notepad. So it's up to you to find one that you like. 
324,split - IDE With Continual Splitting ,"I want to really learn which IDE can do continual splitting?What about ""Continual Splitting""? Try this: Open a new file on open office writer. Paste into a long code than do it: If you dont do that you can't understand what i need. I know almost all IDEs can split but i dont need standart spliting."
325,node.js - JavaScript standalone IDE without browser? ,So I have been looking for an IDE that allows me to run JavaScript just like Eclipse/VS would allow me to write Java/C#. I want to write some code and see the output on the console (possibly within the IDE itself) without having to open the browser. I know you can run JS programs from command line using . But I'm trying to avoid having to do that every time. I want to press a run button and see the results on the console. Is there something already out there. Can I configure my IDE in certain way to achieve that? Thanks in advance. Take a look at Atom 
331,java - Is jEdit usable as an IDE? ,"After some frustration with other text editors I recently discovered .  It seems like a light-weight editor that has so many plugins that it could be grown to be a full IDE.  I especially like how it handles SQL.  I've found quite a few people that happily converted from Emacs to jEdit.  But have yet to find people that converted from an IDE. I'm not trying to argue which is the best IDE.  I just want to know if people are actively using jEdit as an IDE and how it compares to other IDE's they've used.  I have been trying to get jEdit to be an IDE but it appears to take quite a bit of configuration and I'm concerned it will just be a waste of time.Based on this I think you can:  I believe that the tool that was created to do specific task shall be preferred over tool which has wider range of use. (in general) So in case of jEdit - it is great but it is used more as good text editor. And full-scale IDEs (like NetBeans) are designed to do only one task - programming thus they are better at it.And I do not know of any project which uses jEdit as IDE. (Basically there are two big groups of projects - those that still use Notepad or gedit to do coding and those that use ""normal"" IDEs so jEdit lies in the middle and is never used) The key question is ""IDE for what?"" The big IDEs (Netbeans IntelliJ Eclipse) support certain mainstream languages very well but starting your own specific support for some smalland exotic language is relatively hard in these big and complex platforms.  jEdit is a very able text editor not and IDE but it can be easily brushed up to support a some IDE-like things with relatively little effort. Your programming can be done via jEdit macros Beanshell scripts Java or any other more modern language on the JVM such as Scala."
336,php - Web based IDE solution ,"What I want to do is to work on my projects from ""everywhere"" with internet connection I tried followings: Tried to connect from my office to main PC with remote desktop apps like: Team Viewer etc.. It's very slow and boring. (Seeing what I typed after 2-3 second delay and it's really annoying) Carrying laptop with myself also not good idea. (It's weight about 4-5 kg.) Flash drive also not good idea... All my projects together is about 20-30 GB. The only comfortable way for me is:  (something like Netbeans I mean in-built project managementetc.. BUT web based).  I was looking for Web based IDE which supports PHP HTML JS and other various languages. My main PC is always connected to internet. So if there is any good open source (or free) solution I can serve this IDE either from my webhosting account or directly from my PC. (For ex. this service  is exactly what I need. But there are some problems: 1 its paid. 2 I don't want to host my projects in third party servers. I need something like that but want to instal such system on my own servers ) What do you think about this/what's your suggestion? Thx in advance...You should check out Codiad -  - you can host it on your own server configure it to do what you need and access it anywhere. If you want to work on a project from anywhere then you may want to look at using a decentralised version control system like Git instead. Advantages is you can work on any machine with Git and an IDE or text editor and not relying on a third-party web-based service that can do anything with your data or may disappear overnight. As an alternative way of solving the problem: All my projects are hosted on GitHub. I split my work between three computers. When I sit down to work on a project I run  and any changes I’ve made on the others get pulled down. You won’t have to re-sync all 20GB of data just the bits that you’ve changed. Then you can continue to work using native OS applications. You can install Git for free on your own server.  though. I use it a lot and while there's somewhat of a learning curve to it you can use it anywhere there's a console (linux or putty on windows) and I think it has all of the features you've mentioned."

345,eclipse - Installing ANTLR IDE with Aptana ,I'm trying to install Antlr IDE with Aptana and I got this error log from the Update Manager. What exactly is going on?From what I see ANTLR IDE is based on Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) while Aptana Studio stand-alone is shipped with Eclipse 3.6. That's probably the reason you are getting this installation issue. You can install Aptana Studio as a plugin on top of Eclipse 3.7 and then install ANTLR IDE as well. Checkout the  (Aptana Studio tab) for the Studio's update site. Cheers As a side note... I was hesitated helping you out. You have 0% acceptance rate so take this into attention. Others may not help.
347,python - Markdown in Spyder IDE ,I was experimenting in the Spyder IDE and learned that it is possible to define cells using the  separator. Now I couldn't find it but is it possible to use markdown like in a Jupyter notebook?No. As far as I know Spyder IDE has no markdown implemented as Jypter notebook even if it is connecting to a Jupyer notebook instance locally. I would suggest you to use Jupyter notebook for coding and annotation if you need such a thing. Spyder is just a IDE. But if you want to edit Jupyter notebook in a IDE just take a look at PyCharm IDE.

I can't seem to find out how to see if the checkbox is checked The only thing selenium ide is showing me is  if I try to record it Can you please help me and tell me what am I doing wrong? thx you very much!I have used  Plugin for If-Else You can use  to store the state of checkbox (locator variableName)  Generated from isChecked(locator)      Arguments: Returns:    Gets whether a toggle-button (checkbox/radio) is checked. Fails if the specified element doesn't exist or isn't a toggle-button. 
352,cil - IDE for MSIL ,There's any number of questions about MSIL on SO but none that directly answer this. I've been using  which does have a syntax definition file for MSIL and then using ILASM in a command prompt window. I did find a reference to ILIDE but the link is broken. Is there an IDE or add-on / plugin to Visual Studio / Eclipse for MSIL that allows syntax highlighting intellisense code completion debugging etc.?Use  (note : strangely some links to ilide are broken some of them even mentioning earlier links that are broken  but then supply a link that's broken too.  I was able to dowload it and Installed it succesfully from the link above though). further   : . IIRC Visual Studio will give you debugging if you assemble with /debug.  I think MS had a demo or sample of some VS plugin that helped a bit with IL. I'm not sure what it was named or if it was released.
353,IDE for Ruby on Rails ,"What is the new best IDE for ruby on rails development? I have used Komodo Edit and now using Netbeans 6.9.1""Best"" is subjective. I find IntelliJ to be the overall winner IDE-wise. I use Sublime Text 2 for non-IDE Rails development. Co-workers tends towards Vim. "
357,Which Python IDE has visual studio features? ,I am searching for a Python IDE with visual studio features. After going through similar questions and reading reviews I hardly see the following two features mentioned: Coding is so painful without them. Have you come across any python IDE with the above two features? of course the IDE need to have the essential features:Why not watch the great  for all my Python projects for the past 8 months and i definitely love it. I'd highly recommend it (even if it's not free it's really cheap compared to its concurrents and is far superior to them imho). Alright I found Wing PyDev have the two features! support PyCharm  very good IDE for python!
358,Is anyone using a firefox XUL IDE? ,I'm not interested in Firebug a XUL debugger or a JavaScript editor but a true WYSIWYG IDE for XUL form design.Here is a MozillaWiki page with 's XUL layout editor. I recall that it is very complete and easy to use and it comes with lots of examples of every single XUL element put in multiple layout scenarios. I believe you need a nightly build or a dev release of it which you can easily get from the website. The good thing is that besides the editor it comes with some other fancy and very useful XUL developer tools. And of course it is a great iTunes replacement ;) I think no Wysiwyg IDE available for Xulbut there is  it may help you

365,Using IDE together with docker ,I started looking into docker lately and I understand a lot of the benefits it offers I think you can quickly create a docker container and run it on different machines. Building (compiling) is also relatively easy you can download the maven image for example and just build your code. That works fine. So building is easy testing is easy and deploying (and running) in production is easy.  What I don't understand is how docker can make the development phase easier. And what I mean with the development phase is starting up your IDE reading code quickly navigate through your methods definition using the methods the IDE provides use intelliSense etc. Then change something run a unit test try a different third party library etc. All things you can do with your IDE. But I don't understand how to do this with a docker image. I've read a few posts about starting the IDE from within your docker container but that requires setting things up with a windows manager and I am not sure if that's the way to go. Of course I can set up my laptop in such a way that I can do all of this with my IDE but that way I bypass all of the benefits docker should offer. I still have to download dependencies set up environment variables do a lot of manual settings etc. And not just me but everyone in the team.  So not a very concrete question possibly a duplicate but I just can't wrap my head around it how to use an IDE together with docker?Yeah it's hard. It also depends on what language/framework you're using. But the things you mention are all easy to accomplish. For example we use Ruby a lot and someone in my team uses RubyMine to work with his code. That source code is mapped onto the container so the changes are reflected immediately. If you want to run a test I'm sure you can override the command your IDE brings by default with something custom like  or similar. At least that's what I do with VIM. Probably the most important missing part when doing dev with Docker is debugging. I think JetBrains is starting to add features to their IDE's but I'm not sure on the status of that.  Also almost every IDE or good editor has an integrated console. You could maintain a docker exec sessions opened there and run all your app commands like tests generators or any other. Even do some basic debugging. Hope it helps.

374,Monaca IDE - console.log never appears ,X-Post from here for exposure:   Odd question but only once while using Monaca IDE has anything ever shown up in the console.log portion of the IDE itself. It only occurred when I had a device synced via the debugger. I have since tried syncing it and I never get the device to show in the drop down box it usually says unknown device /www/html/… Now do know that I have put several console.log(‘test’); lines of code to try this out and still no success. I would think that the IDE’s console area would show the log operations from the emulator and not from the device debugger as it has its own log that is view-able on the device but this apparently isn’t the case. Is this correct or am I just really missing something simple here?So this isn’t that big of an issue but I figured out the problem. Basically I keep the Monaca IDE tab open in Chrome all the time (I work via my laptop remotely). When I come back after a long absence (several hours I don’t know what the time out is) the bottom section in the console has the Chrome error showing like that page timed out. The IDE is still there just that section is grayed out. So to fix this I would just refresh the page. The section pops back and all is good EXCEPT I just figured out that it is at that moment when the device connection no longer works. I can still click Run on Device and it works - syncing with the device - but the console.log no longer shows up. In order to get that back and working you have to close the tab and reopen it; then everything works.

390,java - Weblogic without their IDE? ,I'm starting Java development at a place that uses Weblogic on their production and test servers.   I'd like to use Weblogic on my computer to develop my code.   It seems that Weblogic has a development environment where a personal web server/servlet container is tightly integrated with an Eclipse based IDE of theirs. I think I might like to go that way eventually but for right now I would like to keep using the IDE that I am used to. Can someone point me to a tutorial or a book that would explain how to set up and use Weblogic that way on my computer? For instance  I would produce a WAR file with my own tools  then stick it in a directory in Weblogic on my computer to run it and see how well it works. ThanksIf you have not already downloaded WebLogic I would suggest getting started with the Zip Distribution.  It is a smaller distribution than the full installer and you can get it up and running quickly.  Here's a YouTube demo of the Zip Distribution:  and you'll have a nice state-of-the-art development solution.
393,Decent JavaScript IDE ,What is a decent IDE for developing JavaScript I'll be writing both client side stuff and writing for Rhino. Ideally It needs to run on Mac OSX although something that runs on Windows too would be nice.  Having had a play with both js2 and Aptana I think I'll be continuing to use Aptana. Mainly because I find emacs a bit hard to get my head round although I did think that the error hi-lighting in js2 was better than that in Aptana. I'm still looking for a way to visually debug my js code that is running atop Rhino...Aptana IDE absolutely. Stable great syntax support for all the major javascript libraries very good css and html editors. Also good support for php air ruby on rails and iPhone app development (I never tested this one). Aptana can also connect to remote site via ftp (sftp in the pro edition) and to svn and cvs repositories. It's based on Eclipse so it's not exactly a lightweight application. But it's really really good. You can also use it as an Eclipse plugin if you develop java wab app but when I tested it in this version about 1 year ago it was not stable. Much better to use the standalone version. If you're familiar with Emacs Steve Yegge's  is definitely the best IDE/editor (that I have used) for developing JavaScript. Notable features include live error reporting JavaScript macros and syntax auto-complete for ALL major frameworks!  If you have a very big application written in Javascript there's only IntelliJ Idea. It parses multiple Javascript files and highlights not only syntax errors but undeclared variables and functions allows to jump from function call to function definition and more. I've tried Emacs (because that's my favorite editor) and Komodo and they don't come close. I guess it's the same for Eclipse. Personally I think that superior parsing and navigation abilties of Idea are only required when you're working with crappy undocumented code otherwise I'd happily write the code in Emacs using js2-mode but I'm working with huge poorly documented and buggy framework and it really helps to be able to jump to the source of the function or superclass to check how they work.

Step 7 and 8 is done by typing following codes in command line: after this “PyS60_api.api” file is created at “C:\” and “eric_pyqt.api” “python_api.api” files are created at “C:\Windows\System32″. I add them to eric IDE by using ” Settings -&gt; Preference-&gt; editor -&gt;APIs” then compile and apply. So I think that I had done all steps correctly.

401,java - NetBeans IDE under Oracle ,"I'm a bit freaked about what I just read. I did some research as I want to start programming in Java and I came to the conclusion that NetBeans is the best IDE for me because of its capable Swing GUI Designer and powerful reporting with Jasper Reports (iReport).  Yet Oracle (who will soon buy Sun) doesn't seem to care about NetBeans. As I will start building appz in Java no too long from now I would like to know your opinion on the following matter: Shall I continue using NetBeans in spite of the rumours that Oracle will discontinue it or shall I make another the IDE of choice? PS: Basically NetBeans would be the choice but because of the current circumstances I'm doubting this decision. Thank you Oracle have put a lot of time and money into their own product JDeveloper.  It has some pretty neat features.  But it has never got much traction in the industry because many Java developers don't like using proprietary software even though Oracle make quite a big play over their commit to open standards. Anyway at the moment Oracle are still integrating a lot of their freshly acquired BEA WebLogic functionality into the JDeveloper suite.  But I'm sure that once they have sealed the deal to buy Sun they will start to look at what they can take from NetBeans.  Because whatever you may think about Larry Ellison's business methods he knows the value of a dollar.  If there are things worth having in NetBeans they will not be thrown away they will end up in JDeveloper.  So you say it will abandon NetBeans  and salvage some pieces which will go  into JDeveloper? In the long run Oracle will not maintain two Java IDEs.  But look at their strategy for handling previous acquisitions (Seibel JD Edwards BEA etc).  Oracle have kept those products current while they devised a plan for getting the customers onto Oracle's own brand applications.  In some cases this meant dumping Oracle's offering in favour of the acquired product (Seibel Analytics BEA WebLogic Server).  Oracle has made similar sounding pronouncements with regards to MySQL.  People may scoff but I think Oracle will keep MySQL going partly because Larry thinks they can make money from it but also just to spike .  The pertinent bit is NetBeans the Sun-driven open source  Java IDE that has competed with Oracle  JDeveloper and the Eclipse platform  will remain as a ""lightweight  development environment for Java  developers"" Kurian said. But  JDeveloper continues as Oracle's  enterprise development tool. I was a long time eclipse user and although I still like it for some things I believe Netbeans to be a far superior IDE for Java development.  I would say go ahead and use NetBeans.  You will appreciate it more than Eclipse.  In the worst case scenario that Netbeans is no longer supported you will be a much better developer by the time it has reached its end of life (i dont think this will happen though).   Eclipse is better than Netbeans IMHO even though eclipse doesn't allow you to create GUI. If NetBeans seem better for your needs  go with it. I prefer Eclipse but it's just a personal choice. Even if in the future NetBeans will be no longer supported you'll still be able to use it or you'll maybe prefer to start using a another IDE. Java code remain java code no matter of the IDE. I believe that NetBeans will remain supported even under Oracle reign. Since there's a lot of Java developer using it Oracle won't tell all of them to go away. You worry too much. So what if Oracle discontinues NetBeans next month? Your installation still works and will for a long time. Just keep the installer in case you have to set up a new computer. Later you can still make a switch to another IDE. Should Oracle discontinue NetBeans (or threaten to) surely most other IDEs will offer an ""Import NetBeans project"" option."
403,.net - JScript.NET Design IDE ,I'm currently using JScript.NET for a small UI application. The problem is that my Visual Studio Express doesn't support JScript.NET for designing the UI. Is there a free IDE that I can use to design my UI and produce valid JScript.NET code? I just need the IDE Design functionality to Design the application that's it. Currently what I'm doing is converting the very similar C# code that it generates over to JScript.NET but It's kind of getting annoying.I use the VS2008 c# for designerit seems to work OK... i create the Form Design inside VS2008 for c# i get to the source the designer crated... Copy and paste into my JScript... then i have to change the VARsex c# jscript i also check the output on compile. just to fix any other conversion problems So there doesn't seem to be ANY JScript.NET IDE out there. If you're just looking to design your application you can just produce the C# or whatever code for the UI and generate a  out of that. Then you can use that dll from you JScript.NET code. This is what I'm doing and it works great... it's awesome how you can share dlls across different languages! Loving .NET!
404,IDE for debugging 'C source in linux ,Recently I am developing using 'C in Linux platforms the tools like gcc are fast. But I wish it would be great to have an IDE like the VC++ IDE for windows.There are Eclipse CDT () both great IDEs with pretty much same features as Visual Studio.If you are starting developing for Linux and Windows you might want to get a deep look into CMake ( (from my desktop). That's a slightly old version so I'm sure the interface offers more by now. CodeBlocks and Anjuta are pretty fair enough as pointed out by Brian Campbell
410,ecmascript 6 - Android Studio IDE scripting documentation ,Where do I find information/documentation on Android Studio IDE Scripting? The way I understand it I can use ECMAScript to meddle with the IDE. I would like to able to search through the source code with regex using ECMAScript.
411,spring - Struts1 with IntelliJ IDE ,I have developed struts1 application with Eclipse. I had to change my IDE into IntelliJ. I need to develop a new application integrating struts1 and Spring. I found some interesting tutorials from  and Since above examples were developed using Eclipse IDE I might wonder is there is any better (easy) way of doing it using Intellij .  Please mentioned any tutorials or better way to doing this.What did you try? I got Spring working in IntelliJ using Maven and copying other . I hope that also can work for you. Configure Maven for IntelliJ if you can get spring working with IntelliJ try make it work from the command prompt with maven + your app server (I can recommend jetty) and then you can open the Spring/Maven project in IntelliJ and it will work. 
428,IDE With Autocompletion For Redis ,Is there any IDE which provides auto completion for Redis?With the ones i use currently i need to type out everything but it would surely be nice and time saving to have auto completion and syntax corrections?>  auto-completion out-of-the-box as well as inline-documentation. Start writing what you want hit tab &gt; select &gt; up/down -&gt; enter and you're done.

Short of obvious minimal setups such as running code on Console2 or using IDLE.have you looked at  (there is also a free community edition). Among other helpful features (debugger version control etc) it provides viewing images inside the IDE which is especially useful when it comes to game programming.
432,C++ IDE detecting syntax errors without recompilation? ,I work on Code::Blocks IDE on Windows. Great amount of time is wasted for code recompilation to find errors.Is there a C++ IDE that detects syntax errors without recompilation? I suppose any clang-based IDE would be an option?Microsoft Visual Studio with it's IntelliSense. You'd be surprised at how efficient Qt Creator is at detecting C++ errors before compilation. Give it a try! Eclipse has that awesome feature for Java but IIRC the CDT framework is not as powerful: it detects only vague syntax errors. Microsoft's VisualStudio which is available for free with the Express edition is very good if you are on Windows. Apple's XCode is pretty good but it gives up after only one error it's error messages are very short and cryptic and I believe it is only available on Mac OS X. Unfortunately I do not know of an IDE with this support for Linux. Configure code blocks to work with clang. Working fine for me.

442,ruby - Rails -- IDE Recommendations ,  I am looking for a good IDE for Ruby on Rails with the following qualifications: Works on a Windows PC (if it doesn't then it's not going to help me) Good auto-completion (for both classes provided by default (or by gem) for ruby and rails as well as for my own user-defined classes). Good syntax highlighter - most IDEs have solid syntax highlighting (I currently use Notepad++ and it does the trick relatively well) but I would really like for the syntax highlighter to detect which language to highlight in for the Rails views (highlight HTML in general JS inside  tags and Ruby inside ERB tags) - Notepad++ doesn't have that capability which makes the views that contain ERB JS and HTML a little difficult to read. Good debugger that runs when I execute my RoR app locally. If you know of any good IDEs out there that meet as many of these qualifications as possible that are relatively cheap that would be great!  If it is totally worth purchasing (i.e. RubyMine looks good but $69 is kind of expensive for an IDE when Notepad++ does work acceptably) then I can stomach the cost.  Thanks in advance!Actually as a Rails enthusiast myself. I strongly recommend Rubymine. Rubymine has a pretty neat debugger and I would say does a decent job of auto-completion. Give it a shot I think you'd like it. If you do end up using it try out   I've been using Netbeans I think Netbeans a good idea.  Eclipse sometime sucks with the different versions of Ruby runtime. 
449,regex - Selenium IDE Square Brackets Regexp ,I'm using the Selenium IDE and I need to select a select (dropdown) element. The target I get in the IDE is as follows: However the 227587 value is dynamic (and is therefore different each time) so I need to use a regexp. Note I also need to match actual square brackets for [0] and [occasion] etc. I tried typing this in the IDE for target: However I keep getting: Any suggestions on how to use regexp for targets in the IDE and also how to account for actual square brackets I need to match?You can use translate for generate id: I have a small example: And the xpath: The result is textData. If there are some data with generated id you can use another filter (or index [])

455,Selenium IDE - exporting test scripts ,I'm trying to export my test automation created in Selenium IDE but I can't find the option to export. I have a few test scenarios where the tests are the same but I need to make a copy of an existing test and swap some IDs for it to work. I can only save it as a .side file and not as individual Python scripts for Selenium. I'd like to export an existing script and re import it into Selenium IDE as a copy (where I can make some changes while keeping the majority of the commands the same). My Selenium IDE looks like this:  How can I export my test scripts (to Python) or how can I make a copy of an existing test script inside Selenium IDE (ex. make a copy of UAT FCC-A Application such that it makes another Test with all the same commands)? I'm on Chrome.You have  option on Selenium IDEBut only  at the moment.I hope that helps. The newest  and so on.Followed is the link to view these features. 
460,c++ - IDE showing blank console ,"It's been days since I try to make my IDE (Code::Blocks version 13.12 I tried on 10.05 too) work. Any program (including a simple Hello World! program) I would make would show a black console showing nothing but an "" _ "". I have made an exception in my antivirus (Avast!) for the file containing the IDE) but the same thing happens . I have tried re-installing twice i have tried resetting the compiler and debugger's settings to default auto-detecting toolchain executables but the same thing happens. I have tried rebooting my computer several times same thing happens.I would like to know what I can do to solve this problem  because I don't want to get another complicated compiler (I am a beginner)  as Code::Blocks fits my needs perfectly. The following codes produces a blank console:I had the same exact problem with Eclipse Visual Studio and then with Code::Blocks (I tested them all). I suggest you follow this video tutorial after you confirm the problem persists with a second IDE :  . It will take you step by step on how to install a given compiler."
466,linux - non-IDE C development environment ,"How do I set up a non-IDE-based C development environment on Linux?gcc + make + vi and you will live happily ever after! A pretty good development environment is most likely already there--no setup necessary.  This is because most Linux installations are  GCC. If I have to code on the command line I'd probably go with vi or nano over emacs I just can't cope with emacs anymore. Okay someone's gotta say it: Emacs gcc and make. If - as a commenter suggested - you're looking for instructions on setting this up there's probably no set up needed as most Linux distributions I've used come with these programs already installed. If you're not a masochist: gcc + cmake + nano ;) Make sure to edit your .nanorc file (you can copy an example from /etc/nanorc generally) Emacs + Cedet is the best I use gtkemacs gcc make but more often scons these days. This question is dangerously close to inciting religious wars.  Let me get it started: All configurations other than mine are inferior. I would recommend gcc + vim/vi + (make).  Vim/vi is almost impossible to ""just pick up and use"" because it will be completely foreign and you will struggle to even move the cursor or insert text but fortunately Vim comes with an extremely helpful tutor you can start by invoking the command > in the shell. It will get you up and running in no time! While Vim's interface is really bizarre and esoteric at first once you get used to it (shouldn't take very long once you finish vimtutor) you will see your productivity when editing code increase !"
