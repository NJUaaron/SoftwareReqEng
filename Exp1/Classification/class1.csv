1,performance - Why is the Android emulator so slow? How can we speed up the Android emulator? ,I have got a  should start fairly quickly on such a machine but for me it does not. I have followed all the instructions in setting up the IDE SDKs JDKs and such and have had some success in starting the emulator quickly but that is very rare. How can I if possible fix this problem? Even if it starts and loads the home screen it is very sluggish. I have tried the  (Ganymede). Currently it supports only Intel® VT (Intel Virtualization Technology). The Android emulator is based on . The interface between QEMU and the HAXM driver on the host system is designed to be vendor-agnostic. Update Eclipse:Make sure your Eclipse installation and the ADT plug-in are fully up-to-date. Update your Android Tools:After each Eclipse plug-in update it is important to update your Android SDK Tools. To do this launch the Android SDK Manager and update all the Android SDK components. To take advantage of HAXM you must be on at least release version 17. C:\ProgramFiles\Android\android-sdk\extras\intel\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_ManagerFor those still interested:Try using  on May 15 2012.  This worked for me. The emulator is now fast and the UI is smooth. The first half of the instructions are detailed enough so I will assume you were able to install the Intel x86 Atom System Image(s) using the Android SDK manager as well as Intel HAXM. Now to ensure that everything else is set up so you can enjoy a highly performing emulator: And start it: If HAXM is working properly you may see this message when launching the emulator: HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virtual mode Otherwise you may see this error: HAX is not working and the emulator runs in emulation mode emulator:   Failed to open the hax module  (Gingerbread)).Developing on a Mac would be better. Why use an emulator BTW? Using a real phone makes more sense. As of Revision 17 of Android SDK Tools the emulator can use graphic acceleration and CPU-provided extensions for better efficiency. The prerequisites and full configuration and user notes are at:    After these changes Android Emulator was launching in 5-10 seconds and running without any noticeable lag.Be aware that these features are hardware dependent (CPU/GPU) and may not work on some systems. A new option is the  file you've deployed. Android emulator is dead slow. It takes 800MB memory while running.If you are on Windows You can use Microsoft Android Emulator. It is superb provides you functionalities more than Android Studio Emulator. And most important it is fast ( consumes 13MB only).It comes with Visual Studio 2015 Technical Preview. I am using it and happy with it. I downloaded and installed entire VS pack I need to look how we can install VS Emulator only.  EDIT:Try  version and then go to app open Settings/Preferences the go to Build Execution Deployment → Instant Run. Click on Enable Instant Run. And After That This will ensure you have the correct gradle plugin for your project to work with Instant Run. And Instant run will look like this  However Android Studio is right now in Preview you can try it now.

And the second type is #include ""filename"" which tells the preprocessor to look for the file in the current directory first then look for it in the predefined locations user have set up. the "" &lt; filename &gt; "" searches in standard C library locations whereas ""filename"" searches in the current directory as well. Ideally you would use &lt;...&gt; for standard C libraries and ""..."" for libraries that you write and are present in the current directory. The  syntax.

This looks for the presence of header file in the current directory from where directive is invoked. The exact search directory list depends on the target system how GCC is configured and where it is installed.You can find the search directory list of your GCC compiler by running it with -v option. You can add additional directories to the search path by using - I> which causes dir to be searched after the current directory (for the quote form of the directive) and ahead of the standard system directories.

124,Any good visual HTML5 Editor or IDE? ,"Well it looks like Dreamweaver CS5 will try to smoother the HTML5 thing for a few more years (weeks actually). Seems like the next rung down is right to Notepad! Anyone know a good HTML5 editor with a visual/preview/style leaning? Eclipse with some pluggin? (Seems like the market will be begging for it soon.) Thanks  ...By the way. I know about the 'no browser support'...'not finished yet'..etc. That's not an issue for us. We are doing Safari Only websites &amp; iPhone iAd's only production...So we know what works in our implementations.(We mostly on Windows by the way) supports the latest HTML5 specifications and is quite fast (compared to version 2). There is a standalone and an Eclipse pug-in version available.UPDATE: Final release available (same link) Use  it has necessary code assists.Download in the field ""Name"" enter ""Google Plugin"" Click ok.     Wooo Yeah Start Coding.! Topstyle 4 is the only one I've com e across with HTML5 (and CSS3) support. Its early stages but it works enough for the most part. Since HTML5 is still in the works and doesn't have consistant support across any browsers yet my guess is that it's going to be quite a while before you get a WYSIWYG HTML5 Editor. In the mean time get used to editting your markup by hand in a good text editor like  has nice support for HTML5. Previously I was a heavy user of Eclipse but spend more time with NetBeans to play with HTML5 and Servlet. for online solution try maqetta and aloha editor for offline solution (download-able) try blue griffon they are free :)oh yeah one more my favorite editor :) and game editor also: construct2 Coffee Cup Just released one.

130,How do I edit the Visual Studio templates for new C# class/interface? ,"I find myself removing the following import statements in nearly every C# file I create in Visual Studio: Of course its really easy to do this with Resharper but I really should not have to. There must be a few template (class interface) somewhere in the VS directory from which I can remove the offending lines. Where do I find these files? Is there a better way to control the default import list?Extract edit and recompress. Paths are for the class template but the interface templates are in the same folder. You may want to edit the VS template file in each to remove the fact that they don't automatically add references to the assemblies System System.Data and/or System.Xml. . For Visual Studio 2012 to remove these from the default class.cs file the item template could look like this (do not include/remove using statements): Default Class Template file:C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplates\CSharp\Code\1033\Class\Class.cs More info here:  New class templates might be located in different folders depending on the project type as well. While working in a Web Project in VS 2015 I found that when editing the file  that I was able to create a new class with the default format that I wanted. Old question - new answer:Sorry for the maybe offending question: Why would you care about it at all. Productivity Power Tools (visual studio extension i would recommend using it anyway) -&gt; enable the option / setting called: ""Remove and Sort Usings on save""  No extra click / keyboard shortcuts / manual template modification etc ... since you have to save your files anyways. Just want to add to the excellent answer from Sam Harwell. There might be more than one class template for instance  has its own template at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual  Studio\2019\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplates\AspNetCore\Code\1033\Class\Class.cs"
144,VHDL language IDE ,  can anybody tell me IDE where i can write VHDL codes? both have IDES available for free download. At least as of a few years ago when I was using it regularly the Xilinx software didn't handle updates well at all -- to the point that if you decide to use it I'd recommend installing it in a virtual machine and if you ever decide to update it do a clean install into a fresh VM image. Your simulator software should have a primitive ID. Xilinx Altera Cadence ModelSim all have primitive VHDL and Verilog IDEs. Actually most HDL developers I've worked with don't use the IDEs except for non-HDL related tasks like top-level schematic capture routing and analysis.  On the teams I've worked on Notepadd++ was popular as well as Vi and Emacs.  I never had a license for it but one partner company used Visual SlickEdit for all of its editing.  It seemed like a nice tool. We used Cadence when I was doing my EE undergrad. No complaints (which is rare for university-provided software).

180,Development oriented PostgreSQL IDE ,Could someone recommend PostgreSQL IDE oriented on developers not on database architects or administrators. I.e. I look for an IDE that will increase my productivity in:1. Writing stored functions (code completion and syntax highlighting)2. Ctr+Click navigation between functions (or any other way)3. Finding All References (where certain function or table is used)4. Refactoring stored functions (renaming function or variable; extracting function etc.)5. Refactoring tables (if I change column name functions and views that uses that column should be also updated)6. Structuring my functions during the development into kind of folders (let them be finally flatten on the database)The project that I currently working on has hundreds of tables and more than thousand of functions. Currently I work with pgAdmin and my productivity is extremely low.All database development tools that I checked so far from () do NOT cover even 10% of what I expect from a modern IDE.I think the Toad plugin for Eclipse is going to be the closest thing you can find.  Unfortunately having a totally comprehensive IDE with these features is going to be a huge project in part because PostgreSQL can use stored procedures in so many different languages so syntax highlighting inside the stored procedure requires a vast amount of knowledge (in theory to be considered complete not only sql and plpgsql but also C C++ Java Python Perl TCL R Ruby Lisp various shells PHP Lolcode and Brainfuck -- there are probably more but those are the ones that come to my mind).  Consequently the only hope of doing this is to tie into another IDE. This being said I and most devs I know tend to use bash vim etc.   It is a fundamentally different paradigm but it is more flexible in many ways and the limitations you do run up against force you to design and test your SQL in sane ways.
183,oracle - IDE for Pl/SQL development ,"Is there any free IDE for Pl/SQL developmentI use  from Allround automation too. I kinda hate it dearly for all its bugs and that we paid a full year maintenance w/o seeing anything new in that period.But for some rather strange reason it still beats the hell out of all the other outrageously overprized and underfeatured tools for PL/SQL.And I am not talking about Oracle administration which it can do quite good as well thx to how fast one can script things in it.Its focus is PL/SQL not point &amp; click table creation. But than my Grand Ma could build a tool for managing tables users etc. A good code editor is not as easy. > One thing besides the countless little bugs that face every time is that it is completely ignorant to the fact that Oracle has an escape syntax for non-standard identifiers.You can't do much using its GUI with such objects but have to resort to the command window or  any other editor to script it yourself. btw the fact that I still use it and prefer over its alternatives doesn't reflect very well on  the market of commercial Oracle IDEs IMO.I think for writing DB code it is better than anything from any DBMS I have come across so far.It has very little GUI support for stuff but its different code editors are very capable and productive.  is a free PL/SQL IDE that is lightweight and fast and it's free.Although one feature it's missing is a debugger support. There's also the open source plugin for NetBeans named . It's currently (version 2.1) very rudimentary requires a live database to work on (no offline work with on-disk PL/SQL script sources) and I couldn't get the navigation (""Go To Declaration"") to work on my Oracle 10 application. I have been using Squirrel SQL for years and like it b/c it's database independent.  it does have some limitations but if I need something with more DBA tools I would also use SQL Developer."
201,C++ IDE with repl? ,I'm looking for a good C++ IDE with a REPL. The one in visual studio isn't... well lets say most of the time if I copy/paste a line in source the REPL rejects it even if its the line I put a breakpoint or step over. Are there any good IDEs or REPLs for C++?Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter built on the top of LLVM and Clang libraries. Its advantages over the standard interpreters are that it has command line prompt and uses just-in-time (JIT) compiler for compilation. Many of the developers (e.g. Mono in their project called CSharpRepl) of such kind of software applications name them interactive compilers. One of Cling's main goals is to provide contemporary high-performance alternative of the current C++ interpreter in the ROOT project - CINT. The backward-compatibility with CINT is major priority during the development.  CLing should be independant of Clang and abble to compile on any platform recent works of CERN tend to separate Cling from Clang and it's good trends. What I don't under is mostly the existence of Clipp in C++ allowing to parse javascript embedded in my C++ code and can't find a version of Clipp for just C++ / Boost / Eigen / Quantlib. Another thing I don't understand is why TinyCC with a 200ko size is abble to parse windows.h without a problem and LLVM team complaining about Clang on windows.H detonate on tarmac. All in all with fusion spirit wave and the so many people wishing for a C++ REPL why after 2 decade there is not even small version of it. Here is my solutions Forget about REPL C++ and stick to REPL C use tinyCC and expose only the functionnal action of method by using pointer function A.function(toto t) -&gt; function(A * toto t). To make it works with object method you can also use declaration as struct __declspec(novtable) A { }; This will allow binary align compatibility between tinyCC struct understanding and your true object. True you will have to split the tuple of data and the tuple of method but after all that should have always be the case in first place. Object design should have split data and method into a dual model rather than a mixed model good for bug. In many case the compiler will split the object into dual model anyway. This will provide extrem fast prototyping even for scientist and user of Cling/Cint. Second solution rather than REPL statement use the dynamic load/unload pair you setup a chain of compilation ( incremental build or not ) and auto relink compiled library when the source change. It isn't slow at all. This give the advantage to do it on any supported dynamic library OS and it's very EASY to do. Third solution the most easiest way boot a linux based vm ( install llvm tool chain) and use Cling on the vm. That won't work in a firm full windowOSed but it seems LLVM are windows OS haters.

226,jquery - Animation IDE for Javascript ,I was working on some animations today and it appears there is no straightforward Animation IDE for Javascript.  Having a robust IDE for Javascript Animation is crucial to eased development of advanced JS Animations.  With the web evolving you would think that a company like Oracle would develop such a solution.   Does anyone know of any quick and easy methods to Javascript Animation similar to the Flash IDE. Please refer to any applications on the OpenSource Market. Many of our Animation projects could be eased with such a JS Animation IDE tool.Adobe did that. Look at  and click on the second video. The current flash editor (apparently) supports creating HTML5 projects that don't depend on flash at all but are backed up instead by HTML5 canvas/svg and Javascript.

243,Selenium IDE Basic Authentication ,"Im am using Firefox Plugin Selenium IDE for testing (not Webdriver or else). Some areas of my webapplication are only accessible after basic authentication: I found one soulution by myself: Firefox plugin AutoAuth. Typing login and password at first time using ""Save Password"" -function in Firefox the Plugin AutoAuth sends Login-Data automatically if authentication window appears next time. Note: AutoAuth-plugin can´t be used if the login-account has to be changed in context of Selenium-test. To switch users when the site is using basic auth you can specify the username and password in the URL you pass to the open command in the IDE. Viewing the source code in the IDE it could look like this if you want to be first ""user1"" then ""user2""."

277,Click in OK button inside an Alert (Selenium IDE) ,I need to click the 'Ok' button inside an alert window with a  command. I've tried  but they don't do what I want. It's possible the click the 'Ok' button? If so can someone provide me an example of the Selenium IDE command?Try Selenium 2.0b1. It has different core than the first version. It should support popup dialogs according to : Selenium tries to conceal those dialogs from you (by replacing  window.alert window.confirm and window.prompt) so they won’t stop the  execution of your page. If you’re seeing an alert pop-up it’s  probably because it fired during the page load process which is  usually too early for us to protect the page. It is a known limitation of Selenium RC (and therefore Selenium IDE too) and one of the reasons why Selenium 2 (WebDriver) was developed. If you want to handle  to CANCEL it or  assertAlert ought to do the trick. I see in the docs that alerts generated in a page's OnLoad event handler cannot be scripted this way (and have experienced it myself alas due to the ASP.NET page lifecycle). Could that be what you're running into? For selenium an alert is the one which raised using javascript e.g. There is one basic check to verify whether your alert is actually a javascript alert or just a div-based box for displaying some message. If its a javascript alert you wont be able to see it on screen while running the selenium script. If you are able to see it then you need to get the locator of the ok button of the alert and use selenium.click(locator) to dismiss the alert. Can help you better if you can provide more context: Vamyip Use chooseOkOnNextConfirmation() to dismiss the alert and getAlert() to verify that it has been shown (and optionally grab its text for verification).   Problem with alert boxes (especially sweet-alerts is that they have a  delay and Selenium is pretty much too fast) An Option that worked for me is: The new Selenium IDE (released in 2019) has a much broader API and new documentation.  I believe this is the command you'll want to try:  Described at:  There are other alert-related API calls; just search that page for >

Is there anything that we could do to solve this ? P.S.: I really liked the splash screen from IntelliJ IDE (15) I want to create something like that as a splash screen. //----------------------------------------------------------------// If you want to scale it in relation to the monitor's resolution I'd first get the height and width with the : Then you can scale an image that you're using for your splashscreen by using this method: Then center it on the screen by calculating the middle and setting your component there: actual implementation is up to you but these are the tools I use and it works fine for me.  Hope this helps!

394,driver - PCI IDE/(P)ATA differences ,"I've read some articles about PCI and IDE/ATA and I'm a bit confused now. The PCI class 0x01 (mass storage controllers) contains an IDE (0x01) and an ATA (0x05) subclass. However from :  the standard was named ""AT Attachment"" for the IBM PC/AT (which in  turn meant Advanced Technology but ATA is not Advanced Technology  Attachment). But IDE and ATA are synonymous. ATA is a better term. So if they are the same why is there 2 different subclasses for them? Also in this post it is mentioned that  Both types of drives (SATA and PATA) are IDE devices. ...but when I config a Virtual Machine in oracle VM there are different: IDE SATA ect... controllers.  Also this post:  tells that the IDE and PCI are used for different connections but I tought that the ATA 'controllers' are connected to the PCI bus that's why I have to check them there. They are way different... PCI is used for soundcards video card etc...  IDE is used for CD ROMS hard drives floppy drives etc.. In VirtualBox when I attach an IDE floppy controller SCSI or any storage device it appears on the PCI bus just like sound cards and network cards. The more articles I read the more confused I become. It would be good to get some clear description of them.The terms ""IDE"" ""ATA"" and ""PATA"" get used interchangeably.  They generally all refer to a traditional 40/44pin ribbon wire HDD interface.  Note that a PCI or PCI Express IDE/ATA/PATA controller can operate in one of two modes: Legacy Mode - Emulates a legacy ISA bus IDE controller from the original PC.  Uses IRQs 14 and 15.  IRQs cannot be shared/remapped like a normal PCI device.  Only supports a limited number of IDE channels (primary/secondary).  Backwards compatible with every Operating System since the dawn of the PC. Native Mode - Acts like a traditional PCI device.  IRQ number is not fixed and may be shared with other PCI devices.  Supports an arbitrarty number of controllers in the system.  Requires Windows 2000 or later. With the introduction of SATA we have another layer of compatibility.  SATA controllers can typically be configured for one of two modes: IDE Mode - Works like a traditional IDE/ATA/PATA controller.  Allows backwards compatibility with older operating systems (Windows XP and earlier).  Note that in IDE mode you still might have the choice of Legacy vs Native Mode listed above. AHCI Mode - A modern programming interface for SATA controllers.  Natively supported by Windows Vista and later. So a SATA controller can be: To make things confusing some BIOSes will refer to IDE mode as ""Legacy"" and AHCI mode as ""Native"".  Also not all of the modes listed above will necessarily be available for your chipset/BIOS.  Older chipsets may not support AHCI.  Some newer chipsets drop support for the older modes.  Also on a motherboard with several SATA ports there may be a limitation on which ports can be in which mode. Clear as mud?  Great!  Now how does this map to PCI class codes?  Under PCI base class 01h (Mass Storage) there are several sub classes defined in the PCI Spec.  There are three that are relevant to your question. Sub-class 01h = IDE Controller Most IDE/ATA/PATA controllers will use this subclass So will a SATA controller in IDE Mode Both Legacy and Native Mode IDE controller will use this subclass.  You query other bits in the register map to determine which mode you are in. Sub-class 05h = ATA Controller with ADMA This is a special case IDE/ATA controller with special DMA capabilities. I have never seen an Intel or AMD chipset that uses this sub-class. Sub-class 06h = SATA Controller Typically this means a SATA controller in AHCI mode. However some early SATA controllers had a proprietary interface. The Programming Interface register will tell you what mode it is in. As for Oracle VM it probably gives you a choice of which mode the ""virtual"" HDD is presented to the guest Operating System.  I do not have a copy in front of me though.  Just glancing at the documentation it looks like there are choices for IDE (not clear if Native/Legacy/AHCI) or SCSI."
403,.net - JScript.NET Design IDE ,I'm currently using JScript.NET for a small UI application. The problem is that my Visual Studio Express doesn't support JScript.NET for designing the UI. Is there a free IDE that I can use to design my UI and produce valid JScript.NET code? I just need the IDE Design functionality to Design the application that's it. Currently what I'm doing is converting the very similar C# code that it generates over to JScript.NET but It's kind of getting annoying.I use the VS2008 c# for designerit seems to work OK... i create the Form Design inside VS2008 for c# i get to the source the designer crated... Copy and paste into my JScript... then i have to change the VARsex c# jscript i also check the output on compile. just to fix any other conversion problems So there doesn't seem to be ANY JScript.NET IDE out there. If you're just looking to design your application you can just produce the C# or whatever code for the UI and generate a  out of that. Then you can use that dll from you JScript.NET code. This is what I'm doing and it works great... it's awesome how you can share dlls across different languages! Loving .NET!

480,debugging - How to debug Delphi IDE? ,"What are the detailed steps on how to debug the Delphi IDE? I understand from other posts that one needs to create a project and in the project's debugger settings set the project's ""host application"" to Delphi (). Then when the project is run in the debugger (by pressing the Your project is most likely an EXE-type. EXE type projects don't need host applications so the setting is ignored no other IDE is started. At a minimum you should make your project a DLL-type: that will start the second IDE but it will not be very helpful. The technique you mentioned is usually used to debug your > code to set a breakpoint. I would first check if the hang occurs at run-time as well as at design-time.  Instantiate the component dynamically in your run-time code.  If the hang sstill occurs then you can step through the component's source code normally using a single debugger instance.  You do not need to debug into a running IDE instance unless the behavior only occurs within the IDE process. First find and open the component packages turn both the runtime and designtime package build options from Release to Debug if they aren't already and rebuild. Then save a project group containing both the package projects (one designtime and one runtime in some exceptional cases people only have one package which is designtime+runtime in one). Then follow the steps to set BDS.exe as the Host Application. I would be tempted to add some  messages to the component that you know is broken: Constructor:  Destructor:  Finalization section of the unit that TMyComponent is in: Looking at the output Events page in the delphi debugger you can figure out how far the code got and even if you don't get an exception breakpoint that you can use to locate the flaw fairly accurately you can use either OutputDebugString messages like the above or you can even just set  in delphi and turn off the breakpoint property ""Break on exception"" and instead set up a ""log message"".  These messages (breakpoint messages) have the benefit of not requiring any damage to your component in order to add some simple ""print-statement-debug"" like capabilities to your debugging toolkit. If the second instance of Delphi is not launching then you have the path to bds.exe incorrect."

But I like the beauty of OCamL. I want to give it a try. Tell me if that is normal to use OCamL for production code today? thank you.There is  as the first result.

485,Start two instances of IntelliJ IDE ,Well my question is pretty simple how do I start two instances of IntelliJ (community edition).When I have one instance started and I try to start another one all that happens is that my started instance gets focus. I'm developing Android applications using IntelliJ. Any thoughts?You need to configure each instance to use its own folders for config/plugins/system locations by editing .
