1,performance - Why is the Android emulator so slow? How can we speed up the Android emulator? ,I have got a  should start fairly quickly on such a machine but for me it does not. I have followed all the instructions in setting up the IDE SDKs JDKs and such and have had some success in starting the emulator quickly but that is very rare. How can I if possible fix this problem? Even if it starts and loads the home screen it is very sluggish. I have tried the  (Ganymede). Currently it supports only Intel® VT (Intel Virtualization Technology). The Android emulator is based on . The interface between QEMU and the HAXM driver on the host system is designed to be vendor-agnostic. Update Eclipse:Make sure your Eclipse installation and the ADT plug-in are fully up-to-date. Update your Android Tools:After each Eclipse plug-in update it is important to update your Android SDK Tools. To do this launch the Android SDK Manager and update all the Android SDK components. To take advantage of HAXM you must be on at least release version 17. C:\ProgramFiles\Android\android-sdk\extras\intel\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_ManagerFor those still interested:Try using  on May 15 2012.  This worked for me. The emulator is now fast and the UI is smooth. The first half of the instructions are detailed enough so I will assume you were able to install the Intel x86 Atom System Image(s) using the Android SDK manager as well as Intel HAXM. Now to ensure that everything else is set up so you can enjoy a highly performing emulator: And start it: If HAXM is working properly you may see this message when launching the emulator: HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virtual mode Otherwise you may see this error: HAX is not working and the emulator runs in emulation mode emulator:   Failed to open the hax module  (Gingerbread)).Developing on a Mac would be better. Why use an emulator BTW? Using a real phone makes more sense. As of Revision 17 of Android SDK Tools the emulator can use graphic acceleration and CPU-provided extensions for better efficiency. The prerequisites and full configuration and user notes are at:    After these changes Android Emulator was launching in 5-10 seconds and running without any noticeable lag.Be aware that these features are hardware dependent (CPU/GPU) and may not work on some systems. A new option is the  file you've deployed. Android emulator is dead slow. It takes 800MB memory while running.If you are on Windows You can use Microsoft Android Emulator. It is superb provides you functionalities more than Android Studio Emulator. And most important it is fast ( consumes 13MB only).It comes with Visual Studio 2015 Technical Preview. I am using it and happy with it. I downloaded and installed entire VS pack I need to look how we can install VS Emulator only.  EDIT:Try  version and then go to app open Settings/Preferences the go to Build Execution Deployment → Instant Run. Click on Enable Instant Run. And After That This will ensure you have the correct gradle plugin for your project to work with Instant Run. And Instant run will look like this  However Android Studio is right now in Preview you can try it now.

If this is better than  which  might come eventually with JSE or never at all is a matter of debate.I personally prefer . As other packages graduatedfrom  in the past the javax.annotation wouldbe a step in the right direction. I was hoping that they all have basically the same trivial implementationbut a detailed analysis showed that this is not true. First for the similarities: The ). As described in  the impact of runtime annotationsis smaller than one might think but they have the benefitof enabling tools to do runtime checks in addition to thecompile time ones.  Another important difference is > in the code the annotations can be used.There are two different approaches. Some packages use JLS 9.6.4.1 style contexts. The following table gives an overview:  use the contexts defined in JLS 4.11 which is in my opinion the right way to do it. This leaves us with  in this round. To help you to compare further details yourself I list the code of every annotation below.To make comparison easier I removed comments imports and the  annotation.(they all had  except for the classes from the Android package).I reordered the lines and .In and it has a longish implementation. From my experience If you are willing to buy into the Checker Framework just usetheir . These and other helpful Android-specific annotations are available in the : The support library itself has also been annotated with these  annotations so as a user of the support library Android Studio will  already check your code and flag potential problems based on these  annotations. If anyone is just looking for the IntelliJ classes: you can get them from the maven repository with JSR305 and FindBugs are authored by the same person. Both are poorly maintained but are as standard as it gets and are supported by all major IDEs. The good news is that they work well as-is. Here is how to apply @Nonnull to all classes methods and fields by default.See  for details.

However the JetBrains package works everywhere.

The annotation processor provides additional assurance during the software development process that the information conveyed by the application of these annotations is accurate including in cases of method inheritance. One of the nice things about IntelliJ is that you don't need to use their annotations. You can write your own or you can use those of whatever other tool you like. You're not even limited to a single type. If you're using two libraries that use different @NotNull annotations you can tell IntelliJ to use both of them. To do this go to ""Configure Inspections"" click on the ""Constant Conditions &amp; Exceptions"" inspection and hit the ""Configure inspections"" button. I use the Nullness Checker wherever I can so I set up IntelliJ to use those annotations but you can make it work with whatever other tool you want. (I have no opinion on the other tools because I've been using IntelliJ's inspections for years and I love them.)"

11,javascript - How do I get started with Node.js ,Are there any good resources to get started with Node.JS? Any good tutorials blogs or books? Of course I have visited its official website  but I didn't think the documentation they have is a good starting point. Use the source Luke. No but seriously I found that building Node.js from source running the tests and looking at the benchmarks did get me on the right track. From there the .js files in the lib directory are a good place to look especially the file http.js. Update: I wrote this answer over a year ago and since that time there has an explosion in the number of great resources available for people learning Node.js. Though I still believe diving into the source is worthwhile I think that there are now better ways to get started. I would suggest some of the books on Node.js that are starting to come out.
23,Can IntelliJ IDEA encapsulate all of the functionality of WebStorm and PHPStorm through plugins? ,"I am in the market for a new IDE but am confused about the overlap between some of Jetbrains' offerings. It looks like IntelliJ IDEA has plugins that allow you to do Node.js and php development.

I am hoping to have a single polyglot IDE for all development.All of the functionality of our lightweight IDEs can be found within IntelliJ IDEA (you need to  Definitely a great question.I've noted this also as a sub question of the choice for versions within IDEa that this link may help to address...  it as well potentially possesses a ground work for looking at your other IDE choices and the options they provide. I'm thinking WebStorm is best for JavaScript and Git repo management meaning the HTML5 CSS Cordova kinds of stacks which is really where (I believe along with others) the future lies and energies should be focused now... but ya it depends on your needs etc. Anyway this tells that story too... intellij idea is the best IDE on market. I supports all the fetures of its lightweight IDEs like webStrom pyCham etc. It even works sama as Android Studio.There are only 2 differences1. Creation (""Open Directory"") used in lighter products2. It consumes a lot of memory processor and specially BATTERIES (as its like a super set of all ides)"
28,macos - What's a good IDE for Python on Mac OS X? ,I'm about to start a new job where the coding practices are heavily centered around TDD and refactoring and whose primary development language is Python.  I come from the Java world and have been a confident user of Eclipse for a good long time.  When not working in Java I use emacs. I'm looking for an IDE for Python that will give me a lot of the capabilities I've grown used to with Eclipse not only for refactoring but in terms of code completion project management SCM integration (currently CVS but likely to switch to git one of these days) et al. What IDE should I use?Have tried many different (Kate Eclipse Scite Vim Komodo): each one have some glitches either limited functions or slow and unresponsive. Final choice after many years: Emacs + ropemacs + flymake. Rope project file open dialog is extremely quick. Rope refactoring and code assist functions are super helpful. Flymake shows syntax mistakes. Emacs is the most configurable editor. I am very happy with this config.  Python related part of config is here: public.halogen-dg.com browser/alex-emacs-settings/configs/cfg_python.el My 2 pennies check out PyCharm It's lightweight and offers Code Completion. Costs money. EDIT:Apparently Chocolat was an interesting option in 2013 but since then many others came up and development stalled. Nowadays I recommend Visual Studio Code + Python Plugin.

35,debugging - IDE and Debugger for node.js ,I am going to start building project in node.js (was working in PHP before) What is the IDE Debugger and Helping Tools for node.js to help improvement while coding ?There are several IDEs which support Node.js natively: WebStorm 3.0 does all this stuff.It auto completes in a smart way includes nice debugging and unit testing. It also include number of inspection for javascript which is also pleasant.Now RC version is available but JetBrains assure that it'll be released soon.

Is there a way to force Eclipse to run the program as a top level process or at least create a Console that the JVM will recognize? Otherwise I'm forced to jar the project up and run on a command-line environment external to Eclipse.I assume you want to be able to use step-through debugging from Eclipse. You can just run the classes externally by setting the built classes in the bin directories on the JRE classpath. You can debug using the remote debugger and taking advantage of the class files built in your project. In this example the Eclipse project structure looks like this:  So all you have to do any time you want to debug the app is: You can track this issue in  offers alternatives to using System.console(). One is to use a BufferedReader wrapped around System.in the second is to use a Scanner wrapped around System.in.

49,Which IDE for Scala 2.8? ," is the same question for older version of Scala but they say that Eclipse plugin has been improved vastly. Is it the best IDE now? How do different Scala IDE compare today? I've been pretty successful with IDEA 9. I've briefly tried both Netbeans and Eclipse and wasn't able to get what I wanted. Eclipse's code-complete didn't behave as well as I'd have liked and I couldn't find a way to make Netbeans handle Scala scripts; It'd just complain that the file wasn't a class. To be clear I've been using IDEA for a few years for Java so keep that in mind:) For the moment Scala Plugin in IntelliJ IDEA is the best. It handles Scala 2.8 well. IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition is now free and open source (and works with Scala) so I can't see any reason for not using it. The plugin is still somewhat buggy (many ""false negatives"" i.e. the code without red underscores may not compile successfully; but almost no ""false positives"") but perfectly usable. The best thing is that you can use IDEA's excellent debugger with Scala (not without some issues but it actually works!). FSC (Fast Scala Compiler) is also supported in latest builds. A huge time-saver. The plugin development team is quite responsive. Some of the guys work directly in JetBrains and possess intimate knowledge about IDEA platform so the development progresses fast. JetBrains IDEA's Scala plug-in handles 2.7 and 2.8 equally well. I cannot make any comparisons because I have used only IDEA. Using Eclipse Helios with the dev-version of the new Scala(2.8) plugin as there isn't an official release yet. That > beta definitively -- but I can't confirm the frequently expressed opinion that this plugin is outright horrible ;-) I'd say the experience is already OK-ish and indeed better than the current state of affairs with the Groovy plugin. OTOH the experience with plain Java is way more smooth (feels like flying at times) and the current CDT I'd rate somewhat in between. Incremental compile and error highlighting work quite well for me; tweaking a DSL implementation into form just by continuously rewriting your code until the error markers are gone -- without ever having to test-run your program -- is outright fun and just again shows that FP / static typing rocks! Problems encountered from time to time:- implicits and nested types in other compilation units (esp. nested / super packages) aren't picked up at times when there are still other errors around; they will be picked up after an full build- there seems to be a memory leak in the version I'm using right now (from end august 2010) necessitating to restart the workbench after some hours of work- beware when you're using AspectJ to make sure you get a version of the Scala plugin which relies on a JDT weaving bundle version which also works with AJDT PS: I'm using maven builds in all my projects and generated the eclipse projects with the eclipse-maven-plugin and then imported them as plain-flat eclipse projects. I can just strongly recommend everyone to keep away from the M2-eclipse plugin (for maven) in its current (2010) state it makes your workbench painfully slow is buggy and has lots of almost unpredictable behaviour because it constantly tries to do magic things behind the scenes (and besides that the aspectj support is broken since this spring) i use both eclipse and IDEA eclipse supports type detection isbetter than IDEA (it is veryneccessery thing if you want programin functional style that you can beaware from type of expressions andvariables.) : IDEA supports type detection like eclipse but you haveto define a value in your functionsfor example: deftestTs[A](a:List[String]b:List[A])= for{      ai &lt;- a      bi &lt;- b    }  yield (aibi)   }deftestTs[A](a:List[String]b:List[A]):List[(StringA)]={    val result = for{      ai &lt;- a      bi &lt;- b    }  yield (aibi)   }I think that the best option so far is the ScalaIDE for Eclipse. You can go to the ScalaIDE Web Site and look around to see by yourself.  to get an idea. For everyone who is really considering doing some serious development with Scala I strongly recommend to evaluate the IDEs in question beyond the basics. When you are into an agile approach which in my option requires a painless refactoring support without surprises (especially in multi-module projects) things are pretty tight at the moment. It would be pretty neat if someone came up with a IDE independent specification-like list of refactorings (and desired outcomes) which could be used to verify an IDE's refactoring support. The officially endorsed and supported (by Typesafe) for Scala 2.9 is Eclipse. The current version is far superior to prior versions and includes a context-aware REPL full-featured debugger and even the ability to debug REPL statements.  I think this question needs to be updated and the answers revisited. I don't recommend the Scala IDE/Eclipse.  It doesn't have a lot of the features that are even available for Eclipse with Java.  And there are bugs. I am using the latest NetBeans and haven't tried anything else. I've met at least 2 notable bugs in NetBeans while coding in Scala: One: NB occasionally come unable to run a program hanging on classpath scanning.Solution: Create a new project copy your code there and go on.Comment:  of particular namespaces or classes and complains when you use them.Solution: Just ignore and go on - compiler founds no errors and the program works. I'd recommend IDEA's plugin for now. The Scala plugin for NetBeans is quite nice too. It doesn't yet support NetBeans 6.9 the newest release though and you still need to download it manually instead of installing it directly from the plugin manager inside NetBeans.  However it integrates better with Maven projects than IDEA's plugin does (this is true for NB and IDEA in general in my opinion). It partly depends on your style of working as all the options have strengths and weaknesses. If you need refactoring across mixed java/scala projects then IntelliJ is your only option. If you want to do any work on the compiler or a compiler plugin then Eclipse has the advantage of being able to launch a runtime workspace with a custom compiler build including breakpoints.  It also improved massively for the 2.8 Scala release. Netbeans is a fine choice to go with if you're already very familiar with that platform the costs of learning a new environment may well outweigh any benefits and all three solutions are improving rapidly. I haven't tried netbeans scala plugin yet but I find that Intellij IDEA plugin is at any way much better a scala ide than the Scala eclipse plugin which is sooooo slow that drives me crazy.Though swing applications don't work well with my tiling window manager. try IDEAX the latest community edition of Intellij IDEA (version 10) it has improved scala plugin which has faster code compilation and exceution in addition to that it has Maven3 and SBT support with which we can develop Lift applications. IntelliJ IDEA community edition + Scala Plugin + SBT plugin"

57,Professional VHDL IDE? ,Is there a good IDE to work with VHDL projects ?Or are most of the professionals working with emacs/vim/notepad++ ?I use Emacs+VHDL-mode which is great if you don't mind (or have already climbed) the learning curve of Emacs. Alternatively you could try  for simulation. But I am no professional so I suppose they are using some of the former two products. Engineers in large semiconductor companies are using emacs/vim for code editing. Integrated Development Environment doesn't make much sense there since a > is a few thousand HDL files taken from different places on a *NIX network setup scripts for a dozen different tools and cron jobs to do frequent builds. For simpler FPGA projects developed on Windows I've seen people using Borland CodeWright UltraEdit and Crimson Editor.     My best bet is to use VIM to do whatever i need to for VHDL formatting. VIM has an extremely powerful facility to develop custom plugins and no amount of IDE hopping will give you all the customization you would ever need.  Things like signal names &lt; 20 characters procedure lengths &lt; 100 lines no use of linkage ports -- all of these can be coded in VIM with minimal effort. You could actually run vcom or ncvhdl from within VIM and then see where the errors are.  Having said all this you might want to take a look at what Sigasi has to offer. If you need more help on this let me know -- it'd be fun coding a VIM plugin.  Emacs + VHDL mode + a compiler / simulator + source control. The VHDL mode is configured to use the compiler to compile the design and optionally run the simulation. Emacs can link with the source control to correctly check in diff and tag. I personally like this set up because the editor is open source and I can use it anywhere (Mac Linux Windows). The compiler / simulator can be anything from a free download (FPGA vendor sponsored Modelsim or GHDL) to a grid engine. Once set up it pretty much becomes invisible. Simplifide also has an eclipse plugin which supports VHDL Verilog and SystemVerilog which contains all of the standard IDE features and more.  It can be downloaded at . It's a plugin I'm working on that provides syntax checking based on simulators/compilers. I'm using daily with ModelSim and so far works nice. Emacs with the appropriate language mode is my vote. Basic editing is easy enough to learn and there are a lot of example config files out there.Kevin. I'm using Xilinx ISE for educational purposes it works really well. And it has everything. After applying for a student license the student version it free to use but it takes up a lot of space. The installation file alone is more than 6 gb. The book we use for school is referring to xilinx special properties. (“FGPA Prototyping by VHDL Examples”). I'm also programming on a nexsys 3 spartan 6 testboard and I'll be using xilinx for another year but when I finish the course I’m gonna look for something smaller. Happy to read about the lightweight alternatives.
