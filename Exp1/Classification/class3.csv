65,ide - Is there a way to collapse all code blocks in Eclipse? ,"Eclipse has that ""+/-"" on the left to expand and collapse blocks of code. I've got tens of thousands of lines to go through and would really like to just collapse everything and selectively expand blocks to look at them.There is a hotkey mapped by default to  close all code blocks is "
79,Using Vi Vim or GVim as an IDE ,I am forced to use VS2008 for the bulk of my projects at work but whenever the odd text file needs editing I use Vim. Now I know that there are plugins and whatnot that can make VIM work like an IDE so I am wondering if anyone actually uses it as an IDE? EDIT: For those of you who think you speak for the masses in saying that Vim should not be used as an IDE please consider that IDE features are the number one feature request on the .Vim is an amazing piece of software but pretty messy too due to it's age. . Omni-completion requires file-type specific plugins the This project make vim as a IDE for multi-language developing. I sometimes use Vim as an IDE within  plugin that gives you similar powers that you have in Microsoft's Database Management Studio.
86,scala - Any IDE supporting SBT? ,is any IDE supporting SBT in a proper way (like Maven for example)? Because I've found a lot of tools that > but I haven't found any plugins that give any support of SBT interaction form within IDE. I want to make an IDE-agnostic project based on SBT but also I want to be able to use full spectrum of features that IDE provide and not just use it as an editor and do all the other stuff from console.Does  (and a Scala plugin obviously!) I know this isn't exactly what you're looking for but putting it here as a work-around for working with SBT in eclipse for whoever is interested. SBT generates eclipse config files but after you import it it works fine from within eclipse. You just need to set up the project for the first time outside of Eclipse run SBT to resolve dependencies generate eclipse structure using the eclipse sbt plugin and import into Eclipse. After that you can run the code directly from Eclipse and it works fine. Here're the steps in detail: Create the folder structure as follows:
132,difference between SDK and IDE ,I'm a little bit confused about these two terms can somebody explain what is the difference for example Eclipse is an example of IDE there I can edit debug compile my program but the same things I can do with SDK am I wrong? thanks in advanceAn SDK usually only includes the necessary building blocks for developing applications. This includes frameworks libraries header files whatever as well as compilers debuggers and various other tools such as profilers etc. An IDE simply makes access to those more user-friendly (or > hence the name) if you will. However Eclipse for example comes with its own compiler as well. In any case an IDE allows you to develop applications from a single environment be that Emacs Visual Studio or Eclipse. If you only have an SDK you'd write programs with a text editor compile them with the compiler (instead of hitting 
158,git coding with IDE ,I'm new to Git. Before using Git I used Subversion for my web project. One thing I'm wondering is how to code on an IDE when working with GIT. As for SVN only one version of code is locally stored on your computer so we just have to open and edit that version directly before committing it to the remote repo. However for Git we have multiples revisions stored locally so I don't know how to work using an IDE. Must the IDE support Git? Currently I'm only managing to code using an integrated editor in Terminal which is not very convenient.I don't understand how the IDE is relevant. You just commit whenever you want as normal and then when you want to push to a remote repository you do so. It's a bonus if the IDE supports Git of course as then you don't need to switch between a console and the IDE but it certainly doesn't > to. The IDE should ignore Git's repository just as it would have to ignore the .svn directories for Subversion. Certainly working with Visual Studio - even without any plugins - has given me no Git-related problems. A lot of major IDEs have some support for Git. It usually comes from a plugin not from the core functionality of the IDE. At the very least the git integration of your IDE should allow you to commit and push to the remote repo. It may also work on earlier commits etc. Your mileage may vary depending on your language of choice what IDE you're using and your platform. All of this is just a wrapper for system commands so there's nothing that you won't be able to do it might just not be convenient. I agree with Jon -- the IDE is irrelevant. You'd just work normally. If you point the IDE to the right directory it'll show the code and let you work on it. With git you have the master branch to which you usually commit your changes. There is no difference to SVN cause in SVN you usually commit to the trunk. If you are working with branches you will change to the branch either with SVN or with Git and do your commits there. That's it. One of the differences between Git and SVN in this use case is you have the whole history availabe while working with Git. As Jon has already mentioned the .git folder that contains all versions is hidden from the IDE. You always have one version checked out in your work directory which just contains ordinary source code. I work with Netbeans for which an plugin exists that supports some very basic features of GIT. It highlights lines that have been changed added or deleted compared to the previous version which is quite useful. For branching commiting and so on I use a terminal.
178,java - Files edited outside the ide ,"If I run a script to edit files outside of the ide I am using will the ide recognize the changes made to the files? More specifically:-IDE: Netbeans 6.8-Version Control: CVS-OS: Windows XPIn general yes. But the form designer of NetBeans considers some parts of the code ""private"" and you shouldn't modify these parts externally. They are identified by comments in the generated code: These parts are in fact generated from an external proprietary .form file and having the source code not aligned with the .form code will mess everything up. Yes it should. Give it a whirl and check it out. Yes with some caveats: If you have those files open edited and unsaved in the IDE at the time then you will need to tell the IDE whether to discard or keep your in-IDE changes. If you have them open and unedited then depending on the IDE you may have to tell it to reload those files (the IDE should warn you that the file has changed since you last opened it). If you move files around and your IDE has some kind of project file (that tells it among other things where all the files are) and you don't update it accordingly you may have problems. Any files that you don't already have open in your IDE should behave as expected and I would consider it a bug if it didn't pick up the changes."
185,c# - UML and favourite IDE ,I've just downloaded Visual Paradigm for UML and it looks quite ok. Does anyone have any experience with it? Or maybe someone has his own favourite IDE which is worth using and wouldn't mind sharing this knowledge? Do not want to use IDE which is written in JAVA or C# for patriotic reasons.I would recommend you Visual Paradigm. It is has very intuitive interface and it is easy to use. I use it at the moment. But if you want to try something else this page could be helpful . The best modeling tool for Eclipse is Omondo.  It is just magic but also  !!
186,Zend Framework IDE ,I am assigned to work on a project which is developed in Zend Framework 1. I just know PHP language and I am studying the Zend Framework. I want to setup the Zend Framework project in IDE. I googled and came across Zend Studio which is paid. Is there any other community edition IDE in which I can work on the ZF1 project smoothly and can someone provide a link for the tutorial to setup the project?I would recommend using Eclipse for PHP:  Zend Studio is built on Eclipse and having used both myself I can tell you they are very similar.  Once you have Eclipse up and running you can add the Zend Framework 1 library so that you will have auto-complete and framework documentation available in real time.
206,IDE for programming in metalanguage? ,I've recently started learning metalanguage. Is there a jetbrains IDE for it? If not which is the best IDE for metalanguage programming. Doesn't have to be open source. Thanks.Nah JetBrains doesn't have an IDE for ML. Look here: 
208,C++ IDE that autogenerates cmakelists.txt ,I'm looking for an IDE that automatically generates a cmake file from the project. Ideally I would like the project to be independent of the IDE. I am mainly working under linux but Windows is a major (and great) OS so ideally it would run on Windows as well. I'm not too bothered about that though as on Windows there is VS :). Regards EDIT: Yeah I sort of see my mistake. I should have asked for an IDE that generates makefiles instead of cmake files since the cmake layer/step becomes useless (if the IDE can directly generate a makefile).The purpose of CMake is to generate the  file by hand - and KDevelop helpfully updates the GUI appropriately to reflect my changes.
229,c++ - IDE for gcc compiler ,  I've downloaded MinGW and I require an IDE for compiler.I'm going for eclipse atm which one would you suggest?Eclipse is good. Netbeans is good. DevC++ is good. Now you choose :-) Eclipse is quite good haven't tried any other IDE so can't comment further  but I haven't used the combination myself.
300,Processing 3 IDE is half cyrillic ,Recently I started to find interest in Processing and decided to download the offical Processing 3 IDE from  I already tried to change the configuration language etc. Also I downloaded the IDE to my workplace notebook and on the notebook the IDE was complete in normal english. Now I dont know how to fix this problem because there are no informations about a problem like this with the Processing 3 IDE.A few things to try - you may have already.  This is a solution which has worked for others experiencing this exact issue:
325,node.js - JavaScript standalone IDE without browser? ,So I have been looking for an IDE that allows me to run JavaScript just like Eclipse/VS would allow me to write Java/C#. I want to write some code and see the output on the console (possibly within the IDE itself) without having to open the browser. I know you can run JS programs from command line using . But I'm trying to avoid having to do that every time. I want to press a run button and see the results on the console. Is there something already out there. Can I configure my IDE in certain way to achieve that? Thanks in advance. Take a look at Atom

381,python sleep == IDE lock up ,When my script sleeps for 50sec my IDE locks up which is very annoying. I cant switch tabs look through my source type code etc. It happens in pylde and pyscripter i havent tried other IDEs. What can i do to fix this? i'm actually doing  hoping the IDE will update once per second but it doesnt look that way. What can i do to fix this?I'm assuming you are running your code from within the IDE? Your IDE is probably blocking while running your code. Look for a setting of some sort which might control that behaviour otherwise I think your only choice would be to change IDE. (Or run your code from outside the IDE) Can you configure to run your script externally? I don't know about the specific IDEs but I would try to spawn a different process for the debugged script and not run them under the IDE. If that doesn't help then it is a problem of the IDEs. The problem is your IDE not python. I don't use sleep that often I've just tried it on the  IDE uses the background thread approach and it does not have this problem.
383,python - Bpython-like editor/IDE? ,I love bpython's fast comprehensive autocompletion and I'd really like to use it right inside my editor/IDE. Is there a way to integrate it into vim/gedit/eclipse/etc? Thanks.I had a similar question. I wanted to have bpython in Vim as i was getting tired of switching between terminal and Vim. Turns out there is a fantastic plugin ( as there usually are for Vim :) called  and smile :) I think it works for Ipython and others as well.. 
426,php - IDE with specific features ,I'm looking for an IDE that has the following features: The last two are optional but the first three I really need. Any suggestions? IDE has this features (and much more).
436,What IDE support semantic highlighting? ,After reading the  I'm unable to find a list of IDE that provide this feature (natively or with plugin). Do you know of Checking again I find the following editors/IDEs have support
440,eclipse - Error in scala IDE ,I not really understand what this error means? This is occur when I delete some source file. Is there any good IDE for scala development beside eclipse? If you delete a file sometimes the IDE doesn't catch that it needs to recompile and so it gets confused about what happened to the file.   To fix go to  and clean the project.  This will force it to inspect the files and recompile.
465,Is there a C++ IDE which handles templates well? ,Every IDE I've tried fails to provide code-completion when something template-related is used.For example  Is there IDE that can provide code completion in this case?Actually this is a fairly simple template use-case ) handles this pretty well. Netbeans sometimes gets it right but not always. It's non-deterministic: seemingly similar code may get parsed or not depending on the whim of the IDE.
468,c++ - Input redirect using IDE (Windows) ,How do I use Input Redirect using an IDE (Windows)? I already tried with both Code::Blocks and Orwell Dev C++ the following program arguments and it didn't worked: Using Dev C++ I printed all the argv and I got the following So the IDE was passing the argument but it wasnt't reading anything from the file. What could be the problem here? The Windows the IDE or something else? I tried with > using a Code::Blocks and Linux and worked fine so I'm really clueless.Another IDE that you know how to input redirect could solve my problem too.Thanks.
