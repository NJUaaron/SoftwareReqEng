13,What is the best project structure for a Python application? ,Imagine that you want to develop a non-trivial end-user desktop (not web) application in Python. What is the best way to structure the project's folder hierarchy? Desirable features are ease of maintenance IDE-friendliness suitability for source control branching/merging and easy generation of install packages. In particular:Doesn't too much matter.  Whatever makes you happy will work.  There aren't a lot of silly rules because Python projects can be simple. And the top-level directory can contain README's Config's and whatnot. The hard choice is whether or not to use a ).
42,Difference between framework vs Library vs IDE vs API vs SDK vs Toolkits? ,I want some examples. I always get confused so with some examples I might be able to figure it out better. Also: Is Eclipse an API or IDE?An : While not the prevalent notion a framework can be viewed as a kit. It also has a library (or a collection of libraries that work together) that provides a specific coding structure &amp; pattern (thus the word >). (e.g. Spring Framework) Consider Android Development: IDE: Eclipse etc.. Library: android.app.Activity library (Class with all code) API: Interface basically all functions with witch we call  SDK: The Android SDK provides you the API libraries and developer tools necessary to build test and debug apps for Android(----tools - DDMSEmulator ----platforms - Android OS versions ----platform tools - ADB ----API docs) ToolKit: Could be ADT Bundle Framework: Big library but more of architecture oriented SDK represents to software development kit and IDE represents to integrated development environment.  The IDE is the software or the program is used to write compile run and debug such as Xcode.  The SDK is the underlying engine of the IDE includes all the platform's libraries an app needs to access. It's more basic than an IDE because it doesn't usually have graphical tools. In other words... Even your notepad is an IDE. Every software you write/compile code with is an IDE.   A bunch of code which simplifies functions/methods for quick use. A programming interface for functions/configuration which you work with its usage is often documented. Extras and/or for development/testing purposes.  Tiny apps for quick use often GUIs.  Apps with a graphical interface requires no knowledge of programming unlike APIs. Bunch of APIs/huge Library/Snippets wrapped in a namespace/or encapsulated from outer scope for compact handling without conflicts with other code. A design pattern separated in Models Views and Controllers for huge applications. They are not dependent on each other and can be changed/improved/replaced without to take care of other code. The object that is being  presented.  Example in IT: A HTML form.  Example in IT: Browser that renders a website with the form.  Example in IT: Functions which handle form data that's being submitted.Small codes of only a few lines may not be even complete but worth for a quick share. Exclusive functions for specified frameworks/APIs/libraries only. Additional modules or services for specific GUIs.

The argument of  searches a sequence of implementation-defined places for a header identified uniquely by the  specified sequence between the &lt; and &gt; delimiters and causes the  replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the header.  How the places are specified or the header identified is  implementation-defined. 3 A preprocessing directive of the form  causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the source file identified by the  specified sequence between the "" delimiters.

A preprocessing directive of the form (that does not match one of the two previous forms) is permitted. The preprocessing tokens after  defined folders. In C++ include a file in two ways: The first one is #include  which tells the preprocessor to look for the file in the predefined default location.This location is often an INCLUDE environment variable that denotes the path to include files. And the second type is #include ""filename"" which tells the preprocessor to look for the file in the current directory first then look for it in the predefined locations user have set up. the "" &lt; filename &gt; "" searches in standard C library locations whereas ""filename"" searches in the current directory as well. Ideally you would use &lt;...&gt; for standard C libraries and ""..."" for libraries that you write and are present in the current directory. The  syntax. The simple general rule is to use angled brackets to include header files that come with the compiler. Use double quotes to include any other header files. Most compilers do it this way. >. First looks for the presence of header file in the current directory from where directive is invoked. If not found then it searches in the preconfigured list of standard system directories. This looks for the presence of header file in the current directory from where directive is invoked. The exact search directory list depends on the target system how GCC is configured and where it is installed.You can find the search directory list of your GCC compiler by running it with -v option. You can add additional directories to the search path by using - I> which causes dir to be searched after the current directory (for the quote form of the directive) and ahead of the standard system directories.

201,C++ IDE with repl? ,I'm looking for a good C++ IDE with a REPL. The one in visual studio isn't... well lets say most of the time if I copy/paste a line in source the REPL rejects it even if its the line I put a breakpoint or step over. Are there any good IDEs or REPLs for C++?Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter built on the top of LLVM and Clang libraries. Its advantages over the standard interpreters are that it has command line prompt and uses just-in-time (JIT) compiler for compilation. Many of the developers (e.g. Mono in their project called CSharpRepl) of such kind of software applications name them interactive compilers. One of Cling's main goals is to provide contemporary high-performance alternative of the current C++ interpreter in the ROOT project - CINT. The backward-compatibility with CINT is major priority during the development.  CLing should be independant of Clang and abble to compile on any platform recent works of CERN tend to separate Cling from Clang and it's good trends. What I don't under is mostly the existence of Clipp in C++ allowing to parse javascript embedded in my C++ code and can't find a version of Clipp for just C++ / Boost / Eigen / Quantlib. Another thing I don't understand is why TinyCC with a 200ko size is abble to parse windows.h without a problem and LLVM team complaining about Clang on windows.H detonate on tarmac. All in all with fusion spirit wave and the so many people wishing for a C++ REPL why after 2 decade there is not even small version of it. Here is my solutions Forget about REPL C++ and stick to REPL C use tinyCC and expose only the functionnal action of method by using pointer function A.function(toto t) -&gt; function(A * toto t). To make it works with object method you can also use declaration as struct __declspec(novtable) A { }; This will allow binary align compatibility between tinyCC struct understanding and your true object. True you will have to split the tuple of data and the tuple of method but after all that should have always be the case in first place. Object design should have split data and method into a dual model rather than a mixed model good for bug. In many case the compiler will split the object into dual model anyway. This will provide extrem fast prototyping even for scientist and user of Cling/Cint. Second solution rather than REPL statement use the dynamic load/unload pair you setup a chain of compilation ( incremental build or not ) and auto relink compiled library when the source change. It isn't slow at all. This give the advantage to do it on any supported dynamic library OS and it's very EASY to do. Third solution the most easiest way boot a linux based vm ( install llvm tool chain) and use Cling on the vm. That won't work in a firm full windowOSed but it seems LLVM are windows OS haters.

226,jquery - Animation IDE for Javascript ,I was working on some animations today and it appears there is no straightforward Animation IDE for Javascript.  Having a robust IDE for Javascript Animation is crucial to eased development of advanced JS Animations.  With the web evolving you would think that a company like Oracle would develop such a solution.   Does anyone know of any quick and easy methods to Javascript Animation similar to the Flash IDE. Please refer to any applications on the OpenSource Market. Many of our Animation projects could be eased with such a JS Animation IDE tool.Adobe did that. Look at  and click on the second video. The current flash editor (apparently) supports creating HTML5 projects that don't depend on flash at all but are backed up instead by HTML5 canvas/svg and Javascript.
243,Selenium IDE Basic Authentication ,"Im am using Firefox Plugin Selenium IDE for testing (not Webdriver or else). Some areas of my webapplication are only accessible after basic authentication: I found one soulution by myself: Firefox plugin AutoAuth. Typing login and password at first time using ""Save Password"" -function in Firefox the Plugin AutoAuth sends Login-Data automatically if authentication window appears next time. Note: AutoAuth-plugin can´t be used if the login-account has to be changed in context of Selenium-test. To switch users when the site is using basic auth you can specify the username and password in the URL you pass to the open command in the IDE. Viewing the source code in the IDE it could look like this if you want to be first ""user1"" then ""user2""."

310,How to reposition Chrome Developer Tools ,"The tools are opened on the bottom of the chrome window per default. This is a rather bad choice for a wide screen display since there is plenty of empty space to the right but not much vertical space to spare. Unfortunately I have found no way to reposition the tools. I would like to have them on the side similar to firebug.  The only option similar to what I want is to detach the dev tools and place chrome and the tools window side-by-side. This is not very convenient for quickly alt-tabbing from the IDE to the browser and back though so an ""integrated"" solution would be nice.Click the vertical ellipsis button ( ⋮ ) then choose the desired docking option.

394,driver - PCI IDE/(P)ATA differences ,"I've read some articles about PCI and IDE/ATA and I'm a bit confused now. The PCI class 0x01 (mass storage controllers) contains an IDE (0x01) and an ATA (0x05) subclass. However from :  the standard was named ""AT Attachment"" for the IBM PC/AT (which in  turn meant Advanced Technology but ATA is not Advanced Technology  Attachment). But IDE and ATA are synonymous. ATA is a better term. So if they are the same why is there 2 different subclasses for them? Also in this post it is mentioned that  Both types of drives (SATA and PATA) are IDE devices. ...but when I config a Virtual Machine in oracle VM there are different: IDE SATA ect... controllers.  Also this post:  tells that the IDE and PCI are used for different connections but I tought that the ATA 'controllers' are connected to the PCI bus that's why I have to check them there. They are way different... PCI is used for soundcards video card etc...  IDE is used for CD ROMS hard drives floppy drives etc.. In VirtualBox when I attach an IDE floppy controller SCSI or any storage device it appears on the PCI bus just like sound cards and network cards. The more articles I read the more confused I become. It would be good to get some clear description of them.The terms ""IDE"" ""ATA"" and ""PATA"" get used interchangeably.  They generally all refer to a traditional 40/44pin ribbon wire HDD interface.  Note that a PCI or PCI Express IDE/ATA/PATA controller can operate in one of two modes: Legacy Mode - Emulates a legacy ISA bus IDE controller from the original PC.  Uses IRQs 14 and 15.  IRQs cannot be shared/remapped like a normal PCI device.  Only supports a limited number of IDE channels (primary/secondary).  Backwards compatible with every Operating System since the dawn of the PC. Native Mode - Acts like a traditional PCI device.  IRQ number is not fixed and may be shared with other PCI devices.  Supports an arbitrarty number of controllers in the system.  Requires Windows 2000 or later. With the introduction of SATA we have another layer of compatibility.  SATA controllers can typically be configured for one of two modes: IDE Mode - Works like a traditional IDE/ATA/PATA controller.  Allows backwards compatibility with older operating systems (Windows XP and earlier).  Note that in IDE mode you still might have the choice of Legacy vs Native Mode listed above. AHCI Mode - A modern programming interface for SATA controllers.  Natively supported by Windows Vista and later. So a SATA controller can be: To make things confusing some BIOSes will refer to IDE mode as ""Legacy"" and AHCI mode as ""Native"".  Also not all of the modes listed above will necessarily be available for your chipset/BIOS.  Older chipsets may not support AHCI.  Some newer chipsets drop support for the older modes.  Also on a motherboard with several SATA ports there may be a limitation on which ports can be in which mode. Clear as mud?  Great!  Now how does this map to PCI class codes?  Under PCI base class 01h (Mass Storage) there are several sub classes defined in the PCI Spec.  There are three that are relevant to your question. Sub-class 01h = IDE Controller Most IDE/ATA/PATA controllers will use this subclass So will a SATA controller in IDE Mode Both Legacy and Native Mode IDE controller will use this subclass.  You query other bits in the register map to determine which mode you are in. Sub-class 05h = ATA Controller with ADMA This is a special case IDE/ATA controller with special DMA capabilities. I have never seen an Intel or AMD chipset that uses this sub-class. Sub-class 06h = SATA Controller Typically this means a SATA controller in AHCI mode. However some early SATA controllers had a proprietary interface. The Programming Interface register will tell you what mode it is in. As for Oracle VM it probably gives you a choice of which mode the ""virtual"" HDD is presented to the guest Operating System.  I do not have a copy in front of me though.  Just glancing at the documentation it looks like there are choices for IDE (not clear if Native/Legacy/AHCI) or SCSI."
