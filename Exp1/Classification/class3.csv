10,Eclipse IDE for Java - Full Dark Theme ,"Is there any way to completely turn Eclipse to a dark IDE?Here's a  (Which I have changed a little bit) my Eclipse looks like the picture below:Moonrise is the best dark theme I have ever seen for Eclipse!Just follow the steps on the website and Enjoy! : Dark theme works well with Eclipse 4.5 onward with Windows 10.  No more black text on black background  Update June 2014: As mentioned din "" mentions: A new dark window theme has been introduced. This popular community theme demonstrates the power of the underlying Eclipse 4 styling engine..  Plug-ins can contribute extensions to this theme to style their own specific views and editors to match the window theme.  Update April 2013: It seems the solution below don't work well with Eclipse Juno 4.2 and Windows 8 according to  mentions: .  That can be done with the Eclipse Colour Theme plugin () although you get a fine set of dark themes with the default plugin install and may not need to come back to their website for any more. Get the plugin here. .  This plugin gives you a GUI editor for the chrome colour scheme: .  If you want a dark one go ahead and click away until eclipse is dark. Once you are done some GUI surface area will show through the system theme as mentioned at the top of this post.  Rather than using that editor you could install the pre-baked Dark Juno theme instead.  The install is manual.  Start by downloading it from here: .  It has to be copied into your eclipse dropins folder. This lives next to the eclipse executable not in your workspace or someplace like that. In my case the command to do the copy was: You could be running eclipse from any directory though so which eclipse will tell you where it should go.  Restart eclipse and you should find a Dark Juno option under . It is a nice neutral grey with some gradients and is a very good option. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Update December 2012 (20 months later): The blog post ""  It proves that again the concise codes and advanced features could be achieved by contributing or extending with the external form(like library framework).  New language is not necessary just for this kind of purpose. Update July 2012 (15 months later): I have seen one!

There is also an .epf File for the Chrome Theme plugin preferences you should import.You can get it from my dropbox:   In the end your eclipse will look like this:I've build a win 7 dark theme base on the popular windows 7 'concave 7' theme for eclipse dark juno theme.And I also create a dark theme inspired from the editor color theme 'Zenburn' created by Janni Nurmin Here are photos of this theme: All settings of this theme is available on github: (I use guari and retta and I think that looks real good :)  I hope that it will  help someone :) Darkest Dark is the best dark theme.It also comes with different toolbar icon shapes.

43,Query IDE for MongoDB? ,"I'm wondering if there is an IDE for MongoDB that allows you to run queries and see the results? This would behave like query analyzer in SQL Server Management Studio. The issue I'm having right now is that I have to do queries such as ""db.MyTable.find()"" from command prompt which isn't a good solution.  If the answer is no is there a more mature ""no sql"" solution like MongoDB that does have an IDE? By far the best UI (for Windows) currently out there  is MongoVUE. Robo 3T (formerly Robomongo) give you a shell like interface but outputs your results in the gui.Its available for windows mac(dmg zip) and linux (deb rpm tar.gz) as a desktop application. Currently there is a free community version (no ads all features) and payed ones with more support and influence on backlog. Robo 3T (formerly Robomongo) prints the results in a treeView or Json text representation and supports the generation of UUID (.NET-Python-Java-Encoding). It has autocomplete shows multiple results at once and has a query history. "
