4,Rename package in Android Studio ,"How do you rename packages in the new IDE Android Studio based on IntelliJ IDEA? Is there an automatic refactoring included?  I want to make bulk refactoring but I don't know how. I worked two years with Eclipse and in Eclipse it's a one-click operation.For example if you want to change  attribute in your manifest. Clean and Rebuild.  (which is now independent of the package name) can be done very easily in one step. You don't have to touch AndroidManifest.Instead do the following:  Note this will > change the package name. The decoupling of Package Name and Application ID is explained here: The approach used by me for renaming the package name is simple as follows:- : Select the Project option from left menu of Android Studio  : Right click on java and add a new package and set the desired package name  : Enter you new packagename  :Copy all the files from your old package and paste in the new package  :Rename the package name in manifest file  :Rename the package name in build.gradle file  :Then right click the old package and delete it with all its data and delete that directory as well  :Then Rebuild your project  :Then you will find some errors of old import packagename in your project :Then a popup appears like below and select All files option from it  :Rebuild your project again bingo your project packagename has been changed :) Place your cursor in the package name like shown below. Don't select it just place it.  Then press  you will get a popup window as shown below select.(Note since my cursor is on ""something"" only something is renamed.) That's it done. Right-click on the package at the  If your package name is more than two dot separated say  you might DO the following steps to refactoring your package name(s) in Android Studio or IntelliJ: then refactor them by moving them to com and com.hello respectively.   You will see com and com.hello sitting there at the Project(   or  for shortcut) and rename directories refactoring is   waiting there as you expected. Refactor to rename one or more of these directories to reach your aim. The only thing you should notice here is you must choose the directories rather than Packages when a dialog ask you. If you've got lots of classes in your project it will take you a while to wait for its auto-scan-and-rename. Besides you need to rename the package name inside the AndroidManifest.xml manually I guess such that other names in this file can benefit the prefix.  and then insert the desired package name. 2- Open  to the desired package  name. Select option  Uncheck the Compact Empty Middle Packages option. Renaming directory crl to crl1 Finally click on Do Refactor button marked in image belowenter code here After Changes done Please try the following steps: *******Finally itâ€™s done ******   Press  has always worked for me.Simply . It should be fine from here. The best way is to write the new package name and drag from the older package name. The second way if you click > then move option then rename the package name it will rename the package name and then rebuild. In Build.gradle you have to do manually if you Refactor then it will not rename in Build.gradle. I recommend to use the  Done!"
15,How do you split and unsplit a window/view in Eclipse IDE? ,How do you split a window/view in Eclipse IDE? I want to edit code while viewing the different code in the same file. If there is a trick to open the same file twice this might do but I would rather just split the one current view instead of having two of the same which might get confusing.This is possible with the menu items . That works on Eclipse Juno or higher.For the previous Eclipse versions check  out Simply go to Window &gt; New Window This will open up a new window of the same Workspace in eclipse.  You can open up separate files in each Window. Below are the steps to  editor horizontally or verticallygo to:  to split editor horizontally or to split editor vertically. It will open two editors side by side or will pileup tow. If you want to see two different files in same eclipse you can Right-click a tab -&gt;  to tabs again.
16,java - How to increase IDE memory limit in IntelliJ IDEA on Mac? ,"I'm using IDEA 12 Leda on Mountain Lion. I wanted to increase the maximum memory that IDE can use. I set the VMOptions in Info.plist file to be come from? I need to remove it.Since IDEA 15.0.4 you can use  is no longer recommended as the signature will not match and you will get issues depending on your system security settings (app will either not run or firewall will complain on every start or the app will not be able to use the system keystore to save passwords). As a result of addressing  a new way to supply JVM options was introduced in IDEA 12: Now it can take VM options from   and system properties  from  setting.  As for the intellij2018 version I am using the following configuration for better performance go to that path ""C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA 12.1.4\bin\idea.exe.vmoptions"" and change size to -Xmx512m hope its will work OSX 10.9 if you dont bother about signed application you might just change It looks like IDEA solves this for you (like everything else).  When loading a large project and letting it thrash it will open a dialog to up the memory settings.  Entering 2048 for Xmx and clicking ""Shutdown"" then restarting IDEA makes IDEA start up with more memory.  This seems to work well for Mac OS though it never seems to persist for me on Windows (not sure about IDEA 12). On my machine this only works in  causes the IDEA to hang during startup. Some addition to the top answer here "
26,IDE for JavaScript development ,What do you suggest for JS development IDE. Is there something similar to VisualStudio IDE so I can run/debug my application in it?A few options: At JetBrains we've just developed lightweight  that includes very smart JavaScript Editor with DOM-based autocompletion and HTML5 API support.It allows you to debug(breakpoints supported) and run your scripts directly from IDE. I think IntellJ's JavaScript support is excellent just like everything else that they do.  Standalone or as a Eclipse plugin. The Pro version has some nice addons like the embedded IE (to the always embedded Firefox) and debugging support for both browsers.I found after hours of testing that Suns  is the best PHP and Python IDE for Windows and Linux. I was surprised that also Javascript support can hold the candle to Aptana. So Netbeans is my recommendation (not only for Javascript). Give it a try its free!  I've found  Eclipse and JSEclipse plugin and of course Firefox + Firebug the ultimate duo. You'll find this development setup satisfactory. Aptana is a great IDE as it will provide intelli-sense for CSS javascript html java etc.  The debugger gives you the choice to run in FF or IE and is a full featured debugger.  The community edition allows you to run a server side javascript as well.  A very solid and feature rich platform for free.
29,c++ - What does int argc char *argv[] mean? ,In many C++ IDE's and compilers when it generates the main function for you it looks like this: When I code C++ without an IDE just with a command line compiler I type: without any parameters.  What does this mean and is it vital to my program? syntax): If you declared your main as . There is almost always a better solution implemented through C libraries. Both of are legal definitions of the entry point for a C or C++ program.  details some of the variations that are possible or legal for your main function.
31,Good IDE for Elixir ,I am looking for an IDE that does atleast some of the following It would be nice if it could alsoThere is a a good sublime integration called  extension. This extension adds rich elixir language support to VS Code including:  elixir-tmbundle is great and highly lightweight package available for Sublime text support of Elixir Lang you can simply add it to sublime text by simply running. There is TextMate support for this package as well you can follow this link for more info. 
32,Eclipse/Java code completion not working ,"I've downloaded unzipped and setup Eclipse 3.4.2 with some plugins (noteable EPIC Clearcase QuantumDB MisterQ).  Now I find when I'm editing Java projects the code completion is not working.  If I type  and press Try  in '' An example of the kind of data you see in this preference screen however not necessarily what you currently have. if have duplicate Mylyn entries uncheck the duplicate entries that do not contain ""  Then in the : as suggested by @nhahtdh's comment adding the some more info to answer directly: IBus plugin in Xfce uses by default I faced this problem and spent hours trying to figure out the issue. tried to follow the steps mentioned in the different answers above the solution I found is on the same lines as Mona suggested but slightly different. Tried to add as a comment to Mona's answer but no option was available.Issue with my eclipse was classpath somehow got corrupted and all the jars and dependent projects were missing. after taking the latest .classpath from repository it worked fine. I had this problem and like @Marc only on a particular class.  I discovered that I needed to designate Open With = Java Editor.  As a Eclipse newbie I hadn't even realized that I was just using a plain editor. In the package explorer right-click the file and chose ""Open With"".  I also face this issue but it is resolved in different way.Steps that I follow may be helpful for others. Once you have you configuration checked and completion is still not working: Do you see the right icon beside the file?: response but the add comment only works after I have a rating of 50? not sure WTF that is... ThanksTom For me the issue was a conflict between several versions of the same library. The Eclipse assist was using an older version than maven.  I had to go to the .m2 directory and delete the unwanted lib version + restart eclipse. I experience problems on Eclipse Neon when . When I copy the same file to the project root directory not even to the src directory the completion starts working. When the file is opened from a different directory only completion for JRE works. That is for example:  does not. Just in case anyone got to a desperate point where nothing works... It happened to us that the content assist somehow shrunk so no suggestion was shown just the ""Press Ctrl+Space for non-Java..."" could be seen.So it was just a matter of dragging the corner of the content assist to enlarge the pop-up. I know embarrassing. Hope it helps. Note: this was an Ubuntu server with Xfce4 using Eclipse Oxygen.  eclipse version so I assume the auto-complete feature does not migrated correctly during the upgrade process. The only solution that worked for me was to create a new eclipse workspace and import the project/s to it. It might take a few minutes but it worth it - comparing to the time spent on other solutions... "
37,Changing API level Android Studio ,"I want to change the minimum SDK version in Android Studio from API 12 to API 14. I have tried changing it in the manifest file i.e. and rebuilding the project but I still get the Android Studio IDE throwing up some errors. I presume I have to set the min SDK in 'project properties' or something similar so the IDE recognizes the change but I can't find where this is done in Android Studio.When you want to update your minSdkVersion in an existent project... An example of build.gradle: For beginners in Android Studio ""Sync gradle button"" is located in  Tools -&gt; Android -&gt; Sync Project with Gradle Files ""Rebuild project""  Build -&gt; Rebuild Project  Though this question was already answered but Android Studio has changed a little bit by its stable release. So an easy straight forward way will help any new answer seeker landing here. In android studio you can easily press:  You can also change the  For the latest Android Studio v2.3.3 (October 11th 2017) : 1. Click  on menu bar  2. Click Open Module Settings  3. Open  tab  4.

In Android studio open build.gradle and edit the following section: here you can change minSdkVersion from 12 to 14 Changing the minSdkVersion in the manifest is not necessary. If you change it in the gradle build file as seen below you accomplish what you need to do.  For me what worked was: (right click)project-&gt;android tools-&gt;clear lint markers. Although for some reason the Manifest reverted to the old (lower) minimum API level but after I changed it back to the new (higher) API level there was no red error underline and the project now uses the new minimum API level. Edit: Sorry I see you were using Android Studio not Eclipse. But I guess there is a similar 'clear lint markers' in Studio somewhere and it might solve the problem.

47,What's a good IDE for Erlang programming? ,"As far as I know there's Erlang plugin for NetBeans and Eclipse. Which one has the upper hand at the moment?  Are there any other IDE for Erlang which I didnt mention and how good are they when compare with NetBeans and Eclipse? The best IDE for Erlang is Emacs. However the mode which ships with Erlang isn't the best. ). Pros:Syntax highlight autocompletion and suggestion all work well.During suggest it will display some documentationif available: very useful when exploring a module. Error and warning annotiations are quick and helpful. All things considered the user experience is good especially if you are used to eclipse. Cons:Erlide can also run your modules but I find the shell is too clunky to be usable. I always keep a ""real"" erlang shell open and compile/test my code from there. There is also a Textmate bundle (google) but I have not tried that yet. Erlang mode in Emacs is the generally recommended IDE.  and Vimthey are good enough for developing.Geany can also compile and run the code. . I'm using sublime text on windows mac and linux Emacs or VIM is not a good choice if you didn't have experience on them.There a too many bugs in Eclipse...And IntelliJ IDEA is the best IDE"
48,Inefficient jQuery usage warnings in PHPStorm IDE ,I recently upgraded my version of PHPStorm IDE and it now warns me about inefficient jQuery usage. For example: Prompts this warning: Checks that jQuery selectors are used in an efficient way. It suggests  to split descendant selectors which are prefaced with ID selector and  warns about duplicated selectors which could be cached. So my question is: Why is this inefficient and what is the efficient way to do the above selector? I'd guess at: Is this the right way?I had the same question today and was able to find a solution thanks to  There was some discussion about this on jQuery forums but its 3 years old:As they point out here if you are doing a lot of operations on same id selector the greatest performance improvement is found by caching the top level element.On the other hand if you are doing just a few selections there is going to be virtually no performance difference. Therefor I believe that IntelliJ is overstating the importance of this code style.  The first question is to hit Alt+Enter and select the first tip in the list then hit Enter you'll see what it thinks the most efficient way.
52,Choosing an IDE/Editor for Clojure coding ,"I'm looking for an editor or an IDE for my Clojure coding and I found this thread: However I have a couple of questions:Which IDE offers the best Clojure environment (right now): IntelliJ Eclipse or NetBeans?What are the advantages of Aquamacs (I read Rick is using it) over the previous heavy-weight IDEs?I have spent significant chunks of time (on a Mac) with: My opinions on those: > - The Eclipse editor is coming along and the structural editing has some of the niceties of paredit (but not the truly essential slurp barf splice capability).  The Eclipse repl is just a stock command-line repl and is pretty bad in comparison to NetBeans.  However the NetBeans remote repl has been broken out into an independent project and is coming very soon to Eclipse which will make Eclipse even more attractive.  Maven integration is very good.  I use Eclipse now when I want to see lots of files and projects at once which I have a hard time doing in Emacs. At the moment my bet is that the Eclipse tooling will start to pull away from the others.  But I'm still hoping for a Clojure-specific IDE to show up. :)      The world has changed a lot since I first wrote this. There are now at least 6 very good Clojure environments. If you have not allegiance to a pre-existing editor and want an easy place to start there are two great choices: 1)  There you can see most of the keyboard shortcuts. Sublime Text with Paredit and SublimeREPL is a quite a good option. Sublime Text is a powerful and light weight editor. It enjoys a big umbrella of plugins. Agree with Alex. I have tried NetBeansEmacs Textmate and Eclipse on OSX. For now Eclipse is a better choice. BTW it also depends on your background. If you are a Java programmer Eclipse is a very good choice. Sometimes I use the REPL - for example to try out Clojure 1.3 Alpha3.We do need a Clojure-specific IDE; something like Komodo. There is a new Clojure plugin for Intellij called .   Unfortunately it looks like . Make sure you can get emacs.app for mac.  According to the writer:""The reason I recommend Emacs is that it offers tight integration with a Clojure REPL which allows you to instantly try out your code as you write. That kind of tight feedback loop will be useful while learning Clojure and later when writing real Clojure programs. Emacs is also great for working with any Lisp dialect; in fact Emacs is written in a Lisp dialect called Emacs Lisp (elisp).""."
54,php - PHPDoc type hinting for array of objects? ,"So in PHPDoc one can specify  doesn't seem to be valid for example. The best you can do is say I do that a lot in Zend Studio. Don't know about other editors but it ought to work. In the PhpStorm IDE from JetBrains you can use  is not necessary. . I prefer to read and write clean code - as outlined in ""Clean Code"" by Robert C. Martin.When following his credo you should not require the developer (as user of your API) to know the (internal) structure of your array.  The API user may ask: Is that an array with one dimension only? Are the objects spread around on all levels of a multi dimensional array? How many nested loops (foreach etc.) do i need to access all objects? What type of objects are ""stored"" in that array? As you outlined you want to use that array (which contains objects) as a one dimensional array.  As outlined by Nishi you can use: for that.  But again: be aware - this is not a standard docblock notation. This notation was introduced by some IDE producers.  Okay okay as a developer you know that ""[]"" is tied to an array in PHP. But what do a ""something[]"" mean in normal PHP context? ""[]"" means: create new element within ""something"". The new element could be everything. But what you want to express is: array of objects with the same type and itÂ´s exact type. As you can see the IDE producer introduces a new context. A new context you had to learn. A new context other PHP developers had to learn (to understand your docblocks). Bad style (!). Because your array do have one dimension you maybe want to call that ""array of objects"" a ""list"". Be aware that ""list"" has a very special meaning in other programming languages. It would be mutch better to call it ""collection"" for example. Remember: you use a programming language that enables you all options of OOP.Use a class instead of an array and make your class traversable like an array. E.g.: Or if you want to store the internal objects on different levels within an multi dimensional array/object structure: This solution replaces your array by an object of type ""orderCollection"" but do not enable code completion within your IDE so far. Okay. Next step: Implement the methods that are introduced by the interface with docblocks - particular:  Do not forget to use type hinting for: This solution stops introducing a lot of: all over your code files (e.g. within loops) as Zahymaka confirmed with her/his answer. Your API user is not forced to introduce that docblocks to have code completion. To have @return on only one place reduces the redundancy (@var) as mutch as possible. Sprinkle ""docBlocks with @var"" would make your code worst readable. Finaly you are done. Looks hard to achive? Looks like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Not realy since you are familiar with that interfaces and with clean code. Remember: your source code is written once / read many. If code completion of your IDE do not work with this approach switch to a better one (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA PhpStorm Netbeans) or file a feature request on the issue tracker of your IDE producer. Thanks to Christian Weiss (from Germany) for being my trainer and for teaching me such a great stuff. PS: Meet me and him on XING.  Now usage of classes: Once again: I suspect not all IDE support it but PhpStorm does. Try yours post in comment the results! I know I'm late to the party but I've been working on this problem recently.  I hope someone sees this because the accepted answer although correct is > the best way you can do this.  Not in PHPStorm at least I haven't tested NetBeans though. The best way involves extending the ArrayIterator class rather than using native array types.  This allows you to type hint at a class-level rather than at an instance-level meaning you only have to PHPDoc once not throughout your code (which is not only messy and violates DRY but can also be problematic when it comes to refactoring - PHPStorm has a habit of missing PHPDoc when refactoring) See code below: The key here is the PHPDoc  to signify ""an array of Foo's"" but it's not supported by IDE's. I've found something which is working it can save lives !"
55,Does Google Chrome work with Selenium IDE (as Firefox does)? ,I can't find an equivalent of Selenium IDE that works with Chrome. Does anyone know the way to use Selenium IDE works with Chrome instead of Firefox? Or is there any alternative tool which can work with Chrome?artejera do you mean Selenium as plugin to your browser (Selenium IDE)?Here is . Katalon Studio is a free Selenium IDE alternative. Our team has used it before and it has some advantages over Selenium IDE: Whatever tool you choose there are some criteria you should pay attention to: you can use Google chrome extensions like imacros scirocco on chrome 21 or later versions. they are similar to selenium IDE for Firefox. Scirocco seems to be new with some limitations like navigation is not supported. So I recommend 'imacros' seems very close to selenium. If you want to harness Selenium IDE record &amp; playback capabilities for Chrome browser there is an equivalent extension for Chrome called Scirocco.You can add it to Chrome by visiting here using your Chrome browser 
56,clang-based cross-platform C++ IDE? ,The  C++ compiler claims to be built for among other things better IDE integration by providing an API for the IDE to use for tasks such as parsing the code. So are there are any good C++ IDE's that use clang to provide features such as semantic highlighting refactoring and finding and showing semantic errors in real-time? I've been using Eclipse CDT but its C++ parser is full of imperfections that cause the IDE to report a lot of annoying false positive errors in the code. I would like to have an IDE that reports an error if and only if the compiler would report the same error hence my interest in an IDE that's built on a compiler's internals. I'm primarily interested in cross-platform IDE's although I wouldn't mind knowing about single-platform ones for Windows or Linux (so  Xcode).Qt Creator is basing their next-gen code parsing and associated functionality on Clang:  Clearly advertises libclang backend as a main feature.

77,intellij idea - Managing keyboard shortcut conflicts between IDE and OS (Ubuntu) ,"I'm using IntelliJ IDEA but I think this applies to any IDE. In IDEA some  conflict with Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts. Some examples: I've been using Ubuntu for a long time and I'm used to these shortcuts. I use them all the time to switch between workspaces lock my session... At the same time I know how useful the IntelliJ shortcuts can be and I want to avoid using the mouse as much as possible. Currently my workaround for ""format source code"" is I use Ubuntu as well and I disabled the native (Ubuntu) command  to format the code and  for navigating backward Hope this helps This works for me in Ubuntu Studio 14.04 (XFCE): In order to disable XUbuntu's (xfce) keymap for  and I used .  Here I was able to clear these mappings. From the link to feature request provided by CrazyCoder: Actually there are several bundled schemes: ""Default for GNOME"" ""Default for KDE"" created exactly for that purpose.  I have not checked now particular shortcuts like Ctrl+Alt+L but these schemes were created to avoid conflicts with GNOME and KDE respectively. ""Default for Gnome"" did the trick for me (I'm on ArchLinux Gnome3 AndroidStudio/InteliJ) it remapped Navigate/Back to Shift+Alt+Left (was Ctrl+Alt+Left from ""Default for XWin"" and it didn't work). But now it switches may keyboard layout as well (Shift+Alt) another problem )) Probably I'll remap keypad switcher to something else it is still simpler then reassigning all the conflicting keys in IDE/OS. In 'Settings' section 'Keymap' you can choose the keymaps template from XWin Gnome Visual Studio Eclipse etc... This solve any problem in Ubuntu by choosing Gnome."
