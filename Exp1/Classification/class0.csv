This is especially useful if you have build files or logs or other temporary files that are part of your projects directory structure but you only want to search amongst the source code. You should also be aware of that files/directories matched for exclusion in the Resource Filters will not show up in the Package Explorer either so you might not always want this.

So what is this > that everyone knows but me? Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors. See  file. Linting is a process by a linter program that analyzes source code in a particular programming language and flag potential problems like syntax errors deviations from a prescribed coding style or using constructs known to be unsafe.  For example a JavaScript linter would flag the first use of parseInt below as unsafe:"

It supports large code-bases well without slowing down or spending all its time indexing. (This is a problem I had with eclipse's cdt).  Slickedit's speed is probably the nicest thing about it actually.The code completion works well and there are a large amount of options for things like automatic formatting beautification and refactoring.It does have integrated debugging.It has plug-in support and fairly active community creating them.In theory you should be able to integrate well with people doing the traditional makefile stuff as it allows you to create a project directly from one but that didn't work as smoothly as I would have liked when I tried it.In addition to Linux there are Mac and Windows versions of it should you need them.It's been a month since I started using Vim as my main 'GUI'tool for programming C++ in Linux.

I'm also > closing this question so people can stillreact or maybe even add new suggestions or additions to thealready really nice answers... I recommend you read :   If you like Eclipse for Java I suggest Eclipse CDT. Despite C/C++ support isn't so powerful as is for Java it still offers most of the features. It has a nice feature named Managed Project that makes working with C/C++ projects easier if you don't have experience with Makefiles. But you can still use Makefiles.I do C and Java coding and I'm really happy with CDT. I'm developing the firmware for a embedded device in C and a application in Java that talks to this device and is really nice to  use the same environment for both. I guess it probably makes me more productive. I love how people completely miss the request in the original question for an IDE.  Linux is NOT an IDE.  That's just not what those words mean.  I learned c and c++ using vi and gcc and make and I'm not saying they aren't adequate tools but they are NOT an IDE.  Even if you use more elaborate tools like vim or emacs or whatever fancy editor you want typing commands on a command line is not an IDE. Also you all know make exists as part of visual studio right?  The idea that an IDE is ""limiting"" is just silly if you can use the IDE to speed some things yet are still able to fall back on command line stuff when needed. All that said I'd suggest as several above have trying Code blocks.  Its got decent code highlighting a pretty effortless way to create a project code it run it etc that is the core of a real IDE and seems fairly stable.  Debugging sucks...I have never seen a decent interactive debugger in any linux/unix variant.  gdb ain't it.  If you're used to visual studio style debugging you're pretty much out of luck. Anyway I'll go pack my things I know the one-view-only linux crowd will shout this down and run me out of town in no time. make + vim + gdb = one great IDE I quite like  for Eclipse could fill your needs? The Linux Tools project aims to bring a full-featured C and C++ IDE to Linux developers. We build on the source editing and debugging features of the CDT and integrate popular native development tools such as the GNU Autotools Valgrind OProfile RPM SystemTap GCov GProf LTTng etc. Current projects include LTTng trace viewers and analyzers an RPM .spec editor Autotools build integration a Valgrind heap usage analysis tool and OProfile call profiling tools. On Linux there are plenty of IDEs:  In > experience the most valuable are .Both provide all ""standard"" features (i.e. autocompletion syntax highlightning debugger git integration).It is worth noting that Eclipse also provides refactoring functionalities while Qt Creator provides integration with Valgrind and support for deployment on remote targets.

And then I noticed that this simply isn't how you work there* and I threw everything out spent a few days reading manuals set up my shell (bash) set up a GVIM environment learned the GCC/binutils toolchain make and gdb and lived happily ever after. I'd mostly agree but the problem is also one of perception: we forget how difficult it was to become productive in any chose IDE (or other environment).  I find IDE's (Visual Studio NetBeans Eclipse) amazingly cumbersome in so many ways. As an old-time UNIX guy I always use Emacs. But that has a pretty steep   and long learning curve so I'm not sure I can recommend it to newcomers. I'd second that; use Emacs as my primary editor on both Linux and on MSW (XP2W2K).I would disagree that it has a > delays many seconds before refreshing files from disk.

14,eclipse - What is the best IDE to develop Android apps in? ,I am about to start developing an android app and need to get an IDE. Eclipse and the android eclipse plugin appears to be the natural choice. However I am familiar with intelliJ and re-sharper so I would prefer use intelliJ.  Has anyone used ? Is this any good? Should I just bite the bullet and learn Eclipse? IntelliJ now has support for Android. See  is the best option for android. i have used both eclipse and intellij and found intellij is much easier to use with android as compared to eclipse because of these reasons :- Intellij provides a built-in support for android and you don't have to configure it as you need to do with eclipse.Intellij gives you auto-lookup feature which is really important for developer like us to increase our productivity. And if we talk about eclipse you have to type each and every method classname etc on your own. (May be eclipse has this feature too but i never found it and trust me i tried to find it like anything)Its much more user friendly and easy to use than eclipse.I hope it will help you and other members of stack overflow to decide which IDE is best for Android development. My personal choice is Intellij. - visual editor. IDEA has one as well but it's rather primitive. I suspect that this feature will soon be deleted as IDEA will improve its editor.- many projects into one right pane (this is also my personal con as I like IDEA's one-project-per-pane thing)- faster compiles Android projects. IDEA has made its compilation process faster so I also soon expect to delete this Eclipse pro - faster intellisense (if you like Resharper then you know what I am talking about)- smarter autocomplete - my friend and I decided to write the same class. I finished before him simply because IDEA faster reacts to my wishes- incredibly smart - do not know what to do? just press Ctrl+Shift+Space and IDEA will tell you what should come there. It also recognizes naming scheme to if you're filling  method.- will add more as I remember of them   - Still the only con is that if you open Eclipse Android project and edit any XML layout file Eclipse will no longer be able to display edited file into its visual layout editor. This has not been fixed as of this day and it's IDEA's bug as it somehow messes the XML. Bottom line: if you're a person who does not see advantages of ReSharper in .NET (and we all coded in .NET) then you'll probably stick to Eclipse. It's official Android IDE and you believe it's the best.If you liked ReSharper and want to code faster then you'll appreciate IDEA and will stick to it forever.  An IDE which supports Android development is  - great for anyone familiar with Basic  Eclipse and Netbeans are both horrible slow and I'ts a miracle that even the serious developers has been sticking with it for years not even try to stick with a better product. Java as platform is a shame when it comes to non-handheld platforms (winmaclinux) and if anyone are going to develop on the platform I say do what else but do not use Java at all. For mobility it's probably has a kind of good luck here as the systems are more down-scaled. As far I know there aren't any existing IDE for Java which aren't iself written in a Java environment. This is horrible because Java is messing up the desktop  environment.  I'm willing to spend hours on google to find an Java IDE/Editor which are capable for android projects but will use a native environment for itself. I Feel Eclipse IDE is more suitable for android applications rather than other IDEs.Because its providing us more than five perspectives which will make our project flexible and ease.You may try Eclipse ides starts with 3.6 and above will provide you better performance.  which are all latest and supports all kind of access. I am a huge supporter of using the environment that is most familiar to you. However this isn't always the best option. In some cases a different environment can result in (far?) greater efficency in the long run. In this particular case I suspect that sticking with what you already know is a good option but someone starting new would benifit from the easy setup and sdk/ndk integration offered by eclipse. I also don't know how available geolocation manipulation (or phone state manipulation - ie incoming call etc) is in other IDE's but integration within eclipse feels seamless.  that i worked with that. you can try it.
15,How do you split and unsplit a window/view in Eclipse IDE? ,How do you split a window/view in Eclipse IDE? I want to edit code while viewing the different code in the same file. If there is a trick to open the same file twice this might do but I would rather just split the one current view instead of having two of the same which might get confusing.This is possible with the menu items . That works on Eclipse Juno or higher.For the previous Eclipse versions check  out Simply go to Window &gt; New Window This will open up a new window of the same Workspace in eclipse.  You can open up separate files in each Window. Below are the steps to  editor horizontally or verticallygo to:  to split editor horizontally or to split editor vertically. It will open two editors side by side or will pileup tow. If you want to see two different files in same eclipse you can Right-click a tab -&gt;  to tabs again.
22,java - 'Must Override a Superclass Method' Errors after importing a project into Eclipse ,"Anytime I have to re-import my projects into Eclipse (if I reinstalled Eclipse or changed the location of the projects)  of my overridden methods are not formatted correctly causing the error: The method must override a superclass method It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects - for whatever reason the method argument values are not always populated so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance: will be initially populated like this: The odd thing is if I remove my code and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method it uses the same argument names I already had so I don't really know where the problem is other then it auto-formatting the method for me. This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it .. I would be very happy. Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods which are inside an argument of another method?Eclipse is defaulting to Java 1.5 and you have classes implementing interface methods (which in Java 1.6 can be annotated with . No idea why but this will solve it. This is my second time encounter this problem.first time according the alphazero's recommendation it worked.but in the second time I set to 1.6 it don't work it just like 'CACHE' this error after clean and rebuild. Try to switch off 'Build Automatically' as Rollin_s said -&gt; error still here! So I removed the problem project (already set to 1.6) from Package Explorer and import it again -&gt; it start a rebuild and no error this time Hope this help someone Fixing  must override a super class method error is not difficult You just need to change Java source version to 1.6 because from Java 1.6 @Override annotation can be used along with interface method. In order to change source version to 1.6 follow below steps : In my case this problem happened when I imported a Maven project into Eclipse. To solve this I added the following in : Then in the context menu of the project go to ""Maven -&gt; Update Project ..."" and press OK. That's it. Hope this helps. In my case none the solutions above works. I have to checkout my source code to another folder. From eclipse select File &gt; Switch workSpaces &gt; Other... and then import code to the new workspaces. it works after that.   This happens when your maven project uses different Compiler Compliance level and Eclipse IDE uses different Compiler Compliance level. In order to fix this we need to change the Compiler Compliance level of Maven project to the level IDE uses. 1) To See Java Compiler Compliance level uses in Eclipse IDE  *) Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Compiler Compliance level : 1.8 (or 1.7 1.6  ect)  2) To Change Java Compiler Compliance level of Maven project *) Go to  ""Project"" -&gt;  ""Properties"" -&gt; Select ""Java Compiler"" -&gt; Change the Compiler Compliance level : 1.8 (or 1.7 1.6  ect)  "
24,What Ruby IDE do you prefer? ,I've been using Eclipse with RDT (not RadRails) a lot lately and I'm quite happy with it but I'm wondering if you guys know any decent alternatives. I know NetBeans also supports Ruby these days but I'm not sure what it has to offer over Eclipse. Please list any features you think are brilliant or useful when suggesting an IDE makes it easier to compare. Also I said Ruby not Rails. While Rails support is a plus I prefer things to be none Rails-centric. It should also be available on Linux and optionally Solaris.Have you tried . Once I found Geany (Ubuntu) I switched from TextMate (OSX) and never looked back. Geany is a lean clean speedy IDE that can be used either as a text editor or a light-weight IDE. It supports not only text editing features (syntax highlighting code folding auto-completion auto-closing symbol lists code navigation directory tree multi-tabbed open files etc.) but also normal IDE features such as simple project management compile-build-run within the main window. Unlike TextMate it has a Terminal screen within its own window; you do not have to go back and force between your editor window and terminal window. Unlike TextMate it supports international languages. Unlike TextMate it supports multi-platforms Unlike TextMate it is open-source and free. Geany is now my favorite C/Ruby/XML development tool.   RubyMine is so awesome. Everything just works. I could go on and on. Code completion is fast smooth and accurate. Formatting is instantaneous. Project navigation is easy and without struggle. You can pop open any file with a few keystrokes. You don't even need to keep the project tree open but it's there if you want. You can configure just about any aspect of it to behave exactly how you want. NetBeans Eclipse and RubyMine all have more or less the same set of features. However RubyMine is just so much more cleanly designed and easy to use. There's nothing awkward or clunky about it. There are all these nice little design touches that show how JetBrains really put thought into it instead of just amassing a big pile of features. Incidentally RubyMine can do a lot of the things that Vim can do like select and edit a column of text or split the view into several editing panels with different files in them. 
25,LLVM C++ IDE for Windows ,Is there some C/C++ IDE for Windows which is  (merged from answers):LLVM is supported in  as far as I know. I am the main author of the plug-in so you can ask any questions related to it. The plug-in offers the basic functionality for Clang and llvm-gcc compilation and support Linux and Windows (w/ Cygwin &amp; MiNGW). LLVM tools such as assembler archiver linker and static compiler (llc) are configured and can be customized via UI. The plug-in offers all the benefits that IDE can offer such as easy configuration and building with one action.  The only drawback is that it is not ready yet as it lacks of some of the advanced features that LLVM can offer such as Clang analyze and smart auto-completion. The plug-in is also not tested well and may not work perfectly therefore I hope I can get user feedback via mailing list found from Google code development site (listed below). I wish I had time to develop it further. I only develop it in my spare time which is very limited. I welcome any developers to participate and contribute to the project. Development site: Eclipse marketplace (100% free &amp; open-source):.It can be downloaded s as of 2018 which is crucial for debugging).
36,java.io.Console support in Eclipse IDE ,"I use the Eclipse IDE to develop compile and run my Java projects. Today I'm trying to use the  when an application is run ""through"" Eclipse. Eclipse run the program on a background process rather than a top-level process with the console window we're familiar with. Is there a way to force Eclipse to run the program as a top level process or at least create a Console that the JVM will recognize? Otherwise I'm forced to jar the project up and run on a command-line environment external to Eclipse.I assume you want to be able to use step-through debugging from Eclipse. You can just run the classes externally by setting the built classes in the bin directories on the JRE classpath. You can debug using the remote debugger and taking advantage of the class files built in your project. In this example the Eclipse project structure looks like this:  So all you have to do any time you want to debug the app is: You can track this issue in  offers alternatives to using System.console(). One is to use a BufferedReader wrapped around System.in the second is to use a Scanner wrapped around System.in.  Neither are as concise as console but both work in eclipse without having to resort to debug silliness! Let's say your Eclipse workspace is C:\MyWorkspace you created your java application inside a maven project MyProject and your Java main class is com.mydomain.mypackage.MyClass. In this case you can run your main class that uses  on the command line: NB1: if it's not in a maven project check the output folder in project properties | Java Build Path | Source. It might not be ""target/classes"" NB2: if it is a maven project but your class is in src/test/java you'll likely have to use ""target\test-classes"" instead of ""target\classes"""
39,java - IDE for Swing ,Is there any IDE that simplifies creating Swing applications (ideally something along the lines of Visual Studio)Like others have mentioned NetBeans' visual editor is pretty good but it's based pretty heavily on the  plugin: which is also based on Eclipse simply adding a few plugins to it as many other commercial products do. It is still not able to parse any Swing code (I doubt any Swing WISIWYG editor does) but if you start with it it gives you relatively seamless experience.You need to pay for it though. At the end of the day I have worked with different similar UI tools Flash Builder Delphi etc. but unless you do some relatively trivial UI design not including much business logic and communication with other layers you'll have to accept that what you are capable of creating in code once you learn to do it properly is much more powerful than what any editor is capable of providing you with. I have switched between several IDEs and the one that I believe has the best GUI builder in terms of use and performance would have to be NetBeans. I have tried a few and the closest I have found that comes close to Visual Studio is NetBeans. Version 6.5 is excellent and really improved over version 5. I'm a big fan of JetBrains and when it comes to Java  Use NetBeans I have also successfully developed one application using NetBeans. It is realy awesome it helps you while writing the code.Since Swing generates some code on its own so it is really helpful to use Netbeans.Go through it and you can always ask question and problems.It will be good if you go for latest version release. I have always coded my UIs by hand. The frustration of dealing with screen builders and filling out all those property sheets is too much for me. After a couple of screens and a little research I am just as productive. As I'm using Eclipse I use the Visual Editor plugin. It generates clean source code with good patterns and easy to patch/modify/extend.Unfortunately it is not very stable. But it's worth trying. I like Eclipse's VisualEditor (VE) and sometime ago I've tried to switch toanother editor but I found it impossible. Visual editor has thisfeature that it generates manageable readable editable and easy-to-understand code. Unlike both mentioned earlier NetBeans editor and WindowBuilder it uses the lazy initialization pattern to separate initialization of components. Also it does not need to lock down parts of code that you can't edit; you may edit code by hand and VE is still able to work with your changes. The only disadvantage of VE is that it uses  is good option and it is free also. As others have mentioned my best experience with Java SWING applications is with NetBeans. NetBeans has a WYSIWYG editor and the code is automatically generated for you which is then protected however you can add custom code to add listeners and other events that the end user may be interested in using such as buttons text forms and areas and other nice GUI tools.
45,Best Fortran IDE ,"Is there anybody using Fortran on stackoverflow? What IDE do you use and which one do you think to be the best? Seems lots of people surround me are quite inconvenient with Intel Visual Fortran. Because there is no support for intellisense refactoring etc.Well as others already mentioned you could use instead of an IDE a separate text editor. Several come to mind;   VIM (or one of the family) - great editing capabilities very customizable. Unfortunatelly it is still an editor not an IDE. It can be customized in a variety of ways of course but that gets boring after a while.  Also it's syntax highlighting capabilities are somewhat wrongly made. Also has some problems/confusions with free/fixed format and f77/f90/f95 ...   Emacs - pretty much same advantages/shortcomings as the above.   In general editors like the above mentioned can be used but in that case it is best to choose one from the start and stick to it; modifying your work habits as you go; since customizing everything can be time consuming to suit your needs. Most editors have problems with fortran's syntax since they're used to C's (where everything that ""opens"" has a ""close""). As far as IDE's goes your options are not that great:   > What about these ones: . I do not like Code::Blocks... We use an in-house extension to visual studio to get code completion for our fortran code and to assist us with debugging. But even so there is a lot of room for improvement. Our main issues are:  We used Sun workshop and it was very good but there is no windows version. jedit has a nice fortran mode and you can define keybindings for the compiler and debugger.for small to medium sized projects it is quite nice. it also has svn and multiple files search. also very nice is hypersearch where you get a list of you matches and you can go to the position with a single click. another goodie is a plugin for gdb and for ctags. you can very easily script all functions using jython. it feels a little bit like a modern version of emacs that uses python instead of lisp. check out the plugin manager. it lets you download all the plugins from the server and installs them for you (like in eclipse).

52,Choosing an IDE/Editor for Clojure coding ,"I'm looking for an editor or an IDE for my Clojure coding and I found this thread: However I have a couple of questions:Which IDE offers the best Clojure environment (right now): IntelliJ Eclipse or NetBeans?What are the advantages of Aquamacs (I read Rick is using it) over the previous heavy-weight IDEs?I have spent significant chunks of time (on a Mac) with: My opinions on those: > - The Eclipse editor is coming along and the structural editing has some of the niceties of paredit (but not the truly essential slurp barf splice capability).  The Eclipse repl is just a stock command-line repl and is pretty bad in comparison to NetBeans.  However the NetBeans remote repl has been broken out into an independent project and is coming very soon to Eclipse which will make Eclipse even more attractive.  Maven integration is very good.  I use Eclipse now when I want to see lots of files and projects at once which I have a hard time doing in Emacs. At the moment my bet is that the Eclipse tooling will start to pull away from the others.  But I'm still hoping for a Clojure-specific IDE to show up. :)      The world has changed a lot since I first wrote this. There are now at least 6 very good Clojure environments. If you have not allegiance to a pre-existing editor and want an easy place to start there are two great choices: 1)  There you can see most of the keyboard shortcuts. Sublime Text with Paredit and SublimeREPL is a quite a good option. Sublime Text is a powerful and light weight editor. It enjoys a big umbrella of plugins. Agree with Alex. I have tried NetBeansEmacs Textmate and Eclipse on OSX. For now Eclipse is a better choice. BTW it also depends on your background. If you are a Java programmer Eclipse is a very good choice. Sometimes I use the REPL - for example to try out Clojure 1.3 Alpha3.We do need a Clojure-specific IDE; something like Komodo. There is a new Clojure plugin for Intellij called .   Unfortunately it looks like . Make sure you can get emacs.app for mac.  According to the writer:""The reason I recommend Emacs is that it offers tight integration with a Clojure REPL which allows you to instantly try out your code as you write. That kind of tight feedback loop will be useful while learning Clojure and later when writing real Clojure programs. Emacs is also great for working with any Lisp dialect; in fact Emacs is written in a Lisp dialect called Emacs Lisp (elisp).""."
53,Scheme IDE for Windows ,What is a good Scheme IDE for Windows? OK I'll admit it; I'm not at RMS's level and don't want to use Emacs or any character-based interface -- I want a graphic IDE with colorization a REPL and usable in-line help for a specific well-documented dialect of Scheme. I have searched around and PLT Scheme/DrScheme seems the best but even that does not look too sophisticated. is an excellenet product well worth taking a look at. It's got all the features you're asking for I think what you want actually is Emacs. Let's see: I've been playing with Xacc.Ide and Iron Scheme and found they were pretty good although they felt not finished in some places. They're good enough for trying out scheme I'm not sure if I'd use them for writing commercial software though. I've seen the author of both of them hang around here so maybe he can tell more.. As far as I know (I used DrScheme for a few months before switching to Emacs) DrScheme has many IDE-like features but they are presented in a simplified interface because of its educational focus. Do some digging and I think you'll be happy what you find. Also I can't resist since I > use Emacs---an OS specific install of emacs is hardly ever character based. I just found out the scheme plugin for eclipse I haven't try it yet.It looks pretty nice.and its git repository I personally use ChezScheme. I run scheme scripts from the console and edit them in eclipse using the SchemeWay plugin. Eclipse is superior to Emacs in my opinion and it has some nice features like automatic indentation and autocomplete for defined names.

Don't know about other editors but it ought to work. In the PhpStorm IDE from JetBrains you can use  is not necessary. . I prefer to read and write clean code - as outlined in ""Clean Code"" by Robert C. Martin.When following his credo you should not require the developer (as user of your API) to know the (internal) structure of your array.  The API user may ask: Is that an array with one dimension only? Are the objects spread around on all levels of a multi dimensional array? How many nested loops (foreach etc.) do i need to access all objects? What type of objects are ""stored"" in that array? As you outlined you want to use that array (which contains objects) as a one dimensional array.  As outlined by Nishi you can use: for that.  But again: be aware - this is not a standard docblock notation. This notation was introduced by some IDE producers.  Okay okay as a developer you know that ""[]"" is tied to an array in PHP. But what do a ""something[]"" mean in normal PHP context? ""[]"" means: create new element within ""something"". The new element could be everything. But what you want to express is: array of objects with the same type and it´s exact type. As you can see the IDE producer introduces a new context. A new context you had to learn. A new context other PHP developers had to learn (to understand your docblocks). Bad style (!). Because your array do have one dimension you maybe want to call that ""array of objects"" a ""list"". Be aware that ""list"" has a very special meaning in other programming languages. It would be mutch better to call it ""collection"" for example. Remember: you use a programming language that enables you all options of OOP.Use a class instead of an array and make your class traversable like an array. E.g.: Or if you want to store the internal objects on different levels within an multi dimensional array/object structure: This solution replaces your array by an object of type ""orderCollection"" but do not enable code completion within your IDE so far. Okay. Next step: Implement the methods that are introduced by the interface with docblocks - particular:  Do not forget to use type hinting for: This solution stops introducing a lot of: all over your code files (e.g. within loops) as Zahymaka confirmed with her/his answer. Your API user is not forced to introduce that docblocks to have code completion. To have @return on only one place reduces the redundancy (@var) as mutch as possible. Sprinkle ""docBlocks with @var"" would make your code worst readable. Finaly you are done. Looks hard to achive? Looks like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Not realy since you are familiar with that interfaces and with clean code. Remember: your source code is written once / read many. If code completion of your IDE do not work with this approach switch to a better one (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA PhpStorm Netbeans) or file a feature request on the issue tracker of your IDE producer. Thanks to Christian Weiss (from Germany) for being my trainer and for teaching me such a great stuff. PS: Meet me and him on XING.  Now usage of classes: Once again: I suspect not all IDE support it but PhpStorm does. Try yours post in comment the results! I know I'm late to the party but I've been working on this problem recently.  I hope someone sees this because the accepted answer although correct is > the best way you can do this.  Not in PHPStorm at least I haven't tested NetBeans though. The best way involves extending the ArrayIterator class rather than using native array types.  This allows you to type hint at a class-level rather than at an instance-level meaning you only have to PHPDoc once not throughout your code (which is not only messy and violates DRY but can also be problematic when it comes to refactoring - PHPStorm has a habit of missing PHPDoc when refactoring) See code below: The key here is the PHPDoc  to signify ""an array of Foo's"" but it's not supported by IDE's.

75,"ide - How do I ""Add Existing Item"" an entire directory structure in Visual Studio? ","I have a free standing set of files not affiliated with any C# project at all that reside in a complicated nested directory structure. I want to add them in that format to a different directory in an ASP.NET web application I am working on; while retaining the same structure. So I copied the folder into the target location of my project and I tried to “add existing  item” only to lose the previous folder hierarchy. Usually I have re-created the directories by hand copied across on a one-to-one basis and then added existing items. There are simply too many directories/items in this case. So how do you add existing directories and files in Visual Studio 2008?Drag the files / folders from Windows Explorer into the Solution Explorer. It will add them all. Note this doesn't work if Visual Studio is in Administrator Mode because Windows Explorer is a User Mode process. Enable > This is what I do: Then everything will be added on your solution from folders to files and files inside those folders. A neat trick I discovered is that if you go to ""Add existing..."" you can drag the folder from the open dialog to your solution. I have my Visual Studio to open in Admin Mode automatically so this was a good workaround for me as I didn't want to have to undo that just to get this to work. There is now an open-source extension in the Marketplace that seems to do what the OP was asking for:  If it doesn't do exactly what you want the code is available so you can modify it to suit your scenario. HTH What worked for me was to drag the folder into Visual Studio then right click the folder and select ""Open Folder in File Explorer"". Then select all and drag them into the folder in Visual Studio. In Windows 7 you could do the following: Right click on your project and select ""Add-&gt;Existing Item"". In the dialog which appears browse to the root of the directory you want to add. In the upper right corner you have a search box. Type  whatever the type of files you want to add. After the search finishes select all files click Add and wait for a while... The cleanest way that I've found to do this is to create a new Class Library project in the target folder and redirect all of its build output elsewhere.  It still leaves a .csproj file sitting in that folder but it does let you see it in Visual Studio and pick which files to include in your project. It's annoying that Visual Studio doesn't support this natively but CMake could generate the Visual Studio project as a work around. Other than that just use Qt Creator. It can then export a Visual Studio project."

87,Recommendations on PHP IDE ,"  I have been a .NET developer for years but may need to work on a PHP project soon. What editor/IDE should I use? ThanksPaulEclipse PDT seems to be a good choice basically it's a ""everything"" rolled package. Netbeans have been more and more supportive of PHP so it might be a good choice too. I'm no PHP expert by any means but went through the same question about 6 months back. .Net developer background deciding to do some PHP work on the side. I ended up using Eclipse for PHP developers which as far as I know is the core Eclipse application with additional plug-ins meant specifically for PHP development. For the most part I'm happy with it. The thing I miss most though is a nice auto-formatter for code the way  does in Visual Studio.  Eclipse does format it but not in a fashion I'm partial towards. Best of luck in your search though I'm sure you'll get plenty of recommendations.  apart from eclipse and netbeans there is geany. its fast and light but has only basic features of an ide."

100,vim - Modal fully fledged IDE ,I am trying to find a good IDE. I always found Vim's modal behaviour interesting but Vim is more of a text editor than an IDE. Even though I have made a few changes to my .vimrc file Vim isn't IDE enough. Any suggestions? FYI: By IDE I mean it's got to have a debugger autocomplete and easy compilation  Edit: I do web development backend node.js python and Ruby on RailsI'd start by listing features you need from your IDE in order of importance.  Think about (random order): Of course you can consider many more features and find them much more important than the ones I listed here. It's totally individual preference since that's you who has to be comfortable.  If you want to use the power of VIM you have basically three options:  Start with vanilla VIM and incrementally add settings and plugins you need. Check out existing configs and adapt them. To make it fully fledged IDE I'd recommend some plugins:  I recommend one of these: or this:  It also depends what your programming environment is. Having autocomplete and compiling from in the vim editor is no problem. Debugging depends but you can also do debugging with other tools and be perfectly fine. Just because other IDEs do it doesn't mean it's the best way. Don't try to get it perfect just from the beginning and don't try to copy every feature your known IDE has. Accept the initial pain and enjoy all those little improvements that you can make every single day. All those improvements will sum up and after a while you will be very proficient. Even years after you still will find ways to improve your workflow. There has been recent development in (at least) those three projects based on nvim extensibility and addressing your very concern: I seems that they are all in early alpha though let's hope the best for them :)

120,Python IDE for teaching? ,I am a student in a year 11 Computer Science class. Previously having taught only Visual Basic my teacher is looking for a language and IDE to teach the class with that is cross-platform and is easy to learn so I suggested Python to him for the language. However he would also like to teach with an IDE with it that includes a form builder in addition to the typical functions of an IDE (editor project management code completion debugging etc.). Having only ever developed with a text editor (usually ) and a relevant compiler I know next to nothing about IDEs and what would be good to use. I've also realised that Python has bindings for a multitude of graphical toolkits of which one is probably chosen for use 'behind-the-scenes' in each IDE's form builder so that is certainly another thing to consider. Could anyone suggest a free open source IDE for Python that would fit my class' needs and would be able to run on Windows Mac OS X and Linux-based operating systems at least? For those who recommend that plain console programming is the best start for beginners I agree! If I were the teacher I'd direct my students straight over to the Python console that is already installed on the computers and start teaching some programming not tainted by the issues of GUI programming. However I would still like to find an IDE for him in case he says that he has to follow the curriculum strictly and needs to teach GUI programming with an IDE/form builder.PyDev is a Python IDE for Eclipse  which may be used in Python Jython  and IronPython development.emacskate - linuxeclipse

129,text editor - Multiple Language IDE ,I've been using Notepad++ for years and although it is comfortable I am feeling the need to move up into the IDE world for various reasons which I'll outline below. I am looking for IDE recommendations for someone who works in multiple languages on a daily basis - I am currently looking at Eclipse and Netbeans but willing to consider any option. The reason I have not made the switch to a full-fledged IDE yet is because they feel so bloated they are slow to load and eat up a ton of memory. Recently I have been working on an astronomical number of projects (5-6 at work upwards of 10 personally) in a variety of languages (Python PHP Ruby Java Javascript xHTML CSS TorqueScript to name a few). These are just the languages I am using on a daily basis - although I don't expect to find an IDE that will meet all the demands of these languages (especially the more obscure TorqueScript on the list). So what would you recommend for someone who needs a fast configurable IDE that offers support for a variety of languages syntax highlighting (preferably with various color schemes) project organization/browsing Intellisense-ish code completion? I forgot to mention I am primarily targetting the Windows environment here - when I'm on my Xubuntu machine (minimally) Geany works fine for what I need to accomplish.I would recommend Eclipse as the closest match for the multi-language requirements. There are IDEs that possibly shine better for a given language (e.g. I prefer IntelliJ for Java) but none that have such a broad coverage of multiple languages. As far as memory/bloat it's a price you pay for the convenience that an IDE provides. The  covers a whole pool of languages and above all that you get a free VM with root access. Definitely worth checking out.

I am interested in all options both commercial and free.Editors worth checking out: All have their specific advantages so just check them out. If you already have Visual Studio I'd suggest you just getting started with this one. I use Visual Studio. It lets you set breakpoints (conditional or otherwise) and establish watches on whatever XPath expression you can come up with. It also supports XSLT right out the box and colours it differently than regular XML so developing in it is very easy. My recommendation is XMLSpy but isn't free - . Hope this helps.

I am using a mac and i'm looking for a IDE(I assume it is an IDE as that is what I use for python) so I can write in JavaScript for study offline and see my results. I have searched google downloaded Aptana Studio 3 and a few other suggestions also I have the latest version of Xcode. Maybe I am just overthinking this or it is my lack of experience but I can not seem to figure  out how to write JavaScript or other specific languages inside one IDE. Sorry if this seems like too straight forward to answer but i'd really like to find an IDE for OSX that is free writes at least html5 css and JavaScript. Yes I have googled that and how to begin writing JavaScript on a mac. Thanks a bunch!an IDE stands for Integrated Development Enviroment so a program that helps you write programs is an IDE an IDE for javascript could be any text editor write your code as regular text save it with .js as extension and add a reference to that file from an html page. I think you can use these free IDE's on mac: Sublime Text and Aptana Studio  I'm sure there's alot more just google it

Or will Perl 5 always be alive?""Best"" is of course a matter of taste. Rather than ""best"" I'll answer this as ""what editor should I use for Perl if I don't already have a strong preference for an editor?"" I went on a short quest to answer this question for my students. What I recommend now is . This is the editor available on any Unix machine and you'll need to use it when you inevitably find yourself needing to edit files on a Unix machine. It is very powerful but also very baffling. Atom has rendered the rest of this answer obsolete. ). I don't know of any of my clients using Perl6 and given this and the extant documentation for Perl5 I would reach for Perl5 with little fear of being overtaken in the near future. You can check EPIC plugin for Eclipse. Far from having all features but you can do some debug and use Eclipse feature quite easily. You can go safely with Perl 5. Perl 6 is a new language still being worked on and its date of release is unknown so you shouldn't care about it for now."
143,Good IDE for HTML ,"I recently started to learn HTML from Code Academy. I have searched around a bit but I have not been able to find a good IDE that closely resembles the one used in the Code Academy course. If anyone has any suggestions please tell me. I'm just looking for an IDE that resembles the one used in the Code Academy course.Most devs I know use Sublime Text me personally I use a variety of tools depending on what I'm working on. Which are good however are as always with this type of question subject to opinion. What's good for me may not suit you where as something I hate may be the perfect tool for you. One bit of advice I will give you though learn to code raw before you go looking for an editor that has all the bells and whistles and does stuff for you. If your just starting out and your learning HTML one of the worst things IMHO that you can do is to use an editor that writes the code for you. I've trained a LOT of developers over the years and by far the ones that always performed the worst where the ones that used automated tools early in their training. If you learn to write code using a very minimalist editor then you'll quickly grow to understand what your writing better rather than thinking ""oh my editor will do this for me and I can look it up later"" For me personally I have no problems logging into a Linux server at the command line and using something like midnight commander to live edit web pages in real time on a live web site :-) If I want the bells and whistles and I'm on windows then Visual Studio is often my tool of choice if I'm on Linux at a desktop then often Net beans. Every application has it's pros and cons the best way to find your perfect tool is to just try a few and see how you feel it's like buying a new pair of shoes unless you try them you'll never know if their going to fit or not. For HTML and such I really like Sublime Text ("
148,open source - Opensource/free HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript IDE? ,What is the best open source/free HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript IDE? Thank you!!!Most of the time when I write code I am programming C# applications using Visual Studio which is my favorite IDE. However when it comes to Javascript VS is quite poor. It does not support collapse to definitions (AKA code folding in other IDEs / editors) does not support code outlining and also has a very primitive and most of the times useless autocomplete. Because of that at some point I have started to search alternative tools for JS programming and the best I came across was . It also has support for HTML and CSS (as well as for some server side languages like Ruby PHP Phyton) but I have only used it for JS and that is an area where it shines. It has very good code outlining and one of the best autocomplete implementations I have ever seen for Javascript (even thought it is still improvable). Aptana Studio is based Eclipse and is available as a plugin or as a full package version. On their site they are saying that the next version is going to totally independent from Eclipse which would make it a lot more light weight and more performant. However the current Beta version of Aptana Studio 3 is still based on Eclipse. You can find more on Aptana Studio 3 on the official page: .This also may help: an extensive  after few years with Aptana... I enjoy using it.
149,What is the best IDE for PHP? ,I'm a PHP developer and now I use  and several others but I'm not really decided they all look nice enough but a bit complicated. I'm sure it'll all get easy once I get used to it but I don't want to waste my time. This is what I'm looking for:Are you sure you're looking for an IDE?  The features you're describing along with the impression of being too complicated that you got from e.g. Aptana suggest that perhaps all you really want is a good editor with syntax highlighting and integration with some common workflow tools.  For this there are tons of options. I've used .He says it here:  would be my second choice. My only problem with Komodo is that the autocomplete is not as good. With properly structured apps where you use phpDoc to document return types etc. it should be alright. But I work on a project that doesn't really do that and Komodo can't read across files to know that $user is a User object for example. Personally everything that is based uppon Eclipse or NetBeans is an overkill the GUI is crap and the performance is soooo slow compared to other alternatives. If you're willing to pay I would suggest Zend IDE (version 5.5 not 6 because it's based on Eclipse) and EditPlus for a more lightweight yet powerfull code editor. If you're looking for free alternatives or if you code in other languages other than PHP OpenKomodo is a really nice IDE with almost all the features (no SVN neither CVS) that you require the only con I see about OpenKomodo is that sometimes it messes my code indentation but then again I don't use it on a very regular basis. As for a free lightweight alternative: Notepad++. =) My personal preference is Eclipse (with various plug-ins) as I am developing in several languages (PHP Java and Ruby) and this way I am always used to interface and keyboard shortcuts. This is not a minor thing as you become very productive this way. I haven't used Aptana but will (hopefully) soon - it does look interesting though.For others IDEs I have used: jEdit (for little Java) Notepad++ (still for some scripting and short test code runs).And for the features You asked: Eclipse support many source code version servers ( is as close to Eclipse java power as it could get. Eclipse PDT is much weaker (last time I checked). I'm using PHPDesigner but I will go for Eclipse PDT. I was always against Eclipse until few months ago when I have one Java project to finish... Great IDE Now I can't imagine one day without Eclipse. :) Have you tried NetBeans 6? Zend Studio and NetBeans 6 are the best IDEs with PHP support you'll come across and NetBeans is free.

I will gladly move to F# VS Express if they ever release one but spending money to just get started with a new language is not in my budget. Visual Studio Shell - Free and F# supports it out of the box. (edited) is a free ide compatible with .net and mono envoriments LinqPad 4.0 has the support for F#. the link this is the description of my company just to show you : >
160,php - PHPDoc type hinting for array of objects? ,"So in PHPDoc one can specify  doesn't seem to be valid for example. The best you can do is say I do that a lot in Zend Studio. Don't know about other editors but it ought to work. In the PhpStorm IDE from JetBrains you can use  is not necessary. . I prefer to read and write clean code - as outlined in ""Clean Code"" by Robert C. Martin.When following his credo you should not require the developer (as user of your API) to know the (internal) structure of your array.  The API user may ask: Is that an array with one dimension only? Are the objects spread around on all levels of a multi dimensional array? How many nested loops (foreach etc.) do i need to access all objects? What type of objects are ""stored"" in that array? As you outlined you want to use that array (which contains objects) as a one dimensional array.  As outlined by Nishi you can use: for that.  But again: be aware - this is not a standard docblock notation. This notation was introduced by some IDE producers.  Okay okay as a developer you know that ""[]"" is tied to an array in PHP. But what do a ""something[]"" mean in normal PHP context? ""[]"" means: create new element within ""something"". The new element could be everything. But what you want to express is: array of objects with the same type and it´s exact type. As you can see the IDE producer introduces a new context. A new context you had to learn. A new context other PHP developers had to learn (to understand your docblocks). Bad style (!). Because your array do have one dimension you maybe want to call that ""array of objects"" a ""list"". Be aware that ""list"" has a very special meaning in other programming languages. It would be mutch better to call it ""collection"" for example. Remember: you use a programming language that enables you all options of OOP.Use a class instead of an array and make your class traversable like an array. E.g.: Or if you want to store the internal objects on different levels within an multi dimensional array/object structure: This solution replaces your array by an object of type ""orderCollection"" but do not enable code completion within your IDE so far. Okay. Next step: Implement the methods that are introduced by the interface with docblocks - particular:  Do not forget to use type hinting for: This solution stops introducing a lot of: all over your code files (e.g. within loops) as Zahymaka confirmed with her/his answer. Your API user is not forced to introduce that docblocks to have code completion. To have @return on only one place reduces the redundancy (@var) as mutch as possible. Sprinkle ""docBlocks with @var"" would make your code worst readable. Finaly you are done. Looks hard to achive? Looks like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Not realy since you are familiar with that interfaces and with clean code. Remember: your source code is written once / read many. If code completion of your IDE do not work with this approach switch to a better one (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA PhpStorm Netbeans) or file a feature request on the issue tracker of your IDE producer. Thanks to Christian Weiss (from Germany) for being my trainer and for teaching me such a great stuff. PS: Meet me and him on XING.  Now usage of classes: Once again: I suspect not all IDE support it but PhpStorm does. Try yours post in comment the results! I know I'm late to the party but I've been working on this problem recently.  I hope someone sees this because the accepted answer although correct is > the best way you can do this.  Not in PHPStorm at least I haven't tested NetBeans though. The best way involves extending the ArrayIterator class rather than using native array types.  This allows you to type hint at a class-level rather than at an instance-level meaning you only have to PHPDoc once not throughout your code (which is not only messy and violates DRY but can also be problematic when it comes to refactoring - PHPStorm has a habit of missing PHPDoc when refactoring) See code below: The key here is the PHPDoc  to signify ""an array of Foo's"" but it's not supported by IDE's. I've found something which is working it can save lives !"
161,macos - Good C IDE for Mac? ,"I've just started a job where I'm programming in C on a Mac which is my first experience using a Mac for development. For now I'm using Xcode as my editor then using make/gcc/svn at the command line for compiling and source control. Is there a good full featured IDE out there for Macs that will compile C code (something comparable to VS would be ideal) or should I stick with these low level tools? EDIT: so I called Xcode a ""low level tool"" because I was under the impression that it was just a text editor for code like gvim. I will definitely look into it's compiling/source control features.You can also try  Xcode can manage project and compile for you as any IDE. But if you're familiar with CLI I would recommand you to use a good editor and your usual build tools. Emacs and vim are available on os x (using xcode just for its editor is not ideal). Many mac dev love the excellent TextMate editor but it is not a free (as in freedom) software. Obviously 'good' is a subjective decision but Xcode 3.2 is certainly up to par with what you can do in VisualStudio (if one considers VS good is another thing of course).   I have a project with 250000+ lines of codes 10 dylibs helpfile all in an SVN (Perforce) etc. and hardly ever go outside Xcode. Xcode has a few peculiar ways to do some things and the debugger is not quite as powerful as the current one in VisualStudio but overall there's hardly anything you can not do from within the IDE (and the options to adjust the shortcuts within the IDE Debugger and Editor to your needs are really awesome).

162,php - Popping the IDE cherry ,Although I've been a developer for years I've never used a PHP IDE - I've always just used a decent editor. What am I missing? I generally code on local servers so I can debug as if my code were running on my own machine I have code highlighting I have shortcuts set up to look up function names and so on. Is it worth investing the time in learning to use a full IDE? Is it worth investing the money in purchasing one? Looking at (the slightly aging)  I would probably go for PhpDesigner or possibly Eclipse.Consider  is a veteran in the IDE field. It's not free but it's not expensive either - yet. Has a long trial period and you can use it afterwards - it just closes every half an hour but that's it. phped from nusphere. We prefer it over zend). Regards rbo i've been using nuSphere netbeans and eclipse for a while and of these three i find netbeans the most usefull. it doesn't hang as often as eclipse does and it has a lot of shortcuts for project browsing. i find myself browsing the projects a lot faster using netbeans than the other 2 and it has a lot of features you most likely won't use but you can disable them so they won't eat up resources. I tried PHPed and nusphere debugger and it works really good too. I prefer PHPed instead NetBeans is lightweight you can encode your php scripts for distribution nusphere has php express too an extension to execute php scripts encoded with nucoder inside PHPEd.

175,python - Actually opening spyder IDE ,I've been trying to follow instructions on  I'm just trying to get the IDE running so that I can write my program within it to help me program easier. The only IDE i've used before is eclipse so maybe I'm not thinking of an IDE the right way but I'm expecting something kind of like eclipse.(>) I think our installation instructions are quite clear but I repeat them here for you again: If you are new to Python or the Scientific Python ecosystem we  recommend you to install and use . It comes with Spyder and all its dependencies along with the most important Python scientific libraries (i.e. Numpy Pandas Matplotlib IPython etc) in a single easy to use environment. After installing Anaconda you need to open the Anaconda Navigator (using Spotlight) and run Spyder from there. Another option is to open  but you should really remove what you installed with it and use Anaconda instead. As we said in our installation instructions too: We also support pip but please be aware that pip installations are for advanced users with good knowledge of all Spyder dependencies. This clearly seems to be not your case.
179,"ide - How do I ""Add Existing Item"" an entire directory structure in Visual Studio? ","I have a free standing set of files not affiliated with any C# project at all that reside in a complicated nested directory structure. I want to add them in that format to a different directory in an ASP.NET web application I am working on; while retaining the same structure. So I copied the folder into the target location of my project and I tried to “add existing  item” only to lose the previous folder hierarchy. Usually I have re-created the directories by hand copied across on a one-to-one basis and then added existing items. There are simply too many directories/items in this case. So how do you add existing directories and files in Visual Studio 2008?Drag the files / folders from Windows Explorer into the Solution Explorer. It will add them all. Note this doesn't work if Visual Studio is in Administrator Mode because Windows Explorer is a User Mode process. Enable > This is what I do: Then everything will be added on your solution from folders to files and files inside those folders. A neat trick I discovered is that if you go to ""Add existing..."" you can drag the folder from the open dialog to your solution. I have my Visual Studio to open in Admin Mode automatically so this was a good workaround for me as I didn't want to have to undo that just to get this to work. There is now an open-source extension in the Marketplace that seems to do what the OP was asking for:  If it doesn't do exactly what you want the code is available so you can modify it to suit your scenario. HTH What worked for me was to drag the folder into Visual Studio then right click the folder and select ""Open Folder in File Explorer"". Then select all and drag them into the folder in Visual Studio. In Windows 7 you could do the following: Right click on your project and select ""Add-&gt;Existing Item"". In the dialog which appears browse to the root of the directory you want to add. In the upper right corner you have a search box. Type  whatever the type of files you want to add. After the search finishes select all files click Add and wait for a while... The cleanest way that I've found to do this is to create a new Class Library project in the target folder and redirect all of its build output elsewhere.  It still leaves a .csproj file sitting in that folder but it does let you see it in Visual Studio and pick which files to include in your project. It's annoying that Visual Studio doesn't support this natively but CMake could generate the Visual Studio project as a work around. Other than that just use Qt Creator. It can then export a Visual Studio project."

You'll probably also want one of the various support plug-ins like: You'll need to explore other possible plug-ins later of course but this should get you started. > As requested debugging options.  I don't use debuggers often so I can't vouch for any of these.
192,Alternative SilkTest IDE ,"Coming from Eclipse there are many features that simply do not exist in the SilkTest IDE. My question is this: Is there an alternative IDE to SilkTest that I could use to maintain our SilkTest scripts? Something that can offer some of the power that Eclipse and many other mainstream IDEs bring to the table? Some of the power I'm referring to is: If the answer is ""No"" that's acceptable and is what I expect but I will wait for a short time to give others the opportunity to answer. Additionally we have the 2009 license of SilkTest. If these features are available in newer versions of the IDE that's also an acceptable answer. Thank you.For 4Test (SilkTest's classic scripting language) the answer is 'No'.  However for some time there are Silk4J and Silk4Net around which allow you to create your test scripts in either Eclipse or Visual Studio using Java or a .Net language. You can then use all the features the IDEs provide. Note:I work for Borland on the SilkTest team so my answers are probably biased."

194,java - Error: Could not find or load main class in intelliJ IDE ,"I'm a beginner in Java and am trying to run my code using IntelliJ that I just installed as my IDE with JDK 1.7.  The following piece of code keeps does not even compile and keeps giving me the error: Is there any change that i have to make in the compiler settings?? Or is it the code.This might help: 1) ""Build"" menu -&gt; """".Sometimes Intellij doesn't rewrite the classes because they already exist this way you ask Intellij to rewrite everything. 2) ""Run"" menu -&gt; """".  For me the solution was to fix the output directory under project settings.  Before I was using just ""target"" for the Project compiler output.  Instead I updated it to have a full path e.g. D:\dev\sigplusjava2_68\target If none of above answers didn't work for you just close your intelliJ IDE and remove intelliJ IDE file and folder from root of project:  Then open project with intelliJ. It must work now. I had this problem and I tried everything under the sun that I could think of and on this site.  None of my Java classes were being picked up after I pulled from a remote branch. All the classes had red Js by their names in the Project Hierarchy not blue Cs. In the end I tried to follow this tutorial and a few steps in tried something not described and fixed the issue: Now hit >  : I have encountered this problem with intellij :I have a maven multi-module project the problem is that i runing a class which not exist the  module within the configuration so my problem is fixed by setting the right module (""edit configuration"" -&gt; ""use class of module"")  may this help you Invalidate cache and restart your intellij it worked for me. I know this was asked a while ago but I was just stumbling over this issue and thought my findings might help others. As pointed out the error message is basically a result of the out folder. That's because when you're trying to run the program it compiles the code first and puts the compiled result to the out location and then it tries to load the compiled code from the out location. If the compiled code is not in the location expected you'll get the error.  The point I'm particularly wanting to share is that some times the code is not compiled (built) even though your run configuration specifies ""Build"" in the ""Before launch"" section of the configuration panel.  When can this happen? One situation that can cause this to happen is if you're using modules and you manually delete the module out directory. For example if I have a module named ""foo"" there should be a directory named foo under out/production. If you manually delete it the build system may not know that it needs to be rebuilt.  Even worse if you select Build | Build module 'foo' it still may not rebuild the module. If that's the case you should select a file in the module for example 'bar.java' and then select Build | Recompile 'bar.java'. Now the out directory out/production/foo should be restored.  Since IntelliJ typically knows about any changes going on this surprised me and took me a little time to figure out so I thought I'd share.  I have faced such problems when the class is in the default folder i.e. when the class does not declare a package. So I guess using a package statement (eg. ) on top of the class should fix it. I had to mark the ""src"" folder as ""Sources"". After restarting IntelliJ and rebuilding the project I could run the project without further issues (see ).Edit: You can access the ""Project Structure"" tab via File-&gt;Project Structure or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S. Open Modules Tab (Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S). I had two modules under one project. I've solve the problem after removing the second redundant module (see screenshot). As others have noted you have to . IntelliJ could not find the main class even though everything was set up correctly.My solution: delete the  folder then restart IntelliJ. Follow these steps Yippee....your code will run:) For me the problem was a special character in the file path. IntelliJ allowed me to open the project however when I built/ran the project it couldn't locate the class any more because it was transforming the file path to remove the special character and therefore was looking in the wrong directory. To solve the problem I just removed the special character from the folder name my project was stored in and reopened the project in IntelliJ."
197,IDE for elasticsearch ,I was searching extensively for having an IDE for elasticsearch. But I am unable to find one. I know it is simple Restclient will do but in most of the rest client the body editor doesnt have automatic indention and all. I was thinking If there is no IDE I can make one so that other people can also benefit from it. To make it I need how to create an editor? Any tools are available which will do proper json formatting while typing. IF that is there I can start a github project and start making an IDE. I can also add keywords of elastic search and it will easy for developers. IF that kind of thing is already there please point me to it. I am unable to find out one.The best option I have disovered so far is the Atom plugin . Elastic does not endorse promote or provide support for this application but works.
199,debugging - JavaScript IDE/Compiler ,"Now I hope some of you people will understand what I'm asking. I'm new to programming. I got introduced to JavaScript on Codecademy.com I use labs.codecademy.com for my JavaScript writing but it's limited. What IDE/Compiler can I use that's pretty simplistic in terms of being new to programming. Where I'm not surrounded by buttons that I don't know how to use yet. Does this even exist? A simple IDE?I think these two editors/IDEs are simple and good for beginners: More ""complicated"" but good javascript support: This is very subjective but nevertheless have look at this editors and choose what suites best for you. I hope I could help you. Notepad?  JavaScript doesn't have a compiler really.  Though there are ways of shrinking the code that some people call ""compiling"" but it isn't ""compiling"" in the strictest sense of the word. If you are looking for something JavaScript specific give  a try.  The personal license is $50 and I'm sure that while it will do more than you need right now it will grow with you. There is a 30 day trial. I was researching this exact question for my daughter. Like you she started learning JavaScript on Codecademy. She loves it but she is frequently frustrated when she doesn't understand why a program doesn't work. So I researched IDEs and debuggers and I read that Visual Studio has a debugger that is easy to use. But after installing 4 different versions I had to jump through lots of hoops to create a JavaScript project in Visual Studio Express 2013 and then I couldn't debug it. After a while I gave up and installed Eclipse. I have used Eclipse before and it's very powerful. I was originally looking for alternatives because I felt using Eclipse for JavaScript is kind of like using an airplane when all you need is a bicycle :) There are many versions and packages of Eclipse. I think this one might be the simplest to install:(Helios is a version and this specific package is for JavaScript developers) I actually used the latest version (Kepler). Unfortunately it doesn't have a package for JavaScript so I used the Java package:and then added JSDT: Yes Eclipse can be intimidating for a beginner but the good thing about Eclipse is that it works on multiple platforms you can find support for pretty much any language and it's free :) If you are serious about programming I recommend you invest a little time in learning how to use Eclipse. Let me know if this helps or if you have more questions."

209,c# - IDE Support for WinForms ,Hey guys I'm a newbie and I just wanted to know of the people who do Winforms on Visual studio at your place of work do your forms have IDE support. Because for some reason I don't have IDE support on 99% of the windows forms I'm working with. I mean I can not see anything on the design view except for errors is this the usual case in industry????Sorry WinForms is not broken for us (me). Check your code. Sometimes WinForms applications that were developed under Visual Sudio 2003 (or earlier) when upgraded to Visual Studio 2005 (or later) become unstable. Start with a new form and if the IDE (it is called a visual designer) works fine then think about re-creating the old forms from scratch with the newest VS installation. Are you using any 3rd party UI controls? Some have dll's for the design view to work and if you haven't installed the toolkit on your developer machine you might get errors like this.  One possible explanation for having errors on forms is licensing. If your company uses third-party controls on their forms they could cause errors when trying to display the forms on unlicensed machines. Another possible explanation for errors with third-party controls is simply installation. If you don't have the controls installed and referenced properly that could also cause errors. You could try to post some of the errors you have to another Stack Overflow question and perhaps the community could help you solve your errors.  Your question isn't clear! if the Visual Studio Designer not working well then re-install the IDE Or explain more... You should be able to view the forms in the design view. Always unless there is an error in code. In case the project is building you should get the same error (this is a runtime error) that you will generally get when you run the code.

224,eclipse - Help in writing a IDE ,"I m embarking on a difficult journey to create/replace a IDE for one of the middleware products from Bigblue. Thy have created a IDE based on eclipse and Its a PIA to use it and very very slow even on decent configuration machine. Problem is there is no alternative to this.But i m planning to create one.So to start off i need to write a GUI in C++. I m planning to use Qt for this.But i need to understand how eclipse generate aritifacts and such. There are some graphical elements in Eclipse IDE used by bigblue. I need to create exacltly those graphical elements in my IDE. So its basically writing a eclipse IDE only in C++  but for the middle ware product only. Any guidance  suggestions are most welcome.  I know i might fail in this endeavor but I would rather try and fail than just to complain about how slow the IDE is. Thanks all. Edit : I have been using the Eclipse IDE for 5 years provided by bigblue and its dead slow I have to use their version because it has customized environment for middleware tool.I m finally tired of it.:(Eclipse by itself isn't slow and Java is fairly fast so I have to think you would win by simply doing a better Eclipse plugin. If you don't believe me or if I'm wrong then I have to think the back-up plan is to write a plugin for a different IDE. Even VS has third-party plug-ins. You can try to optimize your running environment. Buy more RAM!  A development machine for Eclipse should have 4 GB RAM. Working with less is a waste of time. Optimize your Eclipse JVM parameters - lots of articles on that subject. I found that Eclipse works more smoothly on Mac OS X and Linux boxes than on Windows. My guess is that it is probably due to the superior memory management of Unix based OSs. Personally I often find myself running 2-3 instances of Eclipse on OS X and they are all running just fine. Do not judge the entire Eclipse ecosystem by your experience with a single IDE based on it. The Eclipse platform is not slow in itself and modern JVMs are pretty efficient (although a little memory hungry). If the IDE you are forced to use is slow and badly designed it is probably due to that particular IDE and not because of Eclipse itself. I have quite a few years of experience designing and implementing IDEs and I can tell you that if you embark on writing your own IDE you will need at least 3-4 people just to keep it up with the feature set found in Eclipse/Visual Studio/etc. If you write it only for your own use you will find that you get very little time over to do real work. Eclipse is a wonderful ""platform"" for developing our own IDE.  That way you don't need to worry too much about the mundane things and you can focus on what sets your IDE apart.  A good place to start is the   The only practical way to approach the problem as described in the OP is to write your IDE features as an extension to an existing IDE framework. For a full-featured IDE you'll probably be starting with one of the following: If you write your own IDE from scratch you'll spend all your time working on the core IDE and end up with a product not nearly as good as one based on an existing IDE. Use a profiler to guide your work and you'll find the extension plenty fast enough."
230,Delphi XE6 - IDE File Open button shuts down the IDE ,"Odd behaviour for an IDE choose File Open from the main file menu or press the file Open button on the toolbar and the IDE shuts down. Select ""Exit"" on the File menu to shut down the IDE and it produces the File Open Dialog. It seems unlikely that this is intentional behaviour or have the programmers gone mad? Update: It looks like when XE6 is first opened the buttons behave properly then reverse when a new vcl application is created. The machine is Dell latitude Win7 32 bit laptop. I have installed XE6 on my Win7 64 bit desktop machine and it appears to function correctly.This can be caused by extra files being added to the IDE's Bin folder. In my case it was the FastMM dlls.  I found the answer on the Embarcardero Forums: Per Remy's answer The IDE's copy protection is being invoked at startup. If unauthorized  non-Embarcadero files are placed in the IDE's \bin folder the  actions of the file menu's  Open and Exit items are swapped. You need  to find the offending files in the \bin folder and remove them. The poster there has the issue in XE5 I experienced the issue in Delphi 10.1 Berlin. With probability close to 1 this is due to one of the design time packages that you have installed in your IDE. Remove these packages one by one until the IDE returns to its normal behaviour. At that point you will have identified the faulty package and can dig deeper to understand why it breaks your IDE.   It seems that people other than you are facing the same issue. It is possible that they have installed the same third party components as you that are defective. And of course it is possible that this is in fact a Delphi IDE defect. "

ThanksDimaKDevelop because: Since you are comparing KDevelop with Eclipse let me also point out that: Also when I've used KDevelop I've been using it on Ubuntu which uses the Gnome desktop. On Gnome KDevelop still beats Eclipse in terms of startup time and is definitely worth using. Also one last note if you use CMake with KDevelop then you can distribute your source code to users on Windows Mac and Linux and they will be able to compile your source code even if they don't have KDevelop; CMake can generate a native Makefile a Visual Studio project an Xcode project or a KDevelop project. So the concern that you can't replace KDevelop really doesn't apply if you use the CMake backend. I use  works well as an IDE on linux given that it can be set up with integrated build and debugging. Code Blocks is an option I think the correct answer is to try both (and maybe others) for yourself. Personally I've used Eclipse for the past ~3 years. I'm satisfied with it but there are parts that I think could be better.  But I think your best bet is to install both and try them each for a week or 2 (maybe longer). A lot of this comes to do personal preference and taste. This is the 2009 version of the vi or emacs question :) I use CDT on eclipse I find it very responsive. Plus plugins like Subclipse Mylyn etc really make development a lot easier. I use Java and C++ together is some projects so the fact I can code Java/JNI/CPP in the one IDE makes life a lot easier in my opinion. If you are looking for light IDE you can try vim. With appropriate plug-ins and skills it might be very powerful. QtCreatorEclipseNetbeansKDevelop Each has strengths and weaknesses and it'll depend a lot on on what else you're doing. You can also try  \M/
234,c# - Selenium IDE testscript to Selenium IDE ,I have a question. Is there anybody here who could at least give me an idea or a video perhaps on how to create a test script from Selenium IDE converting it into Selenium webdriver setting it up in the visual studio and successfully running it. Your help is highly appreciated.There are dozens and dozens of these videos already online. There is no point in using IDE. Go straight to webdriver. You must chose a language to write in first C#Java etc. If you don't know either of these it's best to study these first and then move on to Selenium webdriver. I suggest C#. You can use the Microsoft virtual academy to learn this from scratch.  Best of luck-Aaron
236,hex - Regarding HiTop5 IDE from Hitex ,I have a STM32 Performance stick for developing USB device.It comes along with HiTop5 IDE for software development and debugging. I have written programs and flashed into the microcontroller using the IDE. Now I want to use only the microcontroller and want to load the programs I have written using the IDE to it. There is a .htp file created to load the project once build is done and .elf created in the objects folder. But there seems to be no hex file created for me to load the program with other methods. I've searched the net on how to create a hex using this IDE. But didn't find any.  Has anybody used this IDE and know how to generate a hex file from it?Go to Project settings in Hitop IDE in the select the application of the project openedclick on the general box Check the create standard code box it will ask for intel hex or s format select intel hex option.Next time you build the project hex file will be generated.
238,Advanced Java IDE Advice ,Is there any Java IDE that allows me see the bytecode what is going on the stack when i keep stepping into? Something similar what i've seen in visual (disassembly memory registers).how about something like this:

The tests are run but I always get as a result: "">"". Additionally the coverage window that the IDE opens after run tests is empty:  If I run test coverage via terminal and export to html it works fine. Example: Is there any known problem with IDE? Any solution?"
241,angular - ionic 2 BEST IDE? ,I am going to create a mobile app using ionic2(angular2).Can anyone suggest a good IDE? (Netbeens Eclipse and so on...)Visual Studio Code  WebStorm are two mostly used .VS Code is free and very good for angular 2 .                      
242,python - Vpython in Wing IDE ,"I am using Wing IDE and I have installed VIDLE with Vpython. VIDLE works fine but if I want to use it on Wing IDE somehow it can't import the visual module. It always gives an error ""No module named visual"". How can I import the visual module into the IDE? I thought maybe the problem lies in the version of the Vpython or the Python itself. The installed Vpython is for Python 2.7 (I've tried another one for 3.4 but the VIDLE wouldn't work with it). Both Python 2.7 and 3.4 are installed on the PC but I don't even know which one is taken as default on the IDE. So if this really has something to do with the version how can I change the Python path on Wing IDE? Sorry I am quite new in Python and I've looked everywhere but didn't come to any helpful answer. Thank you in advance."
246,visual studio - Eclipse IDE Learning Curve ,I am a C# guy with pretty good grasp of Visual Studio IDE usage (using it since VS2003).Right now I am doing a proof of concept app using Eclipse 3.4.1.

257,terminology - confused with the IDE concept ,this question though has nothing to do with the programming stuff gets me bugged while I try to delve deeper a bit. I am confused with what this IDE means. somewhere it says its an editor or somewhere like its some PHP editor. I use dreamweaver normally and notepad ++ occasionally .. Is this what IDE is ? or is that I have misunderstood things.??An integrated development environment is generally a whole bunch of tools integrated into one. This includes editor compiler debugger and whatever other tools you may want to add. Back in pre-history we used to use an editor to edit the files then we would exit and use a compiler then a linker to produce the final product (actually when I first started we used punch cards and 80x25 data entry sheets and handed them to data entry operators for input into the computer but I don't want to bore the youngsters among you). Nowadays we just press the  key or if you use Emacs      
258,Best IDE for developing Java Desktop Applications ,I've been developing Java Web apps using Eclipse as the IDE. Planning to start developing a desktop app based on Java.  Can someone suggest the best IDE for developing Java based desktop apps? (One that would have drag drop for building the interface like Visual Studio)I recommend   Response to RTFM messages:I agree reading the manual is a good way to learn more about the tool. The OP is trying to figure out a few tools to learn more in depth and finally zero in on one (or a subset to meet varying requirements). To get to the first list before reading the accompanying manuals one would require some directions and help based on experience. If you had to read manuals of all related tools before identifying the tool that meets your requirement a new tool would have come in or your project would have gone past you! Response to original question on best IDE based editor: In some ways it doesn't matter which tool you use as long as you put the effort into learning it in depth. Know your tools! Read the Free Manual! In practice: you would want to pick Eclipse for SWT and Netbeans for Swing (Matisse is great when you are getting started). I haven't used IntelliJ but I am sure it is excellent. A couple of years ago I used Eclipse with  which I found very useful. I liked the code that it generated - it was really easy to take that and add the extra functionality I needed. if you aim for windows only than Visual studio is the best choice.For multiple platforms Mono is very good and it does not have java's .Of course you would use C# rather than Java if going with Mono or VS.
260,debugging - IronPython embedded IDE ,"I'd like to use embedded IronPython as a way of allowing users to script / extend my app. Running the scripts is easy enough but I also need to provide some sort of IDE or editor as well - this is the bit I'm not sure how to do. As far as I can see I have only a few options: The trouble with options 1. and 2. is that obviously they are a lot of work! (And will most likely be far inferior to ""real"" IDEs) - I was kind of hoping that someone else might have written an IronPython IDE that I could extend and embed in my app but I've had no such luck. Option 3. would be my preference - I'd imagine that I would save my script to a temporary file and then start the IDE with the path to my file as a parameter.  The problem is that in order to be able to test / run the scripts I need to set up some environmental objects beforehand - this makes testing and debugging the scripts from an external IDE rather cumbersome. I don't mind insisting that only certain IDEs are supported (i.e. Visual Studio) and so I was kind of thinking I could write out a custom MSBuild file that ensured that the environment was all set up correctly when someone pressed F5 but then I realised I was starting to be silly.  The other option I considered was if there were any open source IDEs that I could canibalise into embedded script editor. Or alternatively is there another soltion that I'm missing?The  is open source and it already has support for Python (but not IronPython AFAIK) so I imagine that might get you pretty close to what you want with some modifications.  Licensing is pretty liberal (LGPLv2 and MIT)."
263,Best IDE for Grails 1.1.X development ,I've been on a frustrating quest to find an IDE which provides reasonable support for Grails 1.1 development. My minimum requirements are: Here's a rundown of my experience so far Using the latest plugins available from the update site Eclipse's support for Groovy/Grails is truly pathetic. It provides little more than code completion and spurious errors As soon as I imported the project NetBeans began scanning it. The Navigator view was waiting for the scanning to finish before showing it's contents. About 20 minutes later both the Navigator view and I were still waiting. Also support for code completion on dynamic finders is poor and for some reason it copied all the plugins into $PROJECT_ROOT/web-app/plugins.  Although the general consensus is that IntelliJ is the best IDE for Groovy/Grails . The root cause of the problem appears to be the change in the location of the plugins folder. IntelliJ is unable to build the app because it can't find classes I'm importing from plugins even though those plugins are listed in application.properties So my question (finally) is whether anyone has found an IDE (not TextMate or Vim) that works with Grails 1.1.X when the plugin folder is in it's default location i.e. under $HOME/.grails/1.1.X/plugins? If so I'd be really grateful for information about: ThanksDonI'm unclear on which version of IntelliJ  IDEA the author of that blog post tested tha didn't work with Grails 1.1.1.   Idea 8.1.2 works very well for me on OSX with Grails 1.1 and 1.1.1.  Grails is installed under /Developer/grails-1.1.1 (with a symlink at /Developer/grails ) and the plugins are in the ~/.grails/1.1.1/plugins directory.    I didn't have to install any extra Idea plugins. What I did have to do was tell it where the plugins were and install the missing ones once I had upgraded to 1.1.1.  IDEA's grails integration can even recognize the plugins from the Grails repository and install them from the IDE. . The Spring Tools Suite is also an excellent choice for grails/groovy development. I use it and do not have any cause for regret. I've been using Netbeans 6.7 for some time and it's very slow the code completion rarely works. Basically I'm using it as an editor and to format my code. I used the EAP version of IDEA 8.1 and it was really nice - very easy to setup and develop in compared to the other IDEs.  Sorry I don't remember exactly how to import an existing project but it was fairly straight forward. If cost is not an issue then IDEA would probably be the best choice. I use STS (SpringSource Toolkit) I like it better than Intellij or Netbeans. I am using 2.3.3.M2
264,minify - Integrate Google closure compiler with Eclipse IDE? ,Does anybody know how to integrate  with Eclipse IDE? The thing I was trying to do is to configure Google closure compiler as a external tool for Eclipse IDE.

270,php - Lightweight IDE for Linux ,Even though I have a robust and fast computer (Pentium Dual Core 2.0 with 2Gb RAM) I'm always searching for lightweight software to have on it so it runs fast even when many apps are up and running simultaneously. On the last few weeks I've been migrating gradually to Linux and want to install a free lightweight yet useful IDE to program on C++ and PHP.  Syntax highlighting and code completion tips are must-haves. (or Emacs varying on religion) will always be my first answer to this question over any point-and-click IDE.As they write in  for Gtk/Gnome for KDE? Again it's a 'smart editor' rather than an IDE.  Seems to know how to handle most languages and once its started it is pretty smart still Java but less resource hungry than Netbeans and Eclipse. I would say ).

288,Liferay IDE Alternatives ,I am using Liferay Developer Studio for theme development and as a frontend developer I am not impress with the tool's performance. Below are few reasons I am looking for alternative IDE compatible for Liferay development. I am sure there are many others too faced same issues which actually makes the development slower. This question is not against the Liferay of course it's a great enterprise level CMS tool. But yes looking for alternate IDE with best compatibility for the purpose. Thanks in advance.You can use  as editor.  Please refere to those links : 1 -  You can use any IDE you want. The only one difference between LiferayIDE and others IDEs is you can avoid using BladeCLI by hands. And nothing can stop you to use another IDE build you project with maven or gradle and then continue to develop. If you are a front-end developer you really should use Gulp and Yo. First time you'll feel yourself confused a bit but after short period of time you'll understand all benefits.

I have closed eclise and tried again but no result. I have restarted my system and tried again but IDE is still not working and showing ""Android SDK content Loader (0%)"" Please help me to solve this! I can think of a handful of reasons why its not loading. Quickest solution to this is to uninstall your IDE and re-install it with the latest SDK. Be sure to save your projects and reload them after you install Eclipse.  Which Eclipse you are using? If you are using older version please find a newer version. I don't know how HAXM creates this problem. As treesandlake has said you can do that also. But I think you need a updated Eclipse."

323,cant find ruby iDE ,I know its a bad title. I have just downloaded Ruby from  because I thought it might be a cool language to learn but I can't find where the IDE is in the folder is there an IDE with it or not? If so can anyone tell me where it is?Ruby is just the interpreter and doesn't provide any IDE. You can use the editor of your choice like  The state of Ruby IDEs in 2016 is very sad the original question does not deserve to be rated down as it addresses a valid point. Except Intellij Rubymine there is no actively maintained fully featured IDE available for Ruby that supports Intellisense (or comparable functionality) and fast visual debugging. Unless you shell out more than USD200 in the first year and still more than USD100 each subsequent year to Intellij you'll have to do with Emacs Vi(m) Atom Visual Studio Code etc. like solutions for source code editing without Intellisense support and rely on rdebug ruby-debug-ide (super slow!) or my favorite debugging console: pry. I am hoping for someone to enable Intellisense for Ruby in Visual Studio Code and provide a decent debugging plugin there. There are many IDEs which support Ruby. There is Ruby Mine from Intellij Netbeans has a Ruby setting. Atom has a Ruby setting and is my favorite right now. I'm sure Visual Studio and Visual Studio code both have Ruby plugins.  Typically programming languages do not come with a dedicated IDE because IDEs only help you a little technically you can just use Notepad. So it's up to you to find one that you like.

I do not know which IDE is best suitable for codeingiter framework. is there any one who can help me in this regard. thanks.If you want a simple IDE you can go for  just use Google for the others). There is many IDE Editor available in market for development but PHP Storm and Sublime text Editor is best for PHP Development I found netbeans the best IDE for php development so far. It has got nice auto-completion feature debugging utility and most importantly easy to use version controll system to list some. Before I've used Zend Studio for coding but then I've moved to the Netbeans as far as it's the best IDE for me with very useful plug-ins such as svn git etc... and auto code format functionality is very useful to make your code neat and improve the readability of your code.
338,IDE for PHP with Visual Designer? ,"Im new to PHP..I commonly see online that many PHP developers like to code php in simple notepad.. however   its always nice to use an IDE which helps the user being more productive by making fewer mistakes and writing good code. My Question is ""WHICH IS THE BEST IDE FOR DEVELOPMENT IN PHP?"" Im looking for a PHP IDE which provides good:- For me its important to have a visual designer in an IDE. Various IDE's dont have this such as Netbeans. Also is there any way to develop PHP applications in Visual Studio? (without/with using VS add-on)First of all I dont like to say ""I prefer Notepad"". It is just a lie and foolishness. Notepad is good for students who want to learn very basic. For an experienced programmer it is wasting of time like saying MSDOS is better than Windows7 . :D In my line of work I have used Eclipse NuSphere phpED Netbeans Dreamveawer PHPDesigner PSPad UltraEdit and Notepad as well. Among them Dreamveawer has the Visual Designer but for PHP I dont like it much. Eclipse Netbeans PHPDesigner and NuSphere phpED are my best choice for PHP coding. I like the code completion feature of them. I suggest you can do the design part with Dreamveawer (DV is best for Visual Designing for me). Then you can use another IDE for PHP Coding. Eclipse &amp; Netbeans are both doing a nice job and are free. :) For designing you can use Dreamweaver etc and then later embedd PHP code  Use -markkoberlein I user .  About your requests: My experience with ide:s is that almost every ide out there is realy good but they allmoust allways lack in som functionality. For instance:PHPEdit is the only ide that has good support for sitedebugging with . I think is a great ide and ther's also a personal lisence for opensource projects d.s. Expression Web 4 isn't the most robust for PHP but it's got the HTML and CSS (visually) down pretty well. Doesn't have the ""Live View"" of DW though. I completely recommend you try PHPStorm. It doesn't have the visual features of DW but it excels in PHP. Debugging is easy to set up. It does language injection (autocompleting HTML in PHP statement for example) which almost no other IDE does. It pretty light on it's feet and is very extensible.  For design view - drag and drop components onto a form - take a look at Embarcadero's HTML5 builder.     Set form and component properties write PHP and JavaScript Events.Forms for visual components and a hidden ""datamodule"" form for database connection query and table components to work out your data logic.     This upgrades and renames their RadPHP product which was principally for building PHP/javascript browser applications - a sort of Visual Studio for the PHP language - and adds development for mobile devices with this upgrade.Lots of features but only shows those relevant to whether you are designing coding or debugging to keep it simple.     Gives easy intuitive and quick results for the novice (like me!) and rapid development for experts. The hype is about mobile but is still an awesome web development tool - and not expensive compared with other editors.  Sorry if this sounds like a sales pitch but the IDE deserves to be better known."

What exactly is going on?From what I see ANTLR IDE is based on Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) while Aptana Studio stand-alone is shipped with Eclipse 3.6.

348,terminology - Java Framework IDE ,Hi anybody please tell me the difference between IDE and a FRAMEWORK suppose that am using eclipse (for java) by default which framework am following.IDE Stands for Integrated Development Environment and is a tool that allows you to program in a certain language and usually includes an integrated compiler debugger syntax highlighting and various other tools that allow you to develop applications quicker. E.g. Eclipse IDE Visual Studio Netbeans IDE. A framework is a library or set of classes that makes it easier to implement a certain type of application and is usually deployed with your application. It usually provides a structure that you need to adhere to and various helper classes. E.g. Spring Framework .Net MVC Struts etc. IDE is the development environment the editor where you would normally write code. It also might include a compiler debugger ... A framework is a set of reusable libraries or classes which you could use in your code. Some IDE's (eclipse netbeans) offer a > a framework i.e. you follow its rules enjoy its benefits and suffer its limitations (although a good framework offers extension points to minimise these).  Contrast this with a library which is a collection of code units (e.g. functions classes etc.) from which you draw as necessary but without constraining the structure of your own code. Using a framework is a bigger architectural decision than using a library. A typical enterprise project will use one or more frameworks and several libraries.

362,Why do we use WebDriver instead of Selenium IDE? ,Why can't we just record all of our test cases in  and run it in WebDriver with Eclipse? I need a clear explanation as I am very much confused in using WebDriver! And can anyone please explain why IDE recorded scripts fail in WebDriver?why cant we just record all of our test cases in IDE export it to java/webdriver and run it in webdriver Great question and here is the answer: Selenium IDE is a Record and Playback tool which is very easy to use but it's very unreliable.  Record and playback is typically a frowned upon in web applications.  Since web applications are frequently changed the IDE is not an ideal solution for a production environment because of the maintenance nightmare that may arise. Let me give you a practical example.  You record your test and you find an element with a dynamic ID.  Sure we can import it into eclipse but what happens when that test starts failing down the road? why not simply make your test agile and independent to catch these in the first place. It also boils down to your principles of test automation.  Test automation in MY opinion (and several other professionals) believe that test automation should be approached from a programming perspective.  Programmers should write the tests and maintain the tests.  Ideally your quality assurance personnel should be trained to write and maintain their own tests. So again back to your question the IDE is designed to be a quick solution to automation NOT a solution to a full regression suite.   And can anyone please explain why IDE recorded scripts fail in Webdriver? I haven't used the IDE in a while but the reason they fail is because the scripts that are exported are simply the  not an entire java file.  This also is because Selenium IDE exportations are supposed to be agnostic when it comes to how to run your test.  Say I'm a user of jUnit.. what if Selenium IDE exported it to TestNG all the time?  That wouldn't be fair.. honestly i'd rather create my own tests than changing that one line every single time i create my test file. You may read the full text of a research conducted called Why do Record/Replay Testsof Web Applications Break?For a Maven integration of flow controls command/aliases/macros used by Selenium IDE and Maven's SureFire test plugin see: for some examples. We've also used our selenium test cases for load testing with Soasta - WebDriver allows simple IDE tests to be used in many different contexts. Because when the complexity of your code will increase it will be difficult for you to manage it using IDE. Maintenance of your scripts will be difficult using IDE. Also Exporting test cases from IDE to webdriver is not 100% reliable. Other people have said a lot of helpful answers. One thing that is missing is that if you write code instead of using the IDE you have the power to make changes to the database. It depends on the website you are testing how useful this is but here are some useful examples I've experienced. In one case the website had multiple sections of a class. One of our tests was merging these sections into one. The IDE couldn't do this. But with webdriver we can add all of our test data into the database perform the merge and then remove the data from the database.  Another advantage that webdriver has is Selenium Grid. With Grid you can run your tests in parallel and on multiple browsers. This makes your testing run faster and you can more thoroughly test the code. 
367,React Native online IDE ,I'm interested in learning React Native however I have old amd computer which can't run Anroid Simulator. Is there any online IDE with android emulator for React Native? I would like to be able to compile app.I know I can run it on AWS but unfortunately I don't have credit card. I can pay with paypal.You can run it from snack.io. From your browser exactly your will get a simulator and an editor. However you can run projects only created in your snack account. CHECK OUT expo.com before you proceed.
368,IDE Plugin to handle Qooxdoo syntax ,does anyone know about an IDE or eventually a (preferrably Aptana) IDE plug-in which adds support for Qooxdoo framework? Thanks.Spket IDE has autocompletion support for qooxdoo:  Edit: Spket actually works fine with newer qooxdoo versions just create a profile using a qooxdoo 1.3 SDK folder as shown in the linked page.
373,Why use an IDE? ,"This may be too opinionated but what I'm trying to understand why some companies mandate the use of an IDE. In college all I used was vim although on occasion I used netbeans for use with Java. Netbeans was nice because it did code completion and had some nice templates for configuration of some the stranger services I tried.  Now that my friends are working at big companies they are telling me that they are required to use eclipse or visual studio but no one can seem to give a good reason why. Can someone explain to me why companies force their developers into restricted development environments?If you're good at using vim and know everything there is to know about it then there is no reason to switch to an IDE. That said many IDEs will have lots of useful features that come standard. Maintaining an install of Eclipse is a lot easier than maintaining an install of Vim with plugins X Y and Z in order to simulate the same capabilities. And the most important of all... I love vim and will use it for simple things or when I want to run a macro or am stuck with C code. But for more complicated tasks I'll fire up Eclipse/Visual Studio/Wing. I've written code in lots of different IDEs and occasionally in notepad.  You may totally love notepad but at some point using notepad is industrial sabatoge kind of like hiring a gardener who shows up with a spoon instead of a shovel and a thimble instead of a bucket.  (But who knows maybe the most beautiful garden can be made with a spoon and a thimble but it sure isn't going to be fast) Some IDE's have team and management features.  For example in Visual Studio there is a screen that finds all the TODO: lines in source code. This allows for a different workflow that may or may not exist in other IDEs.  Ditto for source control integration static code analysis etc. Big organizations are slow to change. Not really a programming related problem. Because companies standardize on tools as well as platforms--if your choice of tools is in conflict with their standards then you can either object silently use your tool or use the required tool.   All three are valid; provided your alternative doesn't cause other team-members issues and provided that you have a valid argument to make (not just whining). For example: I develop in Visual Studio 2008 as required by work but use VS2010 whenever possible.  Solutions/Projects saved in 2010 can't be opened in 2008 without some manual finagling--so I can't use the tool of my choice because it would cause friction for other developers.  We also are required to produce code according to documented standards which are enforced by Resharper and StyleCop--if I switched to a different IDE I would have more difficulty in ensuring the code I produced was up to our standards.  Sufficiently bad developers are greatly assisted by the adoption of an appropriately-configured IDE.  It takes a lot of extra time to help each snowflake through his own custom development environment; if somebody doesn't have the chops to maintain their own dev environment independently it gets very expensive to support them. Corporate IT shops are very bad at telling the difference between ""sufficiently bad"" and ""sufficiently good"" developers.  So they just make everybody do the same thing. Disclaimer: I use Eclipse and love it. Theoretically it would decrease the amount of training needed to get an unexperienced developer to deal with the problems of a particular IDE if all the team uses that one tool. Anyway most of the top companies don't force developers to use some specific IDE for now... I agree with this last way of thinking: You don't need your team to master one particular tool having team knowledge in many will improve your likelyhood to know better ways to solve a particular roblems. For me I use Visual Studio with ReSharper.  I cannot be nearly as productive (in .Net) without it.  At least nobody has ever shown me a way to be more productive... Vim that is great.  You can run Vim inside of Visual Studio + R# and get all the niceties that the IDE provides like code navigation code completion and refactoring. Same reason we use a hammer to nail things instead of rocks.  It's a better tool. Now if you are asking why you are forced to use a specific IDE over another well that's a different topic. A place that uses .NET will use Visual Studio 99% of the time at least that's what I've seen.  And I haven't found anything out there that is better than Visual Studio for writing .NET applications. There is much more than code completion into an IDE: etc Nothing to do with incompetence from the programmers. Anybody would be A LOT less productive using vim for developing a big Java EE application. How big were you projects at college? A couple of classes in a couple of files? Or rather a couple of hundreds of classes in a couple of hundreds of files? Today I had the ""honor"" of looking at a file in a rather large project where the programmer opted to use vi (yes vi not vim) and a handcrafted commandline compiler call (no ). The file contained on function spanning about 900 lines with a series of if-else-if-else-constructs (because that way you have all your code in one place!!!!!!). Macho-Programmer at his finest. OK there are very good reasons for enforcing a particular toolset within a production environment: Companies want to standardize everything so that if an employee leaves they can replace that person with minimal effort. Commercial IDEs provide a complex enough environment to support a single interface for a variety of development needs and supporting varying levels of code access. For instance the same file-set could be used by the developer by non-programmers (graphics designers etc.) and document writers.  Combine this with integrated version control and code management without the need of someone learning a particular version control system all of a sudden IDEs start to look nicer and nicer. It also streamlines maintenance of build systems in a multi-homed environment. IDEs are easier to give tutorials to via phone or video and probably come with those. etc. etc. and so forth. The business decision making behind enforcing a standardized environment goes beyond the preference of a single programmer or for that matter perhaps the understanding of the programming team.   Using an IDE helps an employee to work with huge projects with minimal training. Learn a few key combos - and you will comfortably work with multi-thousand-file project in Eclipse IDE handles most of the work for you under the hood. Just imagine how many years of learning it takes to feel comfortable developing such projects in Vim. Besides with an IDE it is easy to support common coding standards across the entire team: just set a couple of options and an IDE will force you to write code in a standardized way. Plus IDE gives a few added bonuses like refactoring tools (especially good in Eclipse) integrated debugging (especially good in Visual Studio) intellisense integrated unit tests integrated version control system etc. The advantages and disadvantages of using an IDE also greatly depends on the development platform. Some platforms are geared towards the use of IDEs others are not. As a rule of thumb you should use IDE for Java and .Net development (unless you're extremely advanced); you should not use IDE for ruby python perl LISP etc development (unless you're extremely new to these languages and associated frameworks). Features like these aren't available in vim: Those are the reasons I choose IntelliJ.  I could go back to sticks and bones but I'd be a lot less productive. As said before the question about using an IDE is basicaly productivity. However there is some questions that should be considered by the company when choosing a specific IDE. that includes: Of course there is a lot more. However I think that this short list help you to see that there is some decisions that are not so easy to take when we are talking about money and some greater companies. And if you start using your own IDE think what mess will be when another developer start doing maintenance into your code. How do you think will the application be signed at the version manager ? Now think about a company with 30+ developers each using its own IDE (each with its own configuration files version and all that stuff)...  Real programmers use the best tools available to get the job done.  Some companies have licenses for tools but there's nothing saying you can't license/use another IDE and then just have the other IDE open to copy/paste what you've done in your local IDE. The question is a bit open-ended perhaps you can make it community wiki... As you point out the IDE can be useful or even a must have for some operations like refactoring or even project exploring: I use Eclipse at my work on Java projects and I find very useful to get a list of all occurrences of the usage of a public method or a class in a project. Likely I appreciate to be able to rename it from where it is defined and having all these occurrences automatically updated.The fact I have the JavaDoc displayed when hovering over a name is very nice too. Like autocompletion jump to a class name etc.And of course debugging facilities... Now usage of Eclipse isn't mandatory in our shop! Some years ago some people used the Delphi IDE (forgot its name) I tried NetBeans etc. But I think we > standardized on Eclipse but it was a natural evolution rather than a company policy. And we often just open files in a text editor when we need a quick update..."
374,Monaca IDE - console.log never appears ,X-Post from here for exposure:   Odd question but only once while using Monaca IDE has anything ever shown up in the console.log portion of the IDE itself. It only occurred when I had a device synced via the debugger. I have since tried syncing it and I never get the device to show in the drop down box it usually says unknown device /www/html/… Now do know that I have put several console.log(‘test’); lines of code to try this out and still no success. I would think that the IDE’s console area would show the log operations from the emulator and not from the device debugger as it has its own log that is view-able on the device but this apparently isn’t the case. Is this correct or am I just really missing something simple here?So this isn’t that big of an issue but I figured out the problem. Basically I keep the Monaca IDE tab open in Chrome all the time (I work via my laptop remotely). When I come back after a long absence (several hours I don’t know what the time out is) the bottom section in the console has the Chrome error showing like that page timed out. The IDE is still there just that section is grayed out. So to fix this I would just refresh the page. The section pops back and all is good EXCEPT I just figured out that it is at that moment when the device connection no longer works. I can still click Run on Device and it works - syncing with the device - but the console.log no longer shows up. In order to get that back and working you have to close the tab and reopen it; then everything works.

Is there a way to integrate it into vim/gedit/eclipse/etc? Thanks.I had a similar question. I wanted to have bpython in Vim as i was getting tired of switching between terminal and Vim. Turns out there is a fantastic plugin ( as there usually are for Vim :) called  and smile :) I think it works for Ipython and others as well.. 
384,Eclipse-based IDE development ,I've developed a compiler for a static-typed language using eclipse ad its ANTLR plugin. And now I'm interested to know whether it's possible to develop an IDE for this language as an eclipse plugin. Is there any tool for developing eclise-based IDEs compliant with ANTLR grammars?Take a look at  which is a framework for developing language tools (including IDEs).There are plenty of SO questions about it and how it relates to/uses ANTLR. For example:

This is the code I am using at the moment: However when I run this Firefox opens but the button to launch the Selenium IDE is not displayed. Any ideas?Just found this solution on the web.  You have to unpack the xpi file by renaming to .zip and extracting the selenium-ide.xpi file only. Use the path to this file to set up your profile.
389,Selenium IDE record doesn't work ,"The title says it all.  The ""Record"" feature in the Selenium IDE doesn't do anything.  I'm using FF 28 &amp; IDE 2.5.

I am using the same version of both selenium and FF. i think you accidentally change the format. for restoration please go to IDE &gt;&gt; option &gt;&gt; Format &gt;&gt; HTML."
390,java - Weblogic without their IDE? ,I'm starting Java development at a place that uses Weblogic on their production and test servers.   I'd like to use Weblogic on my computer to develop my code.   It seems that Weblogic has a development environment where a personal web server/servlet container is tightly integrated with an Eclipse based IDE of theirs. I think I might like to go that way eventually but for right now I would like to keep using the IDE that I am used to. Can someone point me to a tutorial or a book that would explain how to set up and use Weblogic that way on my computer? For instance  I would produce a WAR file with my own tools  then stick it in a directory in Weblogic on my computer to run it and see how well it works. ThanksIf you have not already downloaded WebLogic I would suggest getting started with the Zip Distribution.  It is a smaller distribution than the full installer and you can get it up and running quickly.  Here's a YouTube demo of the Zip Distribution:  and you'll have a nice state-of-the-art development solution.

401,java - NetBeans IDE under Oracle ,"I'm a bit freaked about what I just read. I did some research as I want to start programming in Java and I came to the conclusion that NetBeans is the best IDE for me because of its capable Swing GUI Designer and powerful reporting with Jasper Reports (iReport).  Yet Oracle (who will soon buy Sun) doesn't seem to care about NetBeans. As I will start building appz in Java no too long from now I would like to know your opinion on the following matter: Shall I continue using NetBeans in spite of the rumours that Oracle will discontinue it or shall I make another the IDE of choice? PS: Basically NetBeans would be the choice but because of the current circumstances I'm doubting this decision. Thank you Oracle have put a lot of time and money into their own product JDeveloper.  It has some pretty neat features.  But it has never got much traction in the industry because many Java developers don't like using proprietary software even though Oracle make quite a big play over their commit to open standards. Anyway at the moment Oracle are still integrating a lot of their freshly acquired BEA WebLogic functionality into the JDeveloper suite.  But I'm sure that once they have sealed the deal to buy Sun they will start to look at what they can take from NetBeans.  Because whatever you may think about Larry Ellison's business methods he knows the value of a dollar.  If there are things worth having in NetBeans they will not be thrown away they will end up in JDeveloper.  So you say it will abandon NetBeans  and salvage some pieces which will go  into JDeveloper? In the long run Oracle will not maintain two Java IDEs.  But look at their strategy for handling previous acquisitions (Seibel JD Edwards BEA etc).  Oracle have kept those products current while they devised a plan for getting the customers onto Oracle's own brand applications.  In some cases this meant dumping Oracle's offering in favour of the acquired product (Seibel Analytics BEA WebLogic Server).  Oracle has made similar sounding pronouncements with regards to MySQL.  People may scoff but I think Oracle will keep MySQL going partly because Larry thinks they can make money from it but also just to spike .  The pertinent bit is NetBeans the Sun-driven open source  Java IDE that has competed with Oracle  JDeveloper and the Eclipse platform  will remain as a ""lightweight  development environment for Java  developers"" Kurian said. But  JDeveloper continues as Oracle's  enterprise development tool. I was a long time eclipse user and although I still like it for some things I believe Netbeans to be a far superior IDE for Java development.  I would say go ahead and use NetBeans.  You will appreciate it more than Eclipse.  In the worst case scenario that Netbeans is no longer supported you will be a much better developer by the time it has reached its end of life (i dont think this will happen though).   Eclipse is better than Netbeans IMHO even though eclipse doesn't allow you to create GUI. If NetBeans seem better for your needs  go with it. I prefer Eclipse but it's just a personal choice. Even if in the future NetBeans will be no longer supported you'll still be able to use it or you'll maybe prefer to start using a another IDE. Java code remain java code no matter of the IDE. I believe that NetBeans will remain supported even under Oracle reign. Since there's a lot of Java developer using it Oracle won't tell all of them to go away. You worry too much. So what if Oracle discontinues NetBeans next month? Your installation still works and will for a long time. Just keep the installer in case you have to set up a new computer. Later you can still make a switch to another IDE. Should Oracle discontinue NetBeans (or threaten to) surely most other IDEs will offer an ""Import NetBeans project"" option."

417,svn - How to Integrate TortoiseSVN with Eclipse IDE? ,I have always used  instead of Notepad++. I did a checkout to my SVN repository with TortoiseSVN and now I want to import the SVN project (a >) into Eclipse and commit files to SVN repository directly from Eclipse IDE.How can i accomplish this? Thanks for help!You need to install an SVN Plugin. I would recommend Subversive you can find it in the Eclipse Marketplace ( and configure your SVN repository. Now you can make all SVN operations directly from Eclipse and there is no need to use TortoiseSVN anymore. The easiest is to use a SVN plugin for eclipse such as Subclipse - . Once installed you would not have any dependency to TortoiseSVN.  Also note that if you wish to use both Subclipse and TortoiseSVN on the same files on your file system your working copy format version supported by the respective clients must be the same. There is a plugin which allows simple usage of Tortoise SVN (and also Beyond Compare) in Eclipse: The 2 Phase Installation instructions are provided in the Eclipse site which I followed to install Tortoise SVN in my Eclipse Luna.I followed the Phase I - Option 1 and Phase 2 which worked well for me. 
422,iced coffeescript - IDE for IcedCoffeeScript programming? ,What IDE can I use to develop IcedCoffeeScript code with syntax highlight and intellisense?  I tried to use Webstorm but it does not support IcedCoffeeScript.You can't have more than syntax checking/coloring and snippets with (iced)CoffeeScript (on any IDE) because the way the language operate. So intellisense is out of game. Many environments supports autocomplete who can help. note: all editors can have different kinds of autocomplete features with or without packages(extensions).
424,c# - Delegates and VisualStudio IDE ,I have the following code on a control of my own: I thought the IDE would recognize this delegate and allow me to choose a suitable already implemented function or create a new one if I wanted just like it does to events although at least at first glance that does not seem to be the case. Is there a way to set a function to a delegate through the IDE?no there is not use event if you want to use that feature
425,cross compiling - Multiple IDE project files ,We are currently working in a team where we use both Visual Studio and Code::Blocks is there a way to replicate changes between those project files? So if one adds a file to the project file it will also get adjusted in the project file of the other IDE? Please note: We want our project to work on multiple IDE's platforms and compilers. Thus a general solution is welcome too.I assume you're using a VCS? If so my intuition would be to write a script that syncs up your project files (based on modification date?) and run it as a checkin hook if any of the project files are changed in the commit. . CMake uses it's own syntax (which is fairly complex though still easier than autotools in my opinion) which is used with project file generators which supports make visual studio codeblocks eclipse and possibly others.  It also has a installer generator which can make NSIS installers Mac OS X bundles and debian/red hat packages (and again possibly others) which I find quite useful.

430,python - IDE for pyglet? ,I'm starting to code with  but it seems not to like pyglet. So what would be a convenient way to code / run pyglet in Windows? What is your minimal development setup? Short of obvious minimal setups such as running code on Console2 or using IDLE.have you looked at  (there is also a free community edition). Among other helpful features (debugger version control etc) it provides viewing images inside the IDE which is especially useful when it comes to game programming.
432,C++ IDE detecting syntax errors without recompilation? ,I work on Code::Blocks IDE on Windows. Great amount of time is wasted for code recompilation to find errors.Is there a C++ IDE that detects syntax errors without recompilation? I suppose any clang-based IDE would be an option?Microsoft Visual Studio with it's IntelliSense. You'd be surprised at how efficient Qt Creator is at detecting C++ errors before compilation. Give it a try! Eclipse has that awesome feature for Java but IIRC the CDT framework is not as powerful: it detects only vague syntax errors. Microsoft's VisualStudio which is available for free with the Express edition is very good if you are on Windows. Apple's XCode is pretty good but it gives up after only one error it's error messages are very short and cryptic and I believe it is only available on Mac OS X. Unfortunately I do not know of an IDE with this support for Linux. Configure code blocks to work with clang. Working fine for me.
435,c# - Efficient IDE tools for F#? ,I recently initiated my first F# project using Visual Studio 2012. I was rather surprised (or more precisely disappointed) at the lack of IDE support for F#. For example the classic Ctrl-r Ctrl-r shortcut for refactor rename appears to be completely absent. I installed the F# powertools extension which does provide some support for this - but apparently only supports renaming in the F# part of the solution and not e.g. C# parts of the solution (the solution contains both F# and C# projects). Are there extensions to Visual Studio which provides cross-language refactor rename functionality? In general as a slightly loose question what kind of IDE and/or IDE extensions do people find efficient for F# programming? I'm so used to the efficient VS2012 refactoring support for C# that I can't help to find its absence a considerable blow to efficient use of F#...

439,java - Terminal based IDE ,I'm looking for a IDE that supports java and is based over terminal. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and it doesn't have any gui installed and I'd prefer to keep it that way. However I'd also like to code on it and connect to it from other computers using SSH to code on there to provide a lightweight and fast IDE. It has to be able to edit compile and test Java on the spot and more languages if possible. It would be nice if it had support for multiple projects and had a collapsible project browser like in netbeans and most IDE's. Does anyone know anything that meets the requirements? I'd love something like  however thats only for android. is the only example I can think of. You might be able to get along with vim but there will be a lot of  shell calls.

448,e commerce - JetBrains IDE with Demandware ,I was wondering if anyone has used Demandware with any of JetBrains IDE. I've always just used text editors and the Terminal. It seems like Demandware UX Studio is only for Eclipse? Any help or suggestions is much appreciated.In theory you can use your editor of choice to edit Demandware ISML files and DW Script files such as Sublime or JetBrains but you would need some kind of WebDAV-Sync solution to automatically upload your files to the server.  You'll also lose debugging when you move away from Eclipse. Editing pipelines will also be quite challenging as you won't have the visual IDE to edit the files (which are basically just XML). Fortunately there has been some movement in the community and a plugin has been created for Jetbrains it is available here:

ThanksFinally i got solution of above question   1- Copy the plugin.jar from DexGuard's eclipse directory to the dropins directory of your Eclipse install 2- Then u go to Windows --&gt; Preferences --&gt;Android(In side) --&gt; obfuscation(DexGuard)--&gt; Enable Obfuscation 3- Typically dexguard does the process automatically but if you need any specific proguarding tasks. Write it into the dexguard-project.txt  file.
456,Is there a reason to have both Eclipse IDE for Java and also Eclipse IDE for Java EE? ,"I've recently downloaded the Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers (for web apps development). Does it make sense to delete my ""regular"" Eclipse IDE for Java developers? I mean is there a feature in the regular IDE which isn't included in the EE IDE?  (I also use eclipse for Python programming with the Pydev plugin). The different ""editions"" of the eclipse IDE are basically just a different set of plugins on top of the basic eclipse platform. So if anything is missing you can alyways install those plugins when you need them. Yes it is a super-set. Also have you tried ? It has better GUI better javadoc support and it is way cooler to use! (and free) Not everyone needs the EE tools (mainly WTP - web tools platform); they may only be doing client apps or writing eclipse plugins."
457,apache flex - Flash Developer IDE ,I was wondering which IDE choice you flash developer use to write the code....I use Flex Builder for my AS3 only project so the code below will display nicely with coloring keywords. I wanted to know if there are better choices there...Also does flash developer do the AS3 programming only? Do they do graphic design at all? Thanks for the reply...I really suggest you to use FlashDevelop as your default IDE. This program is a lot lighter than Flash Builder (which is built on Eclipse).
458,Selenium IDE testing all links ,"I'm trying to use Selenium IDE to test a web app. On one page there are several links which trigger modal windows. I'd like to test ALL the links on the page to ensure that ALL cause modals to pop up. Each link has a class ""modal"" so I thought I could just change the target value in IDE  but that finds only the first link. I've found a few solutions but they use Selenium RC with Java/Python and those can't be directly translated to the IDE. I understand the IDE is not as powerful but I'm setting this up for a non-programmer to use and up till now it's been really simple for them.i had to read up a lot and i want to thank @ohaal and @aleh for their inputs. i used their suggested links as well as some more external reading to reach the solution like so: i'm not selecting any one answer as all of them contributed to the final solution.  Use a while loop and this XPath expression as a locator:  and so on should point to the links you're after. See ): Insert your assertions and probably pop-ups closings before last command (gotoIf)."
459,configuration - configure an eclipse based IDE ,I am new to programming. In fact this is my first job  and it has been just a month. I work for a company who use Savvion as BPM tool to automate some process. It has an Eclipse based IDE. The way it works is that  we can map business process using worksteps and linking those work steps.  My question is how to configure that eclipse based IDE so that it automatically puts some code when ever i tried to create a new workstep in the process. I am learning new things and I do not know where to start. I have gone through the folders where the IDE is installed and all I can find is jar files. could you please guide me as to where to start looking and any tips to get started. Thank you.you can use BPM studio (An Eclipse version savvion provided) where you can build process template as well as customize existing one.
460,c++ - IDE showing blank console ,"It's been days since I try to make my IDE (Code::Blocks version 13.12 I tried on 10.05 too) work. Any program (including a simple Hello World! program) I would make would show a black console showing nothing but an "" _ "". I have made an exception in my antivirus (Avast!) for the file containing the IDE) but the same thing happens . I have tried re-installing twice i have tried resetting the compiler and debugger's settings to default auto-detecting toolchain executables but the same thing happens. I have tried rebooting my computer several times same thing happens.I would like to know what I can do to solve this problem  because I don't want to get another complicated compiler (I am a beginner)  as Code::Blocks fits my needs perfectly. The following codes produces a blank console:I had the same exact problem with Eclipse Visual Studio and then with Code::Blocks (I tested them all). I suggest you follow this video tutorial after you confirm the problem persists with a second IDE :  . It will take you step by step on how to install a given compiler."
464,java - How does IDE show method parameter names? ,I am writing a java program with an open source library using Eclipse and I am observing my IDE suggestions as follows. I added the library to my project by importing jar from IDE.  As you can see in the image it shows me parameter names as srg0 arg1.. However in the source code of the library in github it uses different variable names such as P N r. I have observed in some cases IDE shows the same name that is used in the source. I am curious on how IDE shows parameter name in such cases. How does the IDE pick parameter names to show here?Either the references class would have had to be compiled using the -parameter compiler flag (see )Or you need to attach the source of the library to the library jar
479,VB6 IDE crashes after application terminates ,"Several developers on my team have this problem. We can run our app in the IDE fine but when we eventually quit the app >. The crash takes the form of  ""Visual Basic has stopped working""  It doesn't matter if we quit our app nicely or force-stop it in the debugger; same result (crashed IDE). The exit sequence for the app is: User selects 'exit' from a menu  Menu event handler calls . We tend to run a group file with a 5-6 projects in it. This error sometimes seems to go away other times it occurs seemingly randomly. I don't know what factor influences this. If we don't actually run the app just the IDE then it works fine and we can quit the IDE itself normally. Anyone seen this before? Any ideas? Thanks!This is most definately caused by leaks of VB6 objects that are involved in subclassing/hooking and not only these. What we did to get rid of these crashes was to instrument all of our classes (including forms user controls designers and anything that can be instantiated) with  debug print statement the call-stack shows you exactly the offenting property of the offending UC. I believe  is correct in its technical assessment of the cause of the problem. But it may also be useful to briefly describe the procedure I used to narrow down the source lines of code. In my case this problem appeared to be TOTALLY random so it was hard to know where to start. My approach was not rocket science - more brute force. Essentially I used a binary search to rule in/out sections of code. First step was to comment out the entire startup procedure so that the app would start as an empty shell; this demonstrated that the problem went away (null result). Following that I recursively commented in roughly half the code testing for the problem each time. Each block was evaluated as a boolean - it either did or did not cause the problem. Then proceed again in the block not ruled out. Eventually (and more quickly than I anticipated) this led to a single line of code which accessed a property of a third-party control."
482,node.js - Javascript IDE errors ,I'm not sure how to to explain this problem so I can't really find any solutions on Google. I am new to the whole Javascript world and its technologies. I am using NodeJS + Express + Jade to make a web application I got this project from my colleague. But somehow my IDE keeps saying statement or expression expected everywhere. Your IDE linter for javascript doesn't understand recent javascript features like arrow functions. Make sure your IDE supports Ecmascript 6.
487,javascript - IDE for Jquery development ,What do you suggest for JQuery development IDE. Is there something similar to Eclipse for java so I can run/debug my application in it? Im getting a lot of work based on JQuery Widget and JQuery UI. I'm working on Fedora.I'm using netbeans. It has quite a good JS Editor and works sometimes well with jQuery but has not all functions integrated and can't suggest the params right - but i don't know any IDE who can do this For editing use debugger tools in modern browsers like chrome ;)
491,Autoformat Javascript in Netbeans IDE ,Are there any known Plugins or ways to properly autoformat Javascript in Netbeans IDE? After looking into this further I have found that the javascript module is being rewritten already(much needed).  You can finally find formatting options for javascript.  It's available in the netbeans nightly builds.  Good luck all.    You have to use an alternate key for now.  I'm working on modifying the Javascript language in Netbeans to possibly release something better later on(either as a plugin or patch).  I'm still familiarizing myself with the way things are happening in Netbeans.   There have been talks for years to add more formatting options for Javascript in Netbeans.  Nothing has surfaced.  I'm going to propose that the Javascript language leverage JSBeautify(running in Rhino) to provide formatting rather then implementing new features in Java.  This simplifies the formatting process plus the JSBeautify community is very large and it's actively developed.
492,Which IDE support LESS (Dynamic Stylesheet Language)? ,"If someone here knows which IDE support LESS? There are many problems when I'm working on it. If I make a mistake the  won't render my LESS CSS; that why I need IDE to correct some of my errors.. I haven't tried it so I'm not sure what ""first class support"" means. Intellij IDEA with plugin LESSand another plugin ""LESS CSS Compiler""you can compile CSS in real timewhen you edit LESS file the CSS is already output."
493,eclipse - Fast and interactive PHP IDE? ,"  Could you recommend me a PHP IDE? I've tried Notepad++ (a great text editor but.. just a text editor) and NetBeans. I've worked with Eclipse on Java too. I like NetBeans but like Eclipse it is so damn slow. Recently it started lagging every 3 seconds or so.. Most important features are: Auto-tab auto-completion of opened functions HTML tags syntax highlight auto-generation of comments for functions function and class hints (it should be able to ""look"" into my classes and their methods like NetBeans). So basicaly I am looking for a NetBeans-like lightweight text editor :) Any ideas?I haven't tried it myself but I've heard many people raving about  which I would describe as a lightweight IDE.  It's not as feature-laden as Netbeans/Eclipse but is quickly to its set with every update. vim on the other hand is as lightweight as it gets but by default probably doesn't have all the goodies you're looking for.  However if you're willing to spend the time configing and installing plugins you can make it whatever you want. I'd go for Netbeans but since you don't want it most programmers praised (and still praise)EMACS . Emacs is available for every platform. Some people consider it to be the best. Truth is that it is very fast auto-completion of your code and many other features. It takes a few days to get used to the powerful shortcuts but once you're done with it I guess you'll find it very smooth. You only need to install the application and activate the PHP plugin (or else if needed). Hope this helped. I have moved from Netbeans to PHPStorm and quite satisfied by features you can automate and so far it is much smarter on guessing what I'm typing.In my opinion Netbeans is more about Java programming and PHP feature behave as a little addon.Before Netbeans I was playing with PHPDesigner also nice and fast IDE for a reasonable price."
