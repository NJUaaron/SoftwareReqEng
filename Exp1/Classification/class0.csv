3,vim - Why should I use an IDE? ,"In another question  speaks highly of IDEs saying ""some people still just dont know ""why"" they should use one..."".  As someone who uses vim for programming and works in an environment where most/all of my colleagues use either vim or emacs for all of their work what are the advantages of IDEs?  Why should I use one? I'm sure this is a charged issue for some people and I'm not interested in starting a flame war so .  I'm not interested in hearing about why I shouldn't use an IDE; I already don't use one.  I'm interested in hearing from ""the other side of the fence"" so to speak. If you think that IDEs may be suitable for some types of work but not others I'm also interested to hear why.It really depends on what language you're using but in C# and Java I find IDEs beneficial for: All of these save time. They're things I could do manually but with more pain: I'd rather be coding. Code completion. It helps a lot with exploring code. The short answer as to why I use an IDE is laziness. I'm a lazy soul who doesn't like to do things a difficult way when there is an easy way to do it instead. IDE's make life easy and so appeal to us lazy folk. As I type code the IDE automatically checks the validity of the code I can highlight a method and hit F1 to get help right click and select ""go to to definition"" to jump straight to where it is defined. I hit one button and the application with debugger automatically attached is launched for me. And so the list goes on. All the things that a developer does on a day to day basis is gathered under one roof. There is no need to use an IDE. It is just much harder work not to. I don't think it's fair to do the classic ""text editor and console window vs IDE"" when ""text editor"" is really emacs. Most features that are typical for IDE:s are also in emacs. Or perhaps they even originated there and modern IDE:s are mainly interface improvements/simplifications. This means that for the original question the answer is not so clear-cut. It depends on > power of Vim using something like the  and Emacs fulfil many functions any IDE will give you. The only aspect they do not handle that a larger IDE may are things like UI designers. Then your question boils down to simply ""what IDE should I use"" with arguments to be made for the simpler realm of Vim and Emacs. For me an IDE is better because it allows faster navigation in code which is important if you have something in your mind to implement.Supposed you do not use an IDE it takes longer to get to the destination. Your thoughts may be interupted more often. It means more clicks/more keys have to be pressed.One has to concentrate more on the thought how to implement things.Of course you can write down things too but then one must jump between the design and implementation.Also a GUI designer makes a big difference. If you do that by hand it may take longer. GUI-based IDEs like Visual Studio and Eclipse have several advantages over text-based IDEs like Emacs or vim because of their display capabilities: Basically with a GUI-based IDE you can get more useful information on screen at once and you can view/edit graphical portions of of your application as easily as text portions. One of the coolest things to experience as a developer is editing a method that computes some data and seeing the live output of your code displayed graphically in another window just as your user will see it when you run the app.  Now that's WYSIWYG editing! Text-based IDEs like Emacs and vim can add features like code completion and refactoring over time so in the long run their main limitation is their text-based display model. I also almost exclusively use Vim (almost because I'm trying to learn emacs now) for all my development stuff. I think sheer intuitiveness (from the GUI of course) is the primary reason why people like to use IDEs. By being intuitive little to no learning overhead of the tool is required. The lesser the learning overhead the more they can get work done. An  allows one to work faster and more easily... I noticed I spent a lot of time navigating in the code in a simple text editor... In a good IDE that time goes down if the IDE supports jumping to functions to previous editing positionto variables... Also a good IDE reduces the time to experiment with different language features and projects as the start-up time can be small. A couple of reasons I can think of for using an IDE: And quite frankly I like my mouse. When I use pure text-based editors it gets lonely. Saves time to developMakes life easier by providing features like Integrated debugging intellisense. There are lot many but will recommend to use one they are more than obvious. I'm not sure there's a clear dividing line between a text editor and an IDE. You have the likes of Notepad at one end of the scale and the best modern IDEs at the other but there are a lot of thing in between. Most text editors have syntax highlighting; editors aimed at programmers often have various other features such as easy code navigation and auto complete. Emacs even lets you integrate a debugger. The IDEs of even ten years ago had far less features to help programmers than you'd expect of a serious text editor these days. My main  reason to use one is when the code goes beyond 100 files. Although ctags can do the work  have a pretty good way to navigate the files easily an super fast. It saves time when you have a lot of work to do. To me it's just the the GUI version of everything we did in the good old days of the terminal. I will always agree that IDE are not very superior because they hide a lot of stuff especially concerning the linking stuff but they have a notable advantage in some cases for example with certain development platforms like Qt. Some IDE like visual of others even seem to parse your code as you type it and detect errors before you even compile: it seems logics that only an IDE can work closely with a compiler to immediately detect problem in the typed source. My wild answer that the IDE/Command-line flame war exists is just because the C/C++ executable building is not very well handled from a standardized point of view unlike with the D language; every platform handles compiling/linking/etc its own way so to make it less messy they make an IDE. From your viewpoint it might be more simple to use the command-line if there would have been only one compiler with standard options it would have been easy but the truth is C/C++ is flexible so in the end all platform do it their own way hence the IDE to not waste explaining how to do it. If you can learn how an executable talks to the kernel or if you know anything about compiler design maybe there is a way to work with a proper command-line but I doubt you have. Microsoft or Apple all evil they would be have to propose a straight-forward way to build application without entering in the details and since building an application depends directly on the architecture of the OS it will hardly be ""standard"" as the command-line is. To put it simple big and complex applications where you don't want to dig too deep into what it does -&gt; IDE little pieces of software or simple system software-design -&gt; command-line. Except of course those nifty libraries that embed a Makefile but that's another story. Also I think IDE are used when the application delivered has something to do with ironically a GUI or something that has an interface or is directly bound to an OS so again it's also for people who will use a UI/GUI without knowing how it works while people who will program systems won't need it all. IDE is just modern shit but I think in 100 years the command-line will still exist. I like an IDE because it puts a lot of functionality at my fingertips.  Editing/Compilation/visibility of files in the project are all things I value in an IDE.  I use Visual Studio now but in a former life I used SlickEdit and found that it made my development process more streamlined than when I wasn't using it. There's only one thing to consider when deciding whether to use an IDE or not and that's whether it makes you more productive or not. Short question so short answer :) It depends highly on what you're doing and what language you're doing it in.  Personally I tend to not use an IDE (or ""my IDE consists of 3 xterms running vim one running a database client and one with a bash prompt or tailing logs"" depending on how broadly you define ""IDE"") for most of my work but if I were to find myself developing a platform-native GUI then I'd reach for a language-appropriate IDE in an instant - IMO IDEs and graphical form editing are clearly made for each other."
18,macos - C++ IDE for Macs ,I teach a C++ course using Visual Studio.  One of my students has a Mac and was looking for an IDE to use on his machine. What would be good to recommend? library. It's the one I use. Another (albeit non-free) option is to install VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop on the Mac and run Windows with Visual Studio in a VM. This works really pretty well.  The downsides are: The upside is that you and the student don't need to hassle with differences in the IDE that may not be accounted for in your instruction materials. If you are looking for a full-fledged IDE like Visual StudioI think Eclipse might be your best bet. Eclipse is also highly extensible and configurable. See here:  is free and good which is lucky because it's pretty much the only option on the Mac.
22,java - 'Must Override a Superclass Method' Errors after importing a project into Eclipse ,"Anytime I have to re-import my projects into Eclipse (if I reinstalled Eclipse or changed the location of the projects)  of my overridden methods are not formatted correctly causing the error: The method must override a superclass method It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects - for whatever reason the method argument values are not always populated so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance: will be initially populated like this: The odd thing is if I remove my code and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method it uses the same argument names I already had so I don't really know where the problem is other then it auto-formatting the method for me. This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it .. I would be very happy. Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods which are inside an argument of another method?Eclipse is defaulting to Java 1.5 and you have classes implementing interface methods (which in Java 1.6 can be annotated with . No idea why but this will solve it. This is my second time encounter this problem.first time according the alphazero's recommendation it worked.but in the second time I set to 1.6 it don't work it just like 'CACHE' this error after clean and rebuild. Try to switch off 'Build Automatically' as Rollin_s said -&gt; error still here! So I removed the problem project (already set to 1.6) from Package Explorer and import it again -&gt; it start a rebuild and no error this time Hope this help someone Fixing  must override a super class method error is not difficult You just need to change Java source version to 1.6 because from Java 1.6 @Override annotation can be used along with interface method. In order to change source version to 1.6 follow below steps : In my case this problem happened when I imported a Maven project into Eclipse. To solve this I added the following in : Then in the context menu of the project go to ""Maven -&gt; Update Project ..."" and press OK. That's it. Hope this helps. In my case none the solutions above works. I have to checkout my source code to another folder. From eclipse select File &gt; Switch workSpaces &gt; Other... and then import code to the new workspaces. it works after that.   This happens when your maven project uses different Compiler Compliance level and Eclipse IDE uses different Compiler Compliance level. In order to fix this we need to change the Compiler Compliance level of Maven project to the level IDE uses. 1) To See Java Compiler Compliance level uses in Eclipse IDE  *) Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Compiler Compliance level : 1.8 (or 1.7 1.6  ect)  2) To Change Java Compiler Compliance level of Maven project *) Go to  ""Project"" -&gt;  ""Properties"" -&gt; Select ""Java Compiler"" -&gt; Change the Compiler Compliance level : 1.8 (or 1.7 1.6  ect)  "
33,Which Android IDE is better - Android Studio or Eclipse? ,I'm starting to develop for Android. Which IDE should I use - Android Studio or Eclipse sdk?I would like to know which one is better.Working with Eclipse can be difficult at times probably when debugging and designing layouts Eclipse sometimes get stuck and we have to restart Eclipse from time to time. Also you get problems with emulators.  Android studio was released very recently and this IDE is not yet heavily used by developers. Therefore it may contain certain bugs.  This describes the difference between android android studio and eclipse project structure:  The use of IDE is your personal preference.But personally if I had to choose Eclipse is a widely known trusted and certainly offers more features then Android Studio.Android Studio is a little new right now. May be it's upcoming versions keep up to Eclipse level soon. Both are equally good. With Android Studio you have ADT tools integrated and with eclipse you need to integrate them manually. With Android Studio it feels like a tool designed from the outset with Android development in mind.Go ahead they have same features. From the Android Studio download page: Caution: Android Studio is currently available as an early access preview. Several features are either incomplete or not yet implemented and you may encounter bugs. If you are not comfortable using an unfinished product you may want to instead download (or continue to use) the ADT Bundle (Eclipse with the ADT Plugin). My first choice is  which I just finished. It shows you exactly how to use all the features of Eclipse that are useful for developing Android apps. There's also a brief section on getting set up to develop from the command line and from other IDEs.
38,What is the best IDE for C Development / Why use Emacs over an IDE? ,"so as per one of my previous questions I'm brushing up on my C skills.  Thanks for posting links which answer some of my questions but I guess what I'm really wondering about is: Whether learning to edit using emacs / vim and compiling / debugging using the gcc-toolchain is worth it instead of just using an IDE and why? What are peoples reasons for not migrating to an IDE? Has anyone moved from terminal-centric development to IDE development and why did they move?I started off by using IDEs Microsoft or not. Then while working on QNX some long time ago I was forced to do with a text editor + compiler/linker. Now I prefer this simple combination––a syntax highlighting editor + C compiler and linker cli + make––to any IDEs even if environment allows for them. The reasons are for me: it's everywhere. If you program in C you do have the compiler and usually you can get yourself an editor. The first thing I do––I get myself nedit on Linux or Notepad++ on Windows. I would go with vi but GUI editors provide for a better fonts and that is important when you look at code all day you can program remotely via ssh when you need to. And it does help a lot sometimes to be able to ssh into the target and do some quick things there it keeps me close to CLI preferably UNIX/Linux CLI. So all the commands are on my fingertips and when I need them I don't have to go read a reference book. And UNIX CLI can do things IDEs often can't––because their developers didn't think you'd need them most importantly it is very much like seeing the Matrix in raw code. I operate files so I'm forced to keep them manageable. I'm finding things in my code manually which makes me keep it simple and organized. I do Config Management explicitly so I know when I'm synced and how. I know my Makefiles because I write them and they only do what I tell them to (if you wonder if that works in ""really big projects""––it does work and the bigger the project the more performance it gains me) when people ask me to look at their code I don't have to learn the IDE they use I've moved from a terminal text-editor+make environment to Eclipse for most of my projects. Spanning from C and C++ to Java and Python to name few languages I am currently working with. The reason was simply productivity. I could not afford spending time and effort on keeping all projects ""in my head"" as other things got more important.  There are benefits of using the ""hardcore"" approach (terminal) - such as that you have a much thinner layer between yourself and the code which allows you to be a bit more productive when you're all ""inside"" the project and everything is on the top of your head. But I don't think it is possible to defend that way of working just for it's own sake when your mind is needed elsewhere. Usually when you work with command line tools you will frequently have to solve a lot of boilerplate problems that will keep you from being productive. You will need to know the tools in detail to fully leverage their potentials. Also maintaining a project will take a lot more effort. Refactoring will lead to updates in make-files etc. To summarize: If you only work on one or two projects preferably full-time without too much distractions ""terminal based coding"" can be more productive than a full blown IDE. However if you need to spend your thinking energy on something more important an IDE is definitely the way to go in order to keep productivity. Make your choice accordingly. Emacs >. I have used Eclipse with the CDT plug in quite successfully. Emacs would be better if it had a text editor in it... :-) Use . Crossplatform as it is 100% pure Java. Not the fastest IDE on earth but for Java actually very fast very flexible not that nice looking though. Both have very sophisticated code folding syntax highlighting (for all languages you can think of!) and are very flexible regarding configuring it for you personal needs. jEdit is BTW very easy to extend to add whatever feature you may need there (it has an ultra simple scripting language that looks like Java but is actually ""scripted""). If you're on Windows then it's a total no-brainer: Get Visual C++ Express."
47,What's a good IDE for Erlang programming? ,"As far as I know there's Erlang plugin for NetBeans and Eclipse. Which one has the upper hand at the moment?  Are there any other IDE for Erlang which I didnt mention and how good are they when compare with NetBeans and Eclipse? The best IDE for Erlang is Emacs. However the mode which ships with Erlang isn't the best. ). Pros:Syntax highlight autocompletion and suggestion all work well.During suggest it will display some documentationif available: very useful when exploring a module. Error and warning annotiations are quick and helpful. All things considered the user experience is good especially if you are used to eclipse. Cons:Erlide can also run your modules but I find the shell is too clunky to be usable. I always keep a ""real"" erlang shell open and compile/test my code from there. There is also a Textmate bundle (google) but I have not tried that yet. Erlang mode in Emacs is the generally recommended IDE.  and Vimthey are good enough for developing.Geany can also compile and run the code. . I'm using sublime text on windows mac and linux Emacs or VIM is not a good choice if you didn't have experience on them.There a too many bugs in Eclipse...And IntelliJ IDEA is the best IDE"
51,testing - Online IDE for Python ,Is there any web-based IDE that I can use to run quick tests? There're a dozen for PHP and some for even Java but I haven't found yet that runs Python. If there's an  that'd be better. ThanksYou might want to give a try at: These aren't full IDEs but there are a lot of options for online python interpreters: I'm trying out  is good too. I'm pretty sure that IDE's are the last kind of programs that will ever go web based because a good IDE needs to be so extremely interactive if it wants to be good. I really don't see a reason for this and others seem to agree because there isn't any.And no an interactive web shell or compiler has nothing to do with an IDE.  
56,clang-based cross-platform C++ IDE? ,The  C++ compiler claims to be built for among other things better IDE integration by providing an API for the IDE to use for tasks such as parsing the code. So are there are any good C++ IDE's that use clang to provide features such as semantic highlighting refactoring and finding and showing semantic errors in real-time? I've been using Eclipse CDT but its C++ parser is full of imperfections that cause the IDE to report a lot of annoying false positive errors in the code. I would like to have an IDE that reports an error if and only if the compiler would report the same error hence my interest in an IDE that's built on a compiler's internals. I'm primarily interested in cross-platform IDE's although I wouldn't mind knowing about single-platform ones for Windows or Linux (so  Xcode).Qt Creator is basing their next-gen code parsing and associated functionality on Clang:  Clearly advertises libclang backend as a main feature.

61,Python documentator IDE guiding ,Suppose I have such function: In my case the IDE has no way to know what goes in there.How I tell it by using comments? In case of PHP i've used something like this Another use case is when I know that in some case some proxy will return some objectIDE has no chance to know but I know for sure and want to specify this by comment to help myself in future and to help IDE. In PHP while using PhpStorm I would do following: How can I achieve same behavior with PyCharm specificaly and python documentators in common?Use a  see the following pseudo code: I am not sure if it will work in PyCharm (I don't use it) - but for Python 3  were added. You can put those into the definition of a function: Maybe PyCharm will use this to define which methods are available on someobject.  After a small test I guess this should work (which is pretty awesome).
62,Disconnect other IDE instances in Cloud9 IDE ,I was wondering if there's a way to disconnect other IDE instances in Cloud9 IDE because I left C9 IDE on at work and I have the code highlighted which makes it hard to work with when I get home.There's currently no way to remotely disconnect other collaborators (which you became once you opened your workspace on multiple tabs) but you could disable collaboration altogether by adding  to the IDE URL which should remove the code highlighting.
75,"ide - How do I ""Add Existing Item"" an entire directory structure in Visual Studio? ","I have a free standing set of files not affiliated with any C# project at all that reside in a complicated nested directory structure. I want to add them in that format to a different directory in an ASP.NET web application I am working on; while retaining the same structure. So I copied the folder into the target location of my project and I tried to “add existing  item” only to lose the previous folder hierarchy. Usually I have re-created the directories by hand copied across on a one-to-one basis and then added existing items. There are simply too many directories/items in this case. So how do you add existing directories and files in Visual Studio 2008?Drag the files / folders from Windows Explorer into the Solution Explorer. It will add them all. Note this doesn't work if Visual Studio is in Administrator Mode because Windows Explorer is a User Mode process. Enable > This is what I do: Then everything will be added on your solution from folders to files and files inside those folders. A neat trick I discovered is that if you go to ""Add existing..."" you can drag the folder from the open dialog to your solution. I have my Visual Studio to open in Admin Mode automatically so this was a good workaround for me as I didn't want to have to undo that just to get this to work. There is now an open-source extension in the Marketplace that seems to do what the OP was asking for:  If it doesn't do exactly what you want the code is available so you can modify it to suit your scenario. HTH What worked for me was to drag the folder into Visual Studio then right click the folder and select ""Open Folder in File Explorer"". Then select all and drag them into the folder in Visual Studio. In Windows 7 you could do the following: Right click on your project and select ""Add-&gt;Existing Item"". In the dialog which appears browse to the root of the directory you want to add. In the upper right corner you have a search box. Type  whatever the type of files you want to add. After the search finishes select all files click Add and wait for a while... The cleanest way that I've found to do this is to create a new Class Library project in the target folder and redirect all of its build output elsewhere.  It still leaves a .csproj file sitting in that folder but it does let you see it in Visual Studio and pick which files to include in your project. It's annoying that Visual Studio doesn't support this natively but CMake could generate the Visual Studio project as a work around. Other than that just use Qt Creator. It can then export a Visual Studio project."
81,Difference between IDE and Framework ,What is a difference between an IDE and Framework with respect to Java?Basically : Quoting wikipedia an  : is a software application that  provides comprehensive facilities to  computer programmers for software  development. An IDE normally consists  of: While a  : is an abstraction in which common code  providing generic functionality can be  selectively overridden or specialized  by user code thus providing specific  functionality. Frameworks are a  special case of software libraries in  that they are reusable abstractions of  code wrapped in a well-defined  Application programming interface  (API) yet they contain some key  distinguishing features that separate  them from normal libraries. An IDE is an application used to write and compile code.  A framework is generally a software component that someone else wrote that you can use/integrate into your own project generally to avoid re-inventing the wheel. A framework is a tool that is closely attached to the language you are using and usually extends upon or adds the the language features. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) provides automation support for the language you use with regards to syntax highlighting of keywords errors building projects cleaning them intgegration with VCS etc. and usually provides default support for popular frameworks used for your language. Java makes use of frameworks like Hibernate Struts and Spring to extend the language and NetBeans or Intellij IDEA bring support for these tools to your Java project in a structured manor. As per all answers I can come to a conclusion that Visual Studio is an IDE and .NET is a framework.And also a framework(list of .dll) can be integrated into an IDE. Mean framework is a part of an IDE.
87,Recommendations on PHP IDE ,"  I have been a .NET developer for years but may need to work on a PHP project soon. What editor/IDE should I use? ThanksPaulEclipse PDT seems to be a good choice basically it's a ""everything"" rolled package. Netbeans have been more and more supportive of PHP so it might be a good choice too. I'm no PHP expert by any means but went through the same question about 6 months back. .Net developer background deciding to do some PHP work on the side. I ended up using Eclipse for PHP developers which as far as I know is the core Eclipse application with additional plug-ins meant specifically for PHP development. For the most part I'm happy with it. The thing I miss most though is a nice auto-formatter for code the way  does in Visual Studio.  Eclipse does format it but not in a fashion I'm partial towards. Best of luck in your search though I'm sure you'll get plenty of recommendations.  apart from eclipse and netbeans there is geany. its fast and light but has only basic features of an ide."
95,IDE for Grinder scripting ,I'm looking for a IDE for the Grinder framework 3.11. Can someone please suggest me an IDE to develop and run Grinder(3.11) scripts. Grinder-stone for eclipse is no longer supported. Unfortunately there are no good IDE options today for doing fully-integrated Grinder script development.  Nothing has come along to fill Grinderstone's shoes.  Your best bet is to go with a decent Java/Python/Jython development tool such as PyDev or PyCharm or IntelliJ.  It won't have the Grinder integration but any of these tools will be helpful for everything else. I was in your shoes few days back however you need to configure pydev which will save a lot of time . You can integrated Grinder on your own by creating a bat file and giving the path of scripts to the one in eclipse . This worked for me.

102,java - JRE JDK and IDE revisited ,I know this question must've been asked alot of times already but I've got some specific questions that need answering to. The underlying question I am trying to ask here is . I understand that JRE has the run time libraries JDK contains the compiler/debugger and everything else that JRE has. IDE is my Eclipse.  : When exactly will I need just the JRE and nothing else? i.e. under what circumstances will only having JRE suffice. If I were to emulate such behaviour what are the necessary steps required. (> ) Thanks If all you want to do is run an already compiled Java program then a JRE is all you need. So if you were developing software for someone else you'd have JDK and IDE installed on your machine for development purposes but you'd only need to install the JRE on the client machine for them to be able to run it. Question 1 : If I am trying to develop something in Java is it  necessary that I need JDK for it? Because as I understand I can make  do with IDE + JRE. My IDE provides me with compiler/debugger and I  will refer the JRE from my IDE. So it should be alright right? As you said JDK is required for compilation and JRE is required for running the program. No matter who provides(IDE or system path) if you have those you should be able to compile and run your programs. Question 2 : From the above question is it safe to say that IDE  contains JDK in it already? You can't generalise the statement tha IDE contains JDK. Few does few may not. Question 3 : When exactly will I need just the JRE and nothing else?  i.e. under what circumstances will only having JRE suffice. If I were  to emulate such behaviour what are the necessary steps required. (I  can make it more clear if you have not understood it. ) If you have classes/jar with you. You can run them without needing JDK. Answering > java code.   Yes some IDEs like Eclpse ship jdk with the ide. The downside you can't use cmd prompt to execute java code.  You'll need JRE to run every applications thats been written in Java. When you will implement your project you'll have to setup JRE to your client in order for them to run it.
105,NetBeans IDE scaling on Windows 8/10 ,"I'm trying to run NetBeans under Windows 8.1 on a screen with a high DPI. Windows itself has scaling enabled to 400% and everything else looks just fine. However when I start NetBeans it runs as if there's no scaling enabled and I just see tiny little letters in the IDE. I did check the properties under which the IDE starts and they do have ""Enable scaling for this program"" checked. I could increase font size in the editor and the error log which would at least enable me to view what I'm typing on the screen however all menus side-bars panels etc remain very small which is very uncomfortable trying to work with. So any idea how I can make NetBeans scale with Windows 8.1? Currently using NetBeans 8.0.A workaround is to increase the font size of menu options. See: ).  The fix is quite simple: First set Windows to prefer external manifest files over internal ones (which was default until some Versions ago) by adding the key to Then create a manifest file (in this case netbeans64.exe.manifest or netbeans.exe.manifest) in the directory of the corresponding exe file with the following content: This way I also could fix Visual Studio 2013 and SQL Server Management Console 2012 which are only partly dpi aware (e.g. Visual Studio 2013 the form editor is unusable on 200% as the complete layout is broken). I fixed all my apps that were unusable or at least had a bad layout this way.  As this thread was the first one in my google results I thought it would be a good idea to post this solution although the last activity is quite long ago. Windows 10 does this for you now. Right click on your Netbeans shortcut (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\NetBeans) and select Properties. Go to the Compatibility tab and then select Change High DPI Settings. From there check the Override High DPI Scaling box and set it to System.  Similar to setting  if you use the Darcula plugin you can set the value for the ""Override Default Fonts"" option to 18. That has the same effect. Additionally if you change it to Segoe UI it matches Windows 10 nicely. go to display settings and change scale and layout to 100% Boom! :) Simply hold down the  then scroll up or down to zoom out or in"

Thanks.Let me just start out by saying that Eclipse is a > affordable (last I heard $50 for the distro plus a year of free upgrades). If you have the budget and need the added functionality I'd go with something like that. Anyway I've tried to be as detailed as I can. I hope this helps and good luck on your search! :) IntelliJ IDEA was awsome. Now it is just ""better than Eclipse"". You can code in IDEA several times faster than in Eclipse in my experience (I moved from being an Eclipse early-adopter to IDEA and haven't looked back) but IDEA has a number of flaws: I still wouldn't go back though; the code refactorings and intentions in IDEA are just too good. A major version of Eclipse came out a while back and it took me about an hour of searching on the website to figure out what was actually contained in the release which might persuade me back into the fold. Visit  to see how to sell an IDE! There is no best IDE. You make it as good as you get used using it. Eclipse can't remotely be called an IDE to my opinion. Okay that's exaggerated I know. It merely reflects my intense agony thanks to eclipse! Whatever you do it just doesn't work! You always need to fight with it to make it do things the right way. During that time you're not developing code which is what you're supposed to do right? eclipse and maven integration: unreliable! Eclipse and ivy integration: unreliable. WTP: buggy buggy buggy! Eclipse and wstl validation: buggy! It complains about not finding URL's out of the blue even though they do exist and a few days later without having changed them it suddenly does find them etc etc. I Could write a frakking book about it. To answer your question: NO ECLIPSE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE THE BEST IDE!!! IntelliJ is supposed to be MUCH better! Eclipse was the first IDE to move me off of XEmacs.  However when my employer offered to buy me a Intellij IDEA license if I wanted one it only took 3 days with an evaluation copy to convince me to go for it. It seems like so many small things are just nicer. IntelliJ is good one but its not free!!Then NetBeans is also a good option.Also if you are IBM suite WSAD is good I'd have to vote for Netbeans as the best one currently.  Eclipse is decent but right now Netbeans is better. I used IntelliJ for almost 5+ years (from v1.5 to v7) and around 8 months ago I migrated to IBM RAD (which is built on top of old eclipse platform) and around 3 months ago I settled down with Eclipse (Ganymede). I used IntelliJ on a mid size projects (with 10k classes) and I'm using Eclipse on one with just few hundreds of classes. I found both of these IDEs (IntelliJ and Eclipse) to be good. IBM RAD is just a waste of money (ofcourse one could be stuck in an IBM shop without choice). IntelliJ has far superior refactoring capabilities and keyboard shortcuts for most of the features compared to Eclipse. It supports importing projects from Eclipse. It has better built in xml handling capabilities (with refactorings applicable almost like for the java code). Built in Intelli Sense is also very good. Eclipse is a great tool and its free. It took me around 1-2 months to get used to Eclipse from IntelliJ (lot of unlearning of shortcuts) but I got hang of Eclipse it has been pretty smooth. I havent used Eclipse on mid size project. Both IntelliJ and Eclipse have active plugin communities and both integrate well with version control systems unit test frameworks application servers and profilers. IntelliJ started becoming slow and bloated starting from v4.0. It was slow with mid size projects. I would not use IntelliJ unless its performance can be improved. I havent used these two IDEs for anything other than java development. If you are a java developer and your company pays for IntelliJ and if your project is not too big go for it. Otherwise dont despair: Eclipse is always there. I gave Eclipse a 3 months ride at my new work but after that I found out that normal Maven project can be run in IntelliJ IDEA too (unless it's Eclipse plugin/EMF/something of course ;-)). 3 months are not enough to compare it with 8+ years with IDEA but it's enough to claim I gave it a fair try. I decided to live with its perspectives (other IDEs don't need them) with its poor debugger (doesn't show date values unless you click on them! etc.) with its comparatively worse completion than IDEA has. Now after all those years IDEA is also free (community edition) and I use it without much trouble. Of course I miss some of those ""Ultimate"" features of paid version but it's far better than Eclipse. Biggest difference is the whole mindset needed for both of these IDEs. But after you master the mindset of either I can't understand what can anyone hold to Eclipse - unless you need its plugin ecosystem or you have some serious investments there. Example of ""mindset"" differences: You have to save in Eclipse not in IDEA and I don't care what is better or worse - but you have to save in Eclipse to let him clean up underlined errors that are not errors anymore etc. ;-) You have to save there in order to get rid of errors in other files too because other file doesn't see the changes otherwise. I blogged much more about this topic - and yes I'm biased though I tried to be as little as possible. But after some time it wasn't simply possible: :-) And no not even IDEA is perfect I know it. Because I use it a lot. But it is the best Java IDE if you ask me. Even the Community edition. [This is not really an answer just an anecdote. I worked with guys who used emacs heavily loaded with macros and color coded. Crazy! Why do that when there are so many good IDEs out there?] if you know you way around emacs you can code 100x faster then an IDE. And it can handle bunch of diffrent languages so you do not need to change your coding enviroment if you need to code in another language. Works on all operating systems you can custimize/add anything you want. Even edit files half way across the world over ssh.(no downloading or uploading).Before calling them crazy you gotto use it first. i am sure they are calling you crazy for using an IDE :). It is often said that there are better IDE's for various languages (eg Java) than Eclipse. The power of Eclipse is that it's basically the same IDE for > languages meaning that if you know you'll have to code in several programming languages (Java C++ Python) it's a huge advantage that you only have to learn one IDE: Eclipse. I don't know if Eclipse is THE BEST Java IDE but it is definitely very decent and my favorite IDE. I tried IntelliJ briefly before and found that it's pretty similar to Eclipse (IntelliJ might offer some nicer features but Eclipse is free and open source).I never really tried NetBean because I know Eclipse before I know NetBean. Eclipse is my favorite because: If you are used to using conventional Java IDE like JCreator you might need some time to get used to Eclipse. I remember when I first learned Eclipse I didn't know how to compile Java source...   I would suggest that in order to find the best IDE FOR YOU try what people recommended (NetBean Eclipse and IntelliJ) and see which one you like the most then stick with it and become an expert of it. Having the right IDE will boost up your productivity a lot in my opinion.  Eclipse!  It can be slow at times and uses a lot of memory but it works well. I am going to have to recommend  by my job. I find the UI design much better than Eclipse. Also it comes with an incredible amount of features built in including great support for EJB3 JSF WebServices etc. It is essentially an IDE for the entire JavaEE stack (and the Oracle ADF framework as well). - All of the tools you will (probably) need for JavaEE development come with this IDE right out of the box no plugins required (unless you download the minimalist version). Talking about java Ide it is better to go for NetBeans.In My opinion it is better and provide great advantage over other ide but it has disadvantage over Eclipse that it grabs more more while working but do to its features and support i suggest Netbeans than any ide This is subjective... I find it to be a good tool. It depends what kind of development you're doing - for EJB stuff many folk would favour Netbeans. It also depends how much you want to spend - I assume you're talking about free IDEs? In my opinion if you got the resources to use then go with eclipse. NetBeans which is awesome like eclipse is another best option these are the only 2 I've ever used (loved needed wanted) Eclipse is hands down the most popular and for good reason! Hope this helps. Agreeing with the others. Netbeans is a pretty good IDE which also caters for other languages (PHP Ruby C/C++) if you're prone to using any of those. Then you get the added benefit of knowing your way around the IDE when deciding to pick up a new language. To be fair however I haven't had much time with the eclipse IDE. I'd agree with some of the others out there saying that NetBeans and IntelliJ are both good IDEs.  And I'd say that in using all three (Eclipse + other two) that Eclipse is by far my favorite.  I found some of the documentation out-dated but also found the support community very helpful.  I started using Eclipse by jumping into the deep end of the pool:  writing an RCP before ever learning the IDE.  The IDE was intuitive to use and when I found the right news groups to post to - most of my questions were already answered.  The hardest thing for me (and frustrating admittedly) was knowing how to phrase my search terms in order to get to the answer that was already posted. Remember that Eclipse is still ""relatively new"" as an IDE player though given that - it's pretty darn robust. My only complaint about Eclipse is that with each new release it seems to hog up more resources.  With a mid-sized project/workspace it takes seemingly forever to build (or rebuild) the project.  Compared to IntelliJ it's faster and more intuitive to use. Don't forget that Eclipse Platform was started by IBM. There are few platforms out there. The advantage with Eclipse is that it can be customized to your development pleasure plugins can be written for Eclipse to conform to your needs (e.g. The Eclipse ""Easy Explorer"" plugin for browsing the directory of your source in Windows Explorer).Eclipse allows you to also incorporate other languages/SDK's such as C++ Silverlight projects Android Projects for development. You can also easily manage resources in Eclipse. In my experience NetBeans are resource intensive. Oracle JDeveloper and IntelliJ aren't free though.Oh yes If you have issues or bugs with Eclipse Eclipse has the ability to restart and submit the crash to Eclipse servers. This is not really an answer just an anecdote.  I worked with guys who used emacs heavily loaded with macros and color coded.  Crazy!  Why do that when there are so many good IDEs out there? I have experience with using . I like it because it is easy to use and it is free. Give it a try if it interests you."
110,javascript - Efficient usage of WebStorm IDE ,I've recently fallen in love in WebStorm as an IDE for JavaScript development. The problem is I come from a world of vim and lightweight editors so I probably can't fully appreciate all the power that comes with IDE. Yes I've seen the presentations and read the docs but there's a lot of features and I'm not sure which of them are truly useful. So here goes my question: how do you use WebStorm and what do you find most useful? Any power-usage tips? Configuration hacks? Plugins worth mentioning? I'm not looking for a list of features I'm looking for a real-world usage examples and impressions. PS. I work mostly with pure JS + Canvas element and some NodeJS.Some random thoughts maybe more later.... In the help definitely read the Basic Concepts and skim the WebStorm Usage Guidelines for actions that you care about. Learn to use  Ctrl-Shift-A. It allows you to 1uickly find actions you can do by typing part of them. With that you can find anything once you know it exists. WebStorm's (like IntelliJ) best magic is its code completion and refactoring features which come from its code parsing and awareness. It figures a lot of stuff out but you can help it out by making you have good source files. Put the commented versions of the libraries you use in your project so it can use those comments to display in the doc popups (just having them in the directory is all you need). Be sure to leave the tips on. Their forums are useful but if you have a problem or feature request put it right into youtrack.com. They are much more responsive there. You can also vote for the stuff you want added. And if you haven't seen it yet there is a VIM plugin which will give you VIM editor keys called  JsTestDriver integration. Plugins. You can always find something useful.
112,c++ - Run .exe outside IDE but use break points inside IDE ,"Using VS .NET 2003. Would like to run the .exe from outside the IDE (i.e. command prompt or double clicking .exe icon in windows) However still want break points to hit in the IDE. How do I set this up?(Running from outside IDE but IDE seeing it as run from ""Debug"" -&gt; ""Start"") Thanks.On the Debug menu choose the ""Attach to process"" option to attach a debugger to your externally-running application. Visual Studio enables Just In Time Debugging by default.  If you haven't turned it off you can call DebugBreak() and you will get a popup allowing you to attach a debugger.  If you don't attach a debugger then the program will exit so you could try wrapping the DebugBreak call in a MessageBox or some other conditional code based on an environment variable or config item. Since it is C the call to DebugBreak() is correct - this will give you a nasty error dialog (different look depending on the OS) which should have a 'Debug' option. If you click this you should get a dialog to select one of the installed debuggers (VS.NET shoud be among them). Selecting it should bring you to the DebugBreak() line. However this can fail if the debugger can not find the pdb files for your app - in that case you will just get the disassembly view and no source code view. You can also use WinDBG and the 'Open executable option' - again it will need the pdb files to yield anything useful.  "
120,Python IDE for teaching? ,I am a student in a year 11 Computer Science class. Previously having taught only Visual Basic my teacher is looking for a language and IDE to teach the class with that is cross-platform and is easy to learn so I suggested Python to him for the language. However he would also like to teach with an IDE with it that includes a form builder in addition to the typical functions of an IDE (editor project management code completion debugging etc.). Having only ever developed with a text editor (usually ) and a relevant compiler I know next to nothing about IDEs and what would be good to use. I've also realised that Python has bindings for a multitude of graphical toolkits of which one is probably chosen for use 'behind-the-scenes' in each IDE's form builder so that is certainly another thing to consider. Could anyone suggest a free open source IDE for Python that would fit my class' needs and would be able to run on Windows Mac OS X and Linux-based operating systems at least? For those who recommend that plain console programming is the best start for beginners I agree! If I were the teacher I'd direct my students straight over to the Python console that is already installed on the computers and start teaching some programming not tainted by the issues of GUI programming. However I would still like to find an IDE for him in case he says that he has to follow the curriculum strictly and needs to teach GUI programming with an IDE/form builder.PyDev is a Python IDE for Eclipse  which may be used in Python Jython  and IronPython development.emacskate - linuxeclipse  
121,Install SuiteCloud IDE into Eclipse ,"I am trying to Install . I followed as per instructions like.  But when I go on help -&gt; Install New Software In second step I am getting below error. Kindly help me how to resolve this error. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.I have had this issue in this past. Rather than fixing the Eclipse errors I opted to installing another version of Eclipse and installing SuiteCloud IDE after doing this worked fine. First navigate to:  Scroll down the list and locate ""Eclipse IDE for JavaScript and Web Developers"" Install to your root directory (C://) Then try installing SuiteCloud IDE again. Hope this helps.  plug-in is required. Version 3.9.2 of this plugin was first included in Eclipse Kepler (4.3) so you need to be running at least this version of Eclipse. Older versions won't work."
125,Visual studio Java IDE ,Can visual studio 2013 be used as a Java IDE? Or what Java IDE is similar to visual studio in terms of ease of development? I have already tried Intellij and Eclipse but they lack as compared with visual studio.I don't think you will find anything better than IntelliJ which is by far the best Java IDE out there IMHO.
127,java - NetBeans IDE 8.0.2 Support for Netbeans IDE 7 ,I am starting a computer science class and need to download Netbeans IDE on my Mac 10.6.8. The latest Netbeans edition compatible with my Mac is NetBeans 7. However in my class we use NetBeans IDE 8.0.2 Am I able to transfer projects between both versions (via thumb drive) and edit them on both versions of Netbeans? Thanks for the Help!You can try it but I have had trouble in the past with some custom Ant extensions Netbeans uses breaking when you try to use an older version of Netbeans than the one the project was created with. The other way seems to be less problematic.  I have almost always been able to open projects created with an older version of Netbeans with a newer one. I think there are two options: copy the source folder(netbeansprojects[Your project]\src) and copy it to a thumb drive. Open a new project in your pc (the one in your class 8.0.2) and go to THAT projects src delete it and replace it with the one from you're flash drive.
128,eclipse - Run Vertx in an IDE ,"Is there any way to run Vertx from within an IDE? I know I can create a server in a file and then call  from the command line but is there a way to run the server.java file from within an IDE?create a maven project as the  says. Then import the project as Maven project Create a new launcher (Eclipse) using as main class   In the tab ""Program Arguments"" type: "" if your verticle is written in another language use the prefix with the name of the language as follows: And so forth. The accepted answer is perfectly fine.Just for completness's sake you also simply can run a plain old java main class having a the main start your vertx instance. Code should be something like: There you go. I previously edited an earlier answer but I'm separating it out for the sakes of clarity. The example below is for eclipse but the same basic premise should work with any IDE. Set up your ) such as and add the IDE specifics via maven for example for Eclipse By that you have an ready to import and ready to use project in Eclipse. To actually start it then I wouldn't go directly for a Main or Starter Verticle as but just simple run it through Maven in Eclipse as new Run Configuration. Create a new Maven Run Configuration and set as goals It will start the > vertx-maven-plugin. I hope this helps. Best My setting below is done at IntelliJ 15.0.1 with vert.x 3.2.0 for Java add New Verticle like : 'Run' -&gt; 'Edit Configurations...' -&gt; replace 'Main class:' to'>' at'Program arguments:' -&gt; 'OK' Run and Debug!  If you are looking for options apart from creating a maven project (suggested in the other answers) you could do the following:"
135,xml - IDE for XSLT stylesheets ,What is the best IDE for creating and debugging complex XSLT stylesheets?  For debugging the ability to set breakpoints and step through the source would be great. I am interested in all options both commercial and free.Editors worth checking out: All have their specific advantages so just check them out. If you already have Visual Studio I'd suggest you just getting started with this one. I use Visual Studio. It lets you set breakpoints (conditional or otherwise) and establish watches on whatever XPath expression you can come up with. It also supports XSLT right out the box and colours it differently than regular XML so developing in it is very easy. My recommendation is XMLSpy but isn't free - . Hope this helps.

138,python - JavaScript IDE? ,This is a super basic question I am just unfamiliar with the definitions to some of the terminology. I am using a mac and i'm looking for a IDE(I assume it is an IDE as that is what I use for python) so I can write in JavaScript for study offline and see my results. I have searched google downloaded Aptana Studio 3 and a few other suggestions also I have the latest version of Xcode. Maybe I am just overthinking this or it is my lack of experience but I can not seem to figure  out how to write JavaScript or other specific languages inside one IDE. Sorry if this seems like too straight forward to answer but i'd really like to find an IDE for OSX that is free writes at least html5 css and JavaScript. Yes I have googled that and how to begin writing JavaScript on a mac. Thanks a bunch!an IDE stands for Integrated Development Enviroment so a program that helps you write programs is an IDE an IDE for javascript could be any text editor write your code as regular text save it with .js as extension and add a reference to that file from an html page. I think you can use these free IDE's on mac: Sublime Text and Aptana Studio  I'm sure there's alot more just google it

You can stop the script now open the script in the debugger or let the script continue.Script:  Windows 7Firefox 38.0.5Selenium IDE: 2.8.0I am using couple of add-ons related to Selenium (e.g.: Sel Block).
164,IDE For html5 development ,I need IDE for Windows that can show result in real-timelike Espresso on Mac OS X does. Any suggestion?It does not do it real time but I suggest using Aptana Studio for HTML5 developing. You just need to save and then refresh your browser.
179,"ide - How do I ""Add Existing Item"" an entire directory structure in Visual Studio? ","I have a free standing set of files not affiliated with any C# project at all that reside in a complicated nested directory structure. I want to add them in that format to a different directory in an ASP.NET web application I am working on; while retaining the same structure. So I copied the folder into the target location of my project and I tried to “add existing  item” only to lose the previous folder hierarchy. Usually I have re-created the directories by hand copied across on a one-to-one basis and then added existing items. There are simply too many directories/items in this case. So how do you add existing directories and files in Visual Studio 2008?Drag the files / folders from Windows Explorer into the Solution Explorer. It will add them all. Note this doesn't work if Visual Studio is in Administrator Mode because Windows Explorer is a User Mode process. Enable > This is what I do: Then everything will be added on your solution from folders to files and files inside those folders. A neat trick I discovered is that if you go to ""Add existing..."" you can drag the folder from the open dialog to your solution. I have my Visual Studio to open in Admin Mode automatically so this was a good workaround for me as I didn't want to have to undo that just to get this to work. There is now an open-source extension in the Marketplace that seems to do what the OP was asking for:  If it doesn't do exactly what you want the code is available so you can modify it to suit your scenario. HTH What worked for me was to drag the folder into Visual Studio then right click the folder and select ""Open Folder in File Explorer"". Then select all and drag them into the folder in Visual Studio. In Windows 7 you could do the following: Right click on your project and select ""Add-&gt;Existing Item"". In the dialog which appears browse to the root of the directory you want to add. In the upper right corner you have a search box. Type  whatever the type of files you want to add. After the search finishes select all files click Add and wait for a while... The cleanest way that I've found to do this is to create a new Class Library project in the target folder and redirect all of its build output elsewhere.  It still leaves a .csproj file sitting in that folder but it does let you see it in Visual Studio and pick which files to include in your project. It's annoying that Visual Studio doesn't support this natively but CMake could generate the Visual Studio project as a work around. Other than that just use Qt Creator. It can then export a Visual Studio project."
197,IDE for elasticsearch ,I was searching extensively for having an IDE for elasticsearch. But I am unable to find one. I know it is simple Restclient will do but in most of the rest client the body editor doesnt have automatic indention and all. I was thinking If there is no IDE I can make one so that other people can also benefit from it. To make it I need how to create an editor? Any tools are available which will do proper json formatting while typing. IF that is there I can start a github project and start making an IDE. I can also add keywords of elastic search and it will easy for developers. IF that kind of thing is already there please point me to it. I am unable to find out one.The best option I have disovered so far is the Atom plugin . Elastic does not endorse promote or provide support for this application but works.

How is it possible for the IDE to deduce the type of this object beforehand so I get autocompletion inside the method?  I am using pycharm. If anyone knows any other IDE which is capable to do so I am open to suggestions.Since Python 3.5 you can use  You can add type hint to the function signature   This is applicable to all data types. If some other value is passed as an argument then it will raise a 
215,IDE for php prado ,iam looking for IDE with intellisense support for PHP Prado. please suggest me some ide's. ------- iam looking for IDE with intellisense support for PHP Prado. Well I'm a Netbeans user and use multiple frameworks. If you use a framework and make sure that it's in your include-path Netbeans will automatically index the framework and provide intellisense for it. I don't think you need an IDE with framework specific intellisense I think you need an IDE that can do intellisense on existing frameworks :) How about Netbeans alfa version of Prado support : 
217,jquery php html ide recomendation ,  I'm developing with jquery/javascript css html and php and I would like to know if there is any IDE (even if plug-ins are required) that can give me context help (ctrl+space similar) in every language pointed out.I've been using Dreamwever but the completion help isn't as good as I'd like. If anyone could recomend a nice IDE I would be very appreciated.I always use NetBeans for my web development. It even has the option of automatically uploading everything you change (via FTP) every time you save it which is a great time saver. It has support for ctrl+space auto-complete and suggestions. PhpStorm is really good and it has zen coding support built in.  Aptana is always a good bet. Check it out.  NetBeans is awesome! It's absolutely free.
222,Difference between a IDE and text editor? ,"What's the true difference between an IDE and text editor with a bunch of plugins? Why should I prefer an IDE over a text editor for development?IDE stands for ""Integrated development environment"" not just a tool where you write the code but you can also compile it and debug it.. text editors in their nature usually don't do that they tend to go for a broader approach..be able to edit all types of files instead of specializing in a particular type or language.. sure you can have plugins specific for a type of file or language that compiles/runs/debugs but since is it done by plugins I guess the ""integrated"" part is of of the table so doesn't make much sense to cal it IDE and as said before because the nature of the text editors the potential for integrated development experience will always be limited In the end you want something that's going to make you the most productive. Whether that's Notepad or Vim or Sublime or something else is up to the user and the tasks required at the time. With that said an IDE does bring some solid benefits for development. Depending on the language and IDE this may include integrated build tools source control management unit testing tools automatic boilerplate generation and class/variable refactoring.  ""IDE"" isn't a very well defined term but in my experience single unit IDEs (as opposed to editor + added plugins) seem to have more powerful debuggers more integration between different tools in the IDE (e.g. easy to debug unit tests use of deep code analysis to feed autocompletion etc).  And of course more things work out of the box w/o having to download and configure plugins yourself and the GUI is often are easier to figure out for new users or novices.  But it's a personal choice and the bottom line is you should try the tools you're considering and choose the one that fits best with your needs. IDE is stands for ""Integrated Developement Environment"" where the programmer can develop efficient projects and it provides drag and drop facility which reduces the stress of a programmer. Editor is one which is related to a specific language where you an write the program and run the program.."
230,Delphi XE6 - IDE File Open button shuts down the IDE ,"Odd behaviour for an IDE choose File Open from the main file menu or press the file Open button on the toolbar and the IDE shuts down. Select ""Exit"" on the File menu to shut down the IDE and it produces the File Open Dialog. It seems unlikely that this is intentional behaviour or have the programmers gone mad? Update: It looks like when XE6 is first opened the buttons behave properly then reverse when a new vcl application is created. The machine is Dell latitude Win7 32 bit laptop. I have installed XE6 on my Win7 64 bit desktop machine and it appears to function correctly.This can be caused by extra files being added to the IDE's Bin folder. In my case it was the FastMM dlls.  I found the answer on the Embarcardero Forums: Per Remy's answer The IDE's copy protection is being invoked at startup. If unauthorized  non-Embarcadero files are placed in the IDE's \bin folder the  actions of the file menu's  Open and Exit items are swapped. You need  to find the offending files in the \bin folder and remove them. The poster there has the issue in XE5 I experienced the issue in Delphi 10.1 Berlin. With probability close to 1 this is due to one of the design time packages that you have installed in your IDE. Remove these packages one by one until the IDE returns to its normal behaviour. At that point you will have identified the faulty package and can dig deeper to understand why it breaks your IDE.   It seems that people other than you are facing the same issue. It is possible that they have installed the same third party components as you that are defective. And of course it is possible that this is in fact a Delphi IDE defect. "
233,C++ IDE on Linux ,We trying to choose an IDE for C++ development on Linux.The proposed options are KDevelop and Eclipse. Eclipse is highly customizable but Java centric and heavy.KDevelop is bounded to particular KDE (I believe because KDE API) and can not be replaced if required. What you use and why? ThanksDimaKDevelop because: Since you are comparing KDevelop with Eclipse let me also point out that: Also when I've used KDevelop I've been using it on Ubuntu which uses the Gnome desktop. On Gnome KDevelop still beats Eclipse in terms of startup time and is definitely worth using. Also one last note if you use CMake with KDevelop then you can distribute your source code to users on Windows Mac and Linux and they will be able to compile your source code even if they don't have KDevelop; CMake can generate a native Makefile a Visual Studio project an Xcode project or a KDevelop project. So the concern that you can't replace KDevelop really doesn't apply if you use the CMake backend. I use  works well as an IDE on linux given that it can be set up with integrated build and debugging. Code Blocks is an option I think the correct answer is to try both (and maybe others) for yourself. Personally I've used Eclipse for the past ~3 years. I'm satisfied with it but there are parts that I think could be better.  But I think your best bet is to install both and try them each for a week or 2 (maybe longer). A lot of this comes to do personal preference and taste. This is the 2009 version of the vi or emacs question :) I use CDT on eclipse I find it very responsive. Plus plugins like Subclipse Mylyn etc really make development a lot easier. I use Java and C++ together is some projects so the fact I can code Java/JNI/CPP in the one IDE makes life a lot easier in my opinion. If you are looking for light IDE you can try vim. With appropriate plug-ins and skills it might be very powerful. QtCreatorEclipseNetbeansKDevelop Each has strengths and weaknesses and it'll depend a lot on on what else you're doing. You can also try  \M/
255,c++ - IDE that runs ON ios ,Has anyone found and IDE for programming ON iOS? Specifically I'm coding for the nds in c++ but I was wondering if there really is any IDE that is for coding on iOS. If anyone's heard of one please tell me the name because I have not been able to find one.Not specifically an IDE for C++ but there are alternatives: The closet thing I know is  
262,c++ - C++0x IDE support with g++ ,What IDE has a better support for the new C++0x features in g++? I know you can use the editor as is and compile the code using -std=c++0x but I would want the new features do not be marked as errors by the IDE (auto range-based loop variadic templates etc.).Here is  has had support for a while but I do not know to what extent.
265,Glassfish IDE integration ,I am an Eclipse user.I am going to be using Glassfish on a project.Is the Glassfish IDE integration substantially better in NetBeans (or some other) or is the integration the same as Eclipse?with the full set of JavaEE plugins in Eclipse it's trivial to control/deploy to glassfish. Grab the JavaEE version of Eclipse and follow the wizard for creating a new enterprise application. Generally speaking unless you're debugging the only intergration you really need is: start stop deploy. You can make almost any IDE/script/buildfile do that. Stick with the IDE you're most productive in. I can't compare it to eclipse because I never tried it in eclipse but I can cast my vote for Netbeans integration. I've been using it for a while with Netbeans and I am very satisfied with the result. I stuck with Eclipse. Glassfish IDE integration is better with NetBeans.   The plugin for Eclipse isn't quite ready for primetime. My personal experience is that Eclipse with the Java EE extensions are more than sufficient for development and deployment of JAX-WS apps are faster in Eclipse than with Netbeans. The Glassfish plugin has forms for editing configuration for things as nuanced as WSIT WS-Security and WS-AtomicTransaction.  This speeds configuration.  However I've found that deploying a JAX-WS app performs ws-import more times than necessary which doubles deployment time.
271,java - How to detect that code is running inside eclipse IDE ,"How to  detect that code is running inside eclipse IDEI am not aware of a generic way to get this kind of information. One suggestion: When you start a Java program (or a web server) inside Tomcat simply add an argument that will indicate that this program is launched by Eclipse. You can do that by opening the ""Open Run Dialog"" (""Run"" menu) then select your type of application and add in the ""Arguments"" tab a  dir whereas most of your end users will be running the app from a JAR. You may try something like this:"
276,java - Compiling Code - Creating an IDE ,I've been deving an IDE for Java Assembly and JMM for the last two months and have been able to have the JMM compiler to run through the IDE and compile the given code. For some reasonI cannot seem to find a way to do this with Java code. Is there any API call I can use to compile a given class or even somehow invoke javac and give it the necessary values through the command line?  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  You can use the 
279,Vim plugin for Netbeans IDE ,I have found a couple of Vim plugin for Eclipse but some computers have performance issues with Eclipse. So what I want to know if there is any plugin for the Netbeans IDE which runs smoother on weaker computers.  If it matters I'm interested in support for Java Python and C++. (any answer regarding to one of them in welcomed) .Found these apparently they even have some features my eclipse plugin doesn't:  I got jVi for my NetBeans 8.1 and 8.0.2 on Mac OS this way: Tools -&gt; Plugins -&gt; Available Plugins -&gt; Search:  the results will be empty. The truth > easy to find and install a vi[m] emulator for NetBeans. You don't even have to type the whole three letters.

294,eclipse - IDE for Java Swing ,"I'm trying to learn how to build a basic GUI using Java Swing. Right now I know literally nothing about it but I'm going through . The first thing I noticed right off the bat was the title: ""Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE."" Up till now I thought an IDE was basically just something that you could write and run code within (I've been using Eclipse) Why does this tutorial specifically encourage the use of NetBeans? Edit: And can I just keep using Eclipse?Maybe because Oracle owns/creates NetBeans. "
295,java - Eclipse IDE Scope Highlighting? ,"When I first learned Java I was using an IDE called ""BlueJ."" It had this feature called ""Scope Highlighting"" which made it very easy to read blocks of code. Now I've moved on from BlueJ and began using Eclipse. I'm currently in the process of customizing Eclipse to my liking and would like this Scope Highlighting feature inside Eclipse. I've searched everywhere for an answer on how to do it but I cannot find any information pointing to a solution for doing it in Eclipse. Here's a picture to demonstrate what Scope Highlighting looks like: I'm afriad that closest you can get is  It is selecting wider block of code. pressing this few times will give you very similar result to what you are searching for. I use it often.. it is useful also for refactoring.EDIT: As @j2emanue said:  I think the best option for you is EditBox a scope highlighting plugin for Eclipse: This isn't exactly what you're after but you can put your cursor in a method and then click the Show Source Of Selected Element only button on the toolbar. Your editor gets reduced to just that method. Click again and your back to your entire file."
302,PhpStorm IDE-wide deployment settings ,I am trying to configure my IDE to save the deployment settings for my servers IDE-wide rather than project specific. I know you could do this but can't find that setting any more. My PhpStorm is fully up-to-date so I'm not sure if I'm missing it somewhere or if that feature was removed. Any help appreciated.

Are there any good concise and up-to-date tutorials apart from the official ones that could bring me up to speed on how to use the IDE efficiently (shortcuts debugging views ...)? This excludes programming tutorials as I don't really need them unless there's a special manipulation involved.Please take a look at this  From within NetBeans go to  to see all the main shortcuts.In the same menu you have a link to the Help which contains good explanation for how to use the debugger. There's also the online help link with links to many tutorials including video ones. Also most of the content of 
320,Android Studio vs. Eclipse IDE? ,"Google just announced the latest release of the newest Android IDE called Android Studio.

Also it has """" but Eclipse has a plug-in for it right? Regards."
331,java - Is jEdit usable as an IDE? ,"After some frustration with other text editors I recently discovered .  It seems like a light-weight editor that has so many plugins that it could be grown to be a full IDE.  I especially like how it handles SQL.  I've found quite a few people that happily converted from Emacs to jEdit.  But have yet to find people that converted from an IDE. I'm not trying to argue which is the best IDE.  I just want to know if people are actively using jEdit as an IDE and how it compares to other IDE's they've used.  I have been trying to get jEdit to be an IDE but it appears to take quite a bit of configuration and I'm concerned it will just be a waste of time.Based on this I think you can:  I believe that the tool that was created to do specific task shall be preferred over tool which has wider range of use. (in general) So in case of jEdit - it is great but it is used more as good text editor. And full-scale IDEs (like NetBeans) are designed to do only one task - programming thus they are better at it.And I do not know of any project which uses jEdit as IDE. (Basically there are two big groups of projects - those that still use Notepad or gedit to do coding and those that use ""normal"" IDEs so jEdit lies in the middle and is never used) The key question is ""IDE for what?"" The big IDEs (Netbeans IntelliJ Eclipse) support certain mainstream languages very well but starting your own specific support for some smalland exotic language is relatively hard in these big and complex platforms.  jEdit is a very able text editor not and IDE but it can be easily brushed up to support a some IDE-like things with relatively little effort. Your programming can be done via jEdit macros Beanshell scripts Java or any other more modern language on the JVM such as Scala."
342,Ruby IDE (from a Visual Studio background) ,For a university I was advised to learn Ruby before starting. I have a strong .NET background (with C#) and would like to find an IDE for Ruby. I'm currently very familiar with/used to VS2010 and VS2012.I find  have plugins for Ruby between the two I personally prefer Netbeans but I only use them for Java programming. For Ruby I use Vim which you can customize into whatever needs you have. All the people I know use a text editor for Ruby (at my company either Vim or Sublime Text 2). Not that Ruby programmers can't use an IDE but they generally don't. If you're looking to learn Ruby might be worth trying it out without a full fledged IDE. If you already have Visual Studio 2010 installed (seems to always be installed as part of other Microsoft Tools) Ruby In Steel 2.0 is definitely worth a look. Sure it's using an older shell but it's fast and familiar.
349,Installing package without IDE on Lazarus from command line ,I am trying to automate installing of my package to IDE from the command line using () article.   When using IDE the package is installed correctly and my components appear on Lazarus palette.To verify the article steps after installation with IDE I copied  to a temp folder so I have my package registered there.   Then tried without success:1. uninstalled my package from IDE2. called 3. called  and built my package4. copied all the kept files (5. copied kept 6. created 7. finally called 8. alternatively tried . The palette also missed my components.If I select then  this makes my package installed correctly after IDE is rebuilt the second time. Version info:   Lazarus: 0.9.30.2     FPC: 2.4.4     OS: Win 7   Am I missing something? Is there alternative to register packages from the command line without IDE? Thanks in advance.Lazbuild in current Lazarus (at least as far back as 1.0RC1) has been extended to be able to install packages.For this you can use the --add-package and --build-ide together.See 
359,java - Eclipse IDE within docker ,"I do dev on a Windows machine and using docker via docker-machine. Due to help from @VonC was able to achieve   to install Eclipse into the container where Java resides.  So if my code resides in my host machine and whole java subsystem is within the docker container would Eclipse be able to build the code? Has anyone working on a non-Linux (preferably Windows) host got Eclipse IDE to build java applications using a java docker image to hold all things java. You can achieve this behavior by using eclipse che:  (authored by the same person as blog post) Even when it is possible someone should care about making new images for every Eclipse version. And I have just raised issue ""run on Windows"" #7 explains"
361,python - IDE: autocomplete at django ORM double underscore ,Is there an IDE which knows the django ORM and can can tell me the matching completions after the double underscore?

I haven't used Django in 2 years and Sublime Text has changed a lot as well in that time but give it a try.  and some info on
365,Using IDE together with docker ,I started looking into docker lately and I understand a lot of the benefits it offers I think you can quickly create a docker container and run it on different machines. Building (compiling) is also relatively easy you can download the maven image for example and just build your code. That works fine. So building is easy testing is easy and deploying (and running) in production is easy.  What I don't understand is how docker can make the development phase easier. And what I mean with the development phase is starting up your IDE reading code quickly navigate through your methods definition using the methods the IDE provides use intelliSense etc. Then change something run a unit test try a different third party library etc. All things you can do with your IDE. But I don't understand how to do this with a docker image. I've read a few posts about starting the IDE from within your docker container but that requires setting things up with a windows manager and I am not sure if that's the way to go. Of course I can set up my laptop in such a way that I can do all of this with my IDE but that way I bypass all of the benefits docker should offer. I still have to download dependencies set up environment variables do a lot of manual settings etc. And not just me but everyone in the team.  So not a very concrete question possibly a duplicate but I just can't wrap my head around it how to use an IDE together with docker?Yeah it's hard. It also depends on what language/framework you're using. But the things you mention are all easy to accomplish. For example we use Ruby a lot and someone in my team uses RubyMine to work with his code. That source code is mapped onto the container so the changes are reflected immediately. If you want to run a test I'm sure you can override the command your IDE brings by default with something custom like  or similar. At least that's what I do with VIM. Probably the most important missing part when doing dev with Docker is debugging. I think JetBrains is starting to add features to their IDE's but I'm not sure on the status of that.  Also almost every IDE or good editor has an integrated console. You could maintain a docker exec sessions opened there and run all your app commands like tests generators or any other. Even do some basic debugging. Hope it helps.

But I wish it would be great to have an IDE like the VC++ IDE for windows.There are Eclipse CDT () both great IDEs with pretty much same features as Visual Studio.If you are starting developing for Linux and Windows you might want to get a deep look into CMake ( (from my desktop). That's a slightly old version so I'm sure the interface offers more by now. CodeBlocks and Anjuta are pretty fair enough as pointed out by Brian Campbell

431,java - Work with docker and IDE ,"To share installation we decided to work with docker. For each project global dependencies are installed inside the container. We are developping with Python (and Java but at this time let's speak about Python only ;) ) Working with Vim (for example) I want to use code completion but because the entire libs are installed in container my vim installation on host cannot access them. This is true with Java Javascript and so on and it's absolutly normal... But is there any solution to be able to work with container getting access to libs for IDE without to install IDE in the container itself ?But is there any solution to be able to work with container getting  access to libs for IDE without to install IDE in the container itself  ? The trick is to run your IDE from the container. Your IDE is installed on your host you just run it in the container.  For this to work you need an  container that has: An example of all this with a well known Python IDE instead of vim is discussed here: Warning: this has been validated on Ubuntu 14.04 only.  Why don't you checkout the official image for python? It doesn't provide exactly what you're looking for but it supports a workflow where the container is built the same way as it should be run on your development machine (dependencies listed in the ""requirements.txt"" and downloaded using pip). Hope this helps. You may also try using cloud-based IDEs like eclipse che or cloud9. It has support for docker and runs in a browser. Update:I just found out that eclipse che and cloud9 are not mature enough to run java apps so you might want to try Intellij: "
448,e commerce - JetBrains IDE with Demandware ,I was wondering if anyone has used Demandware with any of JetBrains IDE. I've always just used text editors and the Terminal. It seems like Demandware UX Studio is only for Eclipse? Any help or suggestions is much appreciated.In theory you can use your editor of choice to edit Demandware ISML files and DW Script files such as Sublime or JetBrains but you would need some kind of WebDAV-Sync solution to automatically upload your files to the server.  You'll also lose debugging when you move away from Eclipse. Editing pipelines will also be quite challenging as you won't have the visual IDE to edit the files (which are basically just XML). Fortunately there has been some movement in the community and a plugin has been created for Jetbrains it is available here:

I was trying to think of a language that 'required' an IDE but could not come up with one.Many of the ""graphical languages"" more or less require an IDE. They aren't particularly popular at the moment but the general idea is a ""language"" where you create programs by drawing some sort of diagram. Depending on the intended market you frequently see something with a flavor or UML or ERD or even flowcharting depending on the intended market age of the tool and level of "
490,eclipse - Java source code management with different IDE ,Is it necessary to use the same ide to program in java? For example I use IntelliJ to build a small java project about 2000 lines. Then the marker uses Eclipse IDE to mark this project. Does he need to import all the source code into a new project and set up everything for it?  I didn't use any add-on on this IDE. The reason I asked this question because I receive huge grade duction for using different IDE the prof response me and said marker need rebuild everything for using different ide.  I drag my source code into Eclipse and it works very well so I am confused am I right or wrong?

If I make a mistake the  won't render my LESS CSS; that why I need IDE to correct some of my errors.. I haven't tried it so I'm not sure what ""first class support"" means. Intellij IDEA with plugin LESSand another plugin ""LESS CSS Compiler""you can compile CSS in real timewhen you edit LESS file the CSS is already output."
493,eclipse - Fast and interactive PHP IDE? ,"  Could you recommend me a PHP IDE? I've tried Notepad++ (a great text editor but.. just a text editor) and NetBeans. I've worked with Eclipse on Java too. I like NetBeans but like Eclipse it is so damn slow. Recently it started lagging every 3 seconds or so.. Most important features are: Auto-tab auto-completion of opened functions HTML tags syntax highlight auto-generation of comments for functions function and class hints (it should be able to ""look"" into my classes and their methods like NetBeans). So basicaly I am looking for a NetBeans-like lightweight text editor :) Any ideas?I haven't tried it myself but I've heard many people raving about  which I would describe as a lightweight IDE.  It's not as feature-laden as Netbeans/Eclipse but is quickly to its set with every update. vim on the other hand is as lightweight as it gets but by default probably doesn't have all the goodies you're looking for.  However if you're willing to spend the time configing and installing plugins you can make it whatever you want. I'd go for Netbeans but since you don't want it most programmers praised (and still praise)EMACS . Emacs is available for every platform. Some people consider it to be the best. Truth is that it is very fast auto-completion of your code and many other features. It takes a few days to get used to the powerful shortcuts but once you're done with it I guess you'll find it very smooth. You only need to install the application and activate the PHP plugin (or else if needed). Hope this helped. I have moved from Netbeans to PHPStorm and quite satisfied by features you can automate and so far it is much smarter on guessing what I'm typing.In my opinion Netbeans is more about Java programming and PHP feature behave as a little addon.Before Netbeans I was playing with PHPDesigner also nice and fast IDE for a reasonable price."
