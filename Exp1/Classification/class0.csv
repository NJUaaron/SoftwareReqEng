1,performance - Why is the Android emulator so slow? How can we speed up the Android emulator? ,I have got a  should start fairly quickly on such a machine but for me it does not. I have followed all the instructions in setting up the IDE SDKs JDKs and such and have had some success in starting the emulator quickly but that is very rare. How can I if possible fix this problem? Even if it starts and loads the home screen it is very sluggish. I have tried the  (Ganymede). Currently it supports only Intel® VT (Intel Virtualization Technology). The Android emulator is based on . The interface between QEMU and the HAXM driver on the host system is designed to be vendor-agnostic. Update Eclipse:Make sure your Eclipse installation and the ADT plug-in are fully up-to-date. Update your Android Tools:After each Eclipse plug-in update it is important to update your Android SDK Tools. To do this launch the Android SDK Manager and update all the Android SDK components. To take advantage of HAXM you must be on at least release version 17. C:\ProgramFiles\Android\android-sdk\extras\intel\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_ManagerFor those still interested:Try using  on May 15 2012.  This worked for me. The emulator is now fast and the UI is smooth. The first half of the instructions are detailed enough so I will assume you were able to install the Intel x86 Atom System Image(s) using the Android SDK manager as well as Intel HAXM. Now to ensure that everything else is set up so you can enjoy a highly performing emulator: And start it: If HAXM is working properly you may see this message when launching the emulator: HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virtual mode Otherwise you may see this error: HAX is not working and the emulator runs in emulation mode emulator:   Failed to open the hax module  (Gingerbread)).Developing on a Mac would be better. Why use an emulator BTW? Using a real phone makes more sense. As of Revision 17 of Android SDK Tools the emulator can use graphic acceleration and CPU-provided extensions for better efficiency. The prerequisites and full configuration and user notes are at:    After these changes Android Emulator was launching in 5-10 seconds and running without any noticeable lag.Be aware that these features are hardware dependent (CPU/GPU) and may not work on some systems. A new option is the  file you've deployed. Android emulator is dead slow. It takes 800MB memory while running.If you are on Windows You can use Microsoft Android Emulator. It is superb provides you functionalities more than Android Studio Emulator. And most important it is fast ( consumes 13MB only).It comes with Visual Studio 2015 Technical Preview. I am using it and happy with it. I downloaded and installed entire VS pack I need to look how we can install VS Emulator only.  EDIT:Try  version and then go to app open Settings/Preferences the go to Build Execution Deployment → Instant Run. Click on Enable Instant Run. And After That This will ensure you have the correct gradle plugin for your project to work with Instant Run. And Instant run will look like this  However Android Studio is right now in Preview you can try it now.

Remember to copy the string before you start searching!  Open  Search Dialog  is actually pretty important.When you have last clicked on file you're working on you'll get a different search window - ::yes but you need to open the global search panel.to do so press the binoculars icon on the top right corner of the IDE.  you can even filter searches by function identifiers method scopes an etc... First customize your search dialog.  Incremental search forward / backwards. Type search term after pressing  there is now search windowEclipse will restrict the search result using the Resource Filters defined for your project (eg. right click on you project name and select Properties -&gt; Resource -&gt; Resource Filters). So if you keep getting search hits from parts of your project that your not interested in you could make Eclipse skip those by adding a Resource Filter for them. This is especially useful if you have build files or logs or other temporary files that are part of your projects directory structure but you only want to search amongst the source code. You should also be aware of that files/directories matched for exclusion in the Resource Filters will not show up in the Package Explorer either so you might not always want this. What others have forgotten is   It updates as quickly as you can type and allows for quick navigation using only the keyboard.

So what is this > that everyone knows but me? Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors. See  file. Linting is a process by a linter program that analyzes source code in a particular programming language and flag potential problems like syntax errors deviations from a prescribed coding style or using constructs known to be unsafe.  For example a JavaScript linter would flag the first use of parseInt below as unsafe:"

If this is better than  which  might come eventually with JSE or never at all is a matter of debate.I personally prefer . As other packages graduatedfrom  in the past the javax.annotation wouldbe a step in the right direction. I was hoping that they all have basically the same trivial implementationbut a detailed analysis showed that this is not true. First for the similarities: The ). As described in  the impact of runtime annotationsis smaller than one might think but they have the benefitof enabling tools to do runtime checks in addition to thecompile time ones.  Another important difference is > in the code the annotations can be used.There are two different approaches. Some packages use JLS 9.6.4.1 style contexts. The following table gives an overview:  use the contexts defined in JLS 4.11 which is in my opinion the right way to do it. This leaves us with  in this round. To help you to compare further details yourself I list the code of every annotation below.To make comparison easier I removed comments imports and the  annotation.(they all had  except for the classes from the Android package).I reordered the lines and .In and it has a longish implementation. From my experience If you are willing to buy into the Checker Framework just usetheir . These and other helpful Android-specific annotations are available in the : The support library itself has also been annotated with these  annotations so as a user of the support library Android Studio will  already check your code and flag potential problems based on these  annotations. If anyone is just looking for the IntelliJ classes: you can get them from the maven repository with JSR305 and FindBugs are authored by the same person. Both are poorly maintained but are as standard as it gets and are supported by all major IDEs. The good news is that they work well as-is. Here is how to apply @Nonnull to all classes methods and fields by default.See  for details. Just pointing out that the Java Validation API ( framework.Similar to Find-bugs or  is supposed to ship in less than 6 months:-OSimilar to  annotations. For example: If you use the correct  then the annotations  Click the ""police officer"" in the lower right corner of the IntelliJ status bar. And click ""Configure inspections"" in the popup. Next ...   There is another way to do this in Java 8.I am doing 2 things to accomplish what I needed: Example: So my question is do we even need to annotate when using java 8?  Edit: I found out later that some consider a bad practice to use ). The latter is only compatible with Android so it can't be used in non-Android JVM/Java/Kotlin projects. However the JetBrains package works everywhere. So if you develop Java packages that should also work in Android and Kotlin (and be supported by Android Studio and IntelliJ) your best choice is probably the JetBrains package. Maven: Gradle: Doesn't sun have their own now? What's this: the artifact containing the  is applied to item with a primitive type). The annotation processor provides additional assurance during the software development process that the information conveyed by the application of these annotations is accurate including in cases of method inheritance. One of the nice things about IntelliJ is that you don't need to use their annotations. You can write your own or you can use those of whatever other tool you like. You're not even limited to a single type. If you're using two libraries that use different @NotNull annotations you can tell IntelliJ to use both of them. To do this go to ""Configure Inspections"" click on the ""Constant Conditions &amp; Exceptions"" inspection and hit the ""Configure inspections"" button. I use the Nullness Checker wherever I can so I set up IntelliJ to use those annotations but you can make it work with whatever other tool you want. (I have no opinion on the other tools because I've been using IntelliJ's inspections for years and I love them.)"

10,Eclipse IDE for Java - Full Dark Theme ,"Is there any way to completely turn Eclipse to a dark IDE?Here's a  (Which I have changed a little bit) my Eclipse looks like the picture below:Moonrise is the best dark theme I have ever seen for Eclipse!Just follow the steps on the website and Enjoy! : Dark theme works well with Eclipse 4.5 onward with Windows 10.  No more black text on black background  Update June 2014: As mentioned din "" mentions: A new dark window theme has been introduced. This popular community theme demonstrates the power of the underlying Eclipse 4 styling engine..  Plug-ins can contribute extensions to this theme to style their own specific views and editors to match the window theme.  Update April 2013: It seems the solution below don't work well with Eclipse Juno 4.2 and Windows 8 according to  mentions: .  That can be done with the Eclipse Colour Theme plugin () although you get a fine set of dark themes with the default plugin install and may not need to come back to their website for any more. Get the plugin here. .  This plugin gives you a GUI editor for the chrome colour scheme: .  If you want a dark one go ahead and click away until eclipse is dark. Once you are done some GUI surface area will show through the system theme as mentioned at the top of this post.  Rather than using that editor you could install the pre-baked Dark Juno theme instead.  The install is manual.  Start by downloading it from here: .  It has to be copied into your eclipse dropins folder. This lives next to the eclipse executable not in your workspace or someplace like that. In my case the command to do the copy was: You could be running eclipse from any directory though so which eclipse will tell you where it should go.  Restart eclipse and you should find a Dark Juno option under . It is a nice neutral grey with some gradients and is a very good option. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Update December 2012 (20 months later): The blog post ""  It proves that again the concise codes and advanced features could be achieved by contributing or extending with the external form(like library framework).  New language is not necessary just for this kind of purpose. Update July 2012 (15 months later): I have seen one! (Ie a fully dark theme for Eclipse) as reported by "":   If you export your plug-in place it in the “dropins” folder of your Eclipse installation and your styling is available. "" for an example based on gtkrc resource. Original answer: March 2011 Note that a full dark theme will be possible with e4.(see : ""Fresh up your Eclipse with super-awesome color themes!"" Here is a screenshot:You'll find it there:) Insert the custom css in css editor of Chrome Theme. I spend several hours with CSS Spy to find out all the relevant information to make eclipse as black and this file as small as possible. There is also an .epf File for the Chrome Theme plugin preferences you should import.You can get it from my dropbox:   In the end your eclipse will look like this:I've build a win 7 dark theme base on the popular windows 7 'concave 7' theme for eclipse dark juno theme.And I also create a dark theme inspired from the editor color theme 'Zenburn' created by Janni Nurmin Here are photos of this theme: All settings of this theme is available on github: (I use guari and retta and I think that looks real good :)  I hope that it will  help someone :) Darkest Dark is the best dark theme.It also comes with different toolbar icon shapes.

28,macos - What's a good IDE for Python on Mac OS X? ,I'm about to start a new job where the coding practices are heavily centered around TDD and refactoring and whose primary development language is Python.  I come from the Java world and have been a confident user of Eclipse for a good long time.  When not working in Java I use emacs. I'm looking for an IDE for Python that will give me a lot of the capabilities I've grown used to with Eclipse not only for refactoring but in terms of code completion project management SCM integration (currently CVS but likely to switch to git one of these days) et al. What IDE should I use?Have tried many different (Kate Eclipse Scite Vim Komodo): each one have some glitches either limited functions or slow and unresponsive. Final choice after many years: Emacs + ropemacs + flymake. Rope project file open dialog is extremely quick. Rope refactoring and code assist functions are super helpful. Flymake shows syntax mistakes. Emacs is the most configurable editor. I am very happy with this config.  Python related part of config is here: public.halogen-dg.com browser/alex-emacs-settings/configs/cfg_python.el My 2 pennies check out PyCharm It's lightweight and offers Code Completion. Costs money. EDIT:Apparently Chocolat was an interesting option in 2013 but since then many others came up and development stalled. Nowadays I recommend Visual Studio Code + Python Plugin.

If the answer is no is there a more mature ""no sql"" solution like MongoDB that does have an IDE? By far the best UI (for Windows) currently out there  is MongoVUE. Robo 3T (formerly Robomongo) give you a shell like interface but outputs your results in the gui.Its available for windows mac(dmg zip) and linux (deb rpm tar.gz) as a desktop application.

81,Difference between IDE and Framework ,What is a difference between an IDE and Framework with respect to Java?Basically : Quoting wikipedia an  : is a software application that  provides comprehensive facilities to  computer programmers for software  development. An IDE normally consists  of: While a  : is an abstraction in which common code  providing generic functionality can be  selectively overridden or specialized  by user code thus providing specific  functionality. Frameworks are a  special case of software libraries in  that they are reusable abstractions of  code wrapped in a well-defined  Application programming interface  (API) yet they contain some key  distinguishing features that separate  them from normal libraries. An IDE is an application used to write and compile code.  A framework is generally a software component that someone else wrote that you can use/integrate into your own project generally to avoid re-inventing the wheel. A framework is a tool that is closely attached to the language you are using and usually extends upon or adds the the language features. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) provides automation support for the language you use with regards to syntax highlighting of keywords errors building projects cleaning them intgegration with VCS etc. and usually provides default support for popular frameworks used for your language. Java makes use of frameworks like Hibernate Struts and Spring to extend the language and NetBeans or Intellij IDEA bring support for these tools to your Java project in a structured manor. As per all answers I can come to a conclusion that Visual Studio is an IDE and .NET is a framework.And also a framework(list of .dll) can be integrated into an IDE. Mean framework is a part of an IDE.

Includes inline database connections code completion syntax checking color coding split views etc.  Downside: It's a memory hog on the Mac.  Be prepared to allow half a gig of memory then you'll need to shut down and restart. A step above a Text Editor. Does not support database connections or split views. Color coding and syntax checking are there to an extent. The project control on Komodo is very unwieldy and strange compared to the other IDEs. The perfect solution.  Eclipsed based and uses the Aptana PHP plug in. Real time syntax checking word wrap drag and drop split views database connections and a slew of other excellent features.  Downside:  Not a supported product any more.  Aptana Studio 2.0+ uses PDT which is a watered down under-developed (at present) php plug in. Good for Javascript/HTML/CSS but only marginal for PHP. There is some color coding but no syntax checking or code completion native to the package. Database connections are supported and so are split views. I'm using NetBeans which is free and feature rich. I can deal with the memory issues for a while but it could be slow coming to the MAC. Cheers!Korky KathmanSenior PartnerEntropy Dynamics LLC Komodo is wonderful and it runs on OS X; they have a free version Komodo Edit.   from 2015: I've switched to PHPStorm from Jetbrains the same folks that built IntelliJ IDEA and Resharper.

Does anyone know if there is any IDE or IDE-like system to work with GPSS? My dream is about intellisense good run-time debugger etc. P.S. Sorry but i can't create a new tag 'gpss'. Thanks.FastForward to 2016: I have used Wolverine's GPSS\H professional and student version.  There are several variations of GPSS and there are many other non-GPSS alternatives.     AGPSS has a GPSS has IDE.  A Toolbox GPSS-version exists for MATLAB (subset of commands).   GPSS's (Wolverine version) strength lies in that is computationally very efficient (lean) because it precedes Win-Tel \ DOS.  The successor to GPSS\H is Wolverine's SLX and both are considered to be at the forefront of speed and capability.  The student versions are available for download and evaluation Ok It's time to answer and finally close the question. As I told to  there are some companies in Russia but I didn't see their result.  However I found the one solution - . But I do not know if the development is in progress or the project already died. You can figure it out by yourself.

124,Any good visual HTML5 Editor or IDE? ,"Well it looks like Dreamweaver CS5 will try to smoother the HTML5 thing for a few more years (weeks actually). Seems like the next rung down is right to Notepad! Anyone know a good HTML5 editor with a visual/preview/style leaning? Eclipse with some pluggin? (Seems like the market will be begging for it soon.) Thanks  ...By the way. I know about the 'no browser support'...'not finished yet'..etc. That's not an issue for us. We are doing Safari Only websites &amp; iPhone iAd's only production...So we know what works in our implementations.(We mostly on Windows by the way) supports the latest HTML5 specifications and is quite fast (compared to version 2). There is a standalone and an Eclipse pug-in version available.UPDATE: Final release available (same link) Use  it has necessary code assists.Download in the field ""Name"" enter ""Google Plugin"" Click ok.     Wooo Yeah Start Coding.! Topstyle 4 is the only one I've com e across with HTML5 (and CSS3) support. Its early stages but it works enough for the most part. Since HTML5 is still in the works and doesn't have consistant support across any browsers yet my guess is that it's going to be quite a while before you get a WYSIWYG HTML5 Editor. In the mean time get used to editting your markup by hand in a good text editor like  has nice support for HTML5. Previously I was a heavy user of Eclipse but spend more time with NetBeans to play with HTML5 and Servlet. for online solution try maqetta and aloha editor for offline solution (download-able) try blue griffon they are free :)oh yeah one more my favorite editor :) and game editor also: construct2 Coffee Cup Just released one.

130,How do I edit the Visual Studio templates for new C# class/interface? ,"I find myself removing the following import statements in nearly every C# file I create in Visual Studio: Of course its really easy to do this with Resharper but I really should not have to. There must be a few template (class interface) somewhere in the VS directory from which I can remove the offending lines. Where do I find these files? Is there a better way to control the default import list?Extract edit and recompress. Paths are for the class template but the interface templates are in the same folder. You may want to edit the VS template file in each to remove the fact that they don't automatically add references to the assemblies System System.Data and/or System.Xml. . For Visual Studio 2012 to remove these from the default class.cs file the item template could look like this (do not include/remove using statements): Default Class Template file:C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplates\CSharp\Code\1033\Class\Class.cs More info here:  New class templates might be located in different folders depending on the project type as well. While working in a Web Project in VS 2015 I found that when editing the file  that I was able to create a new class with the default format that I wanted. Old question - new answer:Sorry for the maybe offending question: Why would you care about it at all. Productivity Power Tools (visual studio extension i would recommend using it anyway) -&gt; enable the option / setting called: ""Remove and Sort Usings on save""  No extra click / keyboard shortcuts / manual template modification etc ... since you have to save your files anyways. Just want to add to the excellent answer from Sam Harwell. There might be more than one class template for instance  has its own template at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual  Studio\2019\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplates\AspNetCore\Code\1033\Class\Class.cs"

152,c++ - How to configure CLion IDE for Qt Framework? ,"How to configure CLion IDE for Qt Framework?Is this IDE compatible with Qt or are there other IDEs compatible with Qt? I just want to try to use something else than Qt Creator.I was as desperate as you until I read .It worked perfectly for me! To summarize there are 2 main steps: Firstly CLion uses CMake to compile your code. It is based on CMake configuration files (e.g ""CMakeLists.txt""). You have to add Qt based CMake commands (the lines with 'find_package' and 'target_link_libraries'): Secondly CLion has to use the  binary installed by Qt. For that go to:'Preferences' -&gt; 'Build Execution Deployment' -&gt; 'CMake' and in 'CMake options' append the CMake path that Qt uses which should be in the directory where Qt is installed. For instance on OSX: You can test that everything is working fine by doing a little test script in  and adding in the last line: You can do this with all the other Qt5 modules. This approach is one of the simplest way to be used for the newest >: CMakeLists.txt: Resource files (.qrc) should be added to add_executable list inorder for moc to be able to run its procedure on the resource and theinternal file like qmls texts ... be accessible. qml files should be included in a qrc file and load using > you used a beautifier like ""Uncrustify"" to auto beautify the code on saving a source file then: As Tom Lank mentions Qt projects can now be managed with and built under CMake which makes CLion happy. . One thing that isn't mentioned in the Qt CMake manual or above is that you'll also need the lines: All of these calls to  file as a project in CLion.Most likely you'll need to tell CMake where to find your Qt packages with a line like this before your 's: Finally if you're running on / building for windows Qt no longer comes pre-built with GCC/Mingw32 libraries. You need to build with visual studio. Luckily  and I've found it to work for Qt projects; just be sure to set the architecture (under Settings-&gt;Build Execution Development-&gt;CMake) to x86_amd64 in order to build in 64-bit mode and be compatible with Qt's pre-build libs. All of this is tested with CLion 2017.1 Qt 5.9 and the Visual Studio 2015 compiler. You can build QT applications in CLion. QT Provides CMake modules that take care of all details.  The following CMake script builds the example application '). You can easily develop Qt with VC Eclipse CLion etc. when you use CMake as a build tool. CMake will generate the project files for each IDE. I was using several IDEs this way. After this journey I am an even happier user of Qt Creator.  The only thing you need is to add QT install  to your PATH. Don't forget to restart PC afterwards because CLion for some reason isn't able to refresh the path only full pc restart helps. "
156,python - Nuclide vs Atom-IDE ,What is the practical difference between the Nuclide package for Atom and the Atom-IDE package? I'm only a novice Python programmer and all I can piece together is that Atom-IDE is built from Nuclide but they both seem to have similar features and language support.Atom IDE contains a subset of Nuclide’s functionality. Specifically it contains the set of features needed to support language servers (). It’s maintained by the Nuclide team. Source: I am a member of the Nuclide team.
159,Is there any Gradle eclipse IDE integration? ,i'm looking for an eclipse ide integration for gradle. I've installed the gradle editor from But this is far away from what i expect from an ide integration. It provides only some syntax highlighting. No auto completion error mark task list etc. Is there any real ide integration for eclipse?The SpringSource Tool Suite includes Gradle support. See  for downloading STS.

174,Universal Programming IDE ,I'm searching for a good IDE that supports multiply languages and compiling of them syntax highlighting uploading of microcontroller projects etc. The problem is; I currently have 8 different IDE:s each for a different language (Programmer's Notepad (PHP HTML) Qt Creator (C++ with Qt libraries) Eclipse C++ (C++) Eclipse Java (Java) Processing (Processing) Arduino IDE (Arduino) AVR Studio (AVR (C)) Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express (Visual C++)) and I am sure more will be added to the list. So what I'm searching for now is a Windows (or cross plattform) Programming IDE with support for as many languages as possible and not only with syntax highlighting (PN) I want ONE button to compile a program and ONE button to Run/Upload the program not multiply from a list. Can someone please help me? with according plugins can support almost all of the above except maybe for VC++
180,Development oriented PostgreSQL IDE ,Could someone recommend PostgreSQL IDE oriented on developers not on database architects or administrators. I.e. I look for an IDE that will increase my productivity in:1. Writing stored functions (code completion and syntax highlighting)2. Ctr+Click navigation between functions (or any other way)3. Finding All References (where certain function or table is used)4. Refactoring stored functions (renaming function or variable; extracting function etc.)5. Refactoring tables (if I change column name functions and views that uses that column should be also updated)6. Structuring my functions during the development into kind of folders (let them be finally flatten on the database)The project that I currently working on has hundreds of tables and more than thousand of functions. Currently I work with pgAdmin and my productivity is extremely low.All database development tools that I checked so far from () do NOT cover even 10% of what I expect from a modern IDE.I think the Toad plugin for Eclipse is going to be the closest thing you can find.  Unfortunately having a totally comprehensive IDE with these features is going to be a huge project in part because PostgreSQL can use stored procedures in so many different languages so syntax highlighting inside the stored procedure requires a vast amount of knowledge (in theory to be considered complete not only sql and plpgsql but also C C++ Java Python Perl TCL R Ruby Lisp various shells PHP Lolcode and Brainfuck -- there are probably more but those are the ones that come to my mind).  Consequently the only hope of doing this is to tie into another IDE. This being said I and most devs I know tend to use bash vim etc.   It is a fundamentally different paradigm but it is more flexible in many ways and the limitations you do run up against force you to design and test your SQL in sane ways.
191,Enthought TraitsUI based Python IDE ,Has anybody come across an Enthought TraitsUI (Envisage etc) based Python IDE? I wonder why there is none when Enthought Tool Suite makes it so easy to create extensible python GUI applications. One reason I can think  of why such an IDE makes a lot of sense is because it will be cross platform. Any reason why such an IDE does not make sense?Any reason why such an IDE does not  make sense? Most people who use Python don't use the Enthought tool suite so there's not enough interest to create a project (or demand for a company to sell a product). I know that's not what you want to hear so here's a few options: You can always use Eclipse or another open-source IDE as a backend and just build a new UI. [Full disclosure: I work at Enthought] I agree with you the stack Traits + TraitsUI/pyface + Envisage makes a lot of sense to build a crossplatform IDE and is fairly simple. If you are interested in learning the stack and building one yourself there are several open source examples that you could use to get started: We have also been working ourselves using that stack as the backbone. The next version of EPD currently in beta will ship with that IDE (free) in the coming couple months.
193,javascript - TypeScript Web-Based IDE ,Given the fact that TypeScript is Open Source is  also available as a tool that can be downloaded anywhere? I'm developing a web application in which the client can write a user-defined expression (with user-defined variables and predefined methods) which is evaluated compiled and used at runtime on the server using C# .Net. Using TypeScript and its wonderful web-based editor's features like syntax or error highlighting code completion method signature suggestion etc  saves me lots of trouble in the user interface. So is this editor also part of TypeScript? If not is there any other open source solutions with similar capabilities?Update 2017: The . >Visual Studio Code is now open source which means we have access to the source of the Monaco Editor. I think this should now give us the ability to use the Monaco Editor in a browser I'm  there is goormIDE which is also cloud IDEthis is open source or service version  provides a VM with Root so you can install whatever tools you need and in this case TypeScript via .

247,IDE for debugging scons ,"I have a project which uses scons and swig. Which IDE I can use for debugging the code? I want to set breakpoints and use ""step over"" ""continue"" .... while watching variable. (Eclipse plugin) worked well for me in the past. Actually the  command you run to perform your build is a Python script -- you can replace it by a similar script within your IDE and launch that for debugging. Having said that -- actually I found the > of that kind of ""internal DSL"" is implemented in Python (which is surely an educational experience but not helpful for solving problems with my build). Thus usually I solve my problems just with adding some print statements to look into this and that variable in the current construction environment while the build script is evaluated. The manpage of SCons has extensive documentation about the various variables you can access in that environment object and in the dependency nodes defined when you add targets. Any Python debugger should be fine.  Visual Studio (trials available): Tobuy the latest Visual Studio google ""Buy Visual Studio"" (as the linkchanges) you can also google for a specific version.

249,External IDE for InterSystems Caché ,I want to replace the Caché Studio because it needs to be ran on Windows. Browser based IDE would be most convenient solution for using OS indepedently and mobile.There isn't a browser-based IDE available for Caché programming.  In fact the only alternative to Caché Studio is George James Software's  a commercial Visual Studio extension which allows you to work with ObjectScript code on the file system.  It allows you to export the classes from Cache and work with them as normal files on the file system. However this is for Windows-based systems only so I am not sure if it meets your needs. The XML > the actual source code.  Unfortunately there is no other option besides Studio but Intersystems is certainly working on one.
250,.net - VS 2010 IDE 2GB limit ,"I am using VS 2010 on a win 7 64 bit system with 8 GB of memory. My application is 32 bit. While in the VS 2010 .Net IDE the app shows up in the Windows task manager as ""MyApp.vshost.exe *32"" while the VS IDE itself shows up as ""devenv.exe *32"".  I checked and it appears that the VS 2010 IDE file (devenv.exe) is complied with the /LargeAddressAware flag.  However when debugging large models the IDE fails with an Out of memory exception. In the Windows Task manager the ""MyApp.vshost.exe *32"" process indicates about 1400 MB of memory usage (while the ""devenv.exe *32"" process is well under 500 MB). Is it possible to set the ""MyApp.vshost.exe *32"" process to be /LargeAddressAware in order to avoid this out of memory situation? If so how can this be done in the IDE. While setting the final application binary to be /LargeAddressAware would work I still need to be able to debug the app in the IDE with these type of large models. I should also note that my app has a deep object hierarchy with many collections that together required a lot of memory. However my issue is not related to trying to create say 1 large array that requires greater then 2 GB of memory etc. I should note that I am able to run the same app in the VB6 IDE and not get an out of memory situation as long as the VB6 IDE is made /LargeAddressAware. In the case of VB6 the IDE and the app being debugged are part of the same process (and not split into 2 as is the case with VS 2010.) The VB6 process can be larger then 3 GB without running into out of memory issues. Ultimately my objective is to have my app run completely in 64 bit to access more memory. I am hoping that in such cases the IDE will allow the debugging process to exceed 2 GB without crashing (and certainly more then 1.4 GB as is the current case). However for now while 95% of my app is 64 bit I am calling a legacy COM 32 bit DLL and as such my entire app is forced to still run in 32 bit mode until I replace that DLL.the IDE fails with an Out of memory exception No your program fails with that exception not the IDE.  You'd have to run editbin.exe in a post build event to set the flag: That will > work on the vshost.exe version you'll have to turn off the hosting process.  Project + Properties Debug tab. Some options I can think of: Disable the VSHost process - Do you actually require the  to forcibly set the flag in the .vshost.exe (no idea if that would work though!)"

286,visual studio - IDE placement on dual monitors ,"What IDE placement (output errors threads watch etc..) do you use (coding/debugging) in Visual Studio on Dual Monitors?Well slightly off topic I sit in front of 5 monitors two for each machine Machine A Machine B Machine C I have them configured like so - Left: The IDE with as large an editor window as possible.Right: Everything else. I always keep the IDE in the left monitor and save the right monitor for the app when running in debug mode.  If you are setting breakpoints in message handlers for events that fire when a window is redrawn you can get into some irritating event loops when your IDE pops up and covers your app (likewise when you expose the app again). Outside of that it really depends on which windows I need at the moment (call stack output memory etc.). We have some developers at our studio that use widescreen monitors turned vertical for more screen real-estate for their code.  I think that you have to have driver support for this mode.  For example the nVidia control panel will support rotation of monitors to accomplish what I've described. You lose the horizontal in favor of the vertical but many programmers here really like that mode. Properties window takes up 2/3 width of top half of monitor 2. Output/Error List/Pending Changes in a tab strip ~100% of lower half of monitor 2. Everything else is on monitor 1. I keep my IDE in my main monitor and put the properties output etc. tool windows grouped together detached on my secondary monitor. If I need to use the IDE and the secondary monitor at the same time (usually I don't just because of the type of apps I've been working on currently) then I'll switch to having the tool windows re-docked and set to auto-hide (which also works pretty well when using remote desktop). It depends on the monitors I have my laptop on the left due to the limitations of my desk so I have got used to having my IDE on the decent monitor on the right.  I would say the IDE should be the monitor easier to see my right monitor is more centered than the left laptop monitor I use a Mac therefore my Windows Vista (and XP) is virtualized in a VMWare or Parallels virtual machine. Both programs contain bugs when using multiple monitors and Unity/Coherence mode (that is make the windows invisible and only see the running programs).  Only the latest VMWare 2.0 RC released a few days ago is capable of this. (not without some glitches).  I use a Macbook Pro and an external 22'' display. The ""Main"" display is the external (22 &gt; 15) ;) So the OS X menu bar dock etc. is there. The Macbook Pro internal display is the small secondary display in my case sitting left of the big screen.  When I use VStudio I have the main VS display in the main display maximized. And the Solution Explorer Properties Classes and a few other toolbars using the left smaller screen.  All I see is Code and some toolbars but mainly all code. When I debug the floating tools disappear and others appear where the code is (the code window becomes a little bit smaller to accomodate this). No more floating stuff as the application runs in the Macbook Pro smaller display while I keep seeing the code/values/etc in the visual studio big screen. It's a nice way to work. I'd recommend it anytime. There are people that think that multiple displays not always means better productivity; solutions like ""virtual desktops"" are nice but cannot replace the speed of your eye moving from screen 1 to screen 2 to quickly glance at a property. I've tried Spaces on the mac and it doesn't come close. At least for programming. I keep everything in the left monitor and my DB/Firefox in the right hand one.  Mainly because i switch dev between one monitor and two monitors depending where I am and I dont want to have to get used to two layout configurations for using VS.  On my left the main screen (20"") with the IDE and a smaller one (15"") with Chrome PDFs and apps at my right :)"

299,testing - Using Selenium IDE with random values ,"Is it possible to create Selenium tests using the Firefox plugin that use randomly generated values to help do regression tests? I would like to help my clients do acceptance testing by providing them with a suite of tests that use some smarts to create random (or at least pseudo-random) values for the database. One of the issues with my Selenium IDE tests at the moment is that they have predefined values - which makes some types of testing problematic.  First off the Selenium IDE is rather limited you should consider switching to Selenium RC which can be driven by Java or Perl or Ruby or some other languages. Using just Selenium IDE you can embed JavaScript expressions to derive command parameters.You should be able to type a random number into a text field for example:  You can define helper functions in a file called ""user-extensions.js"". See the . >You can mix literals and random numbers like this: Gmail makes possible that automatically everything that use aliases for example  Multiplying *11111 to give you more random values than 1 to 9 (in Thilo example) You can add user exentions.js to get the random values . Copy the below code and save it as .js extension (randomgenerator.js) and add it to the Selenium core extensions (SeleniumIDE--&gt;Options---&gt;general tab) Way to use  Above code generates 6 charactes string and it assign to the variable x Code in HTML format looks like below: Here's a one-line solution to generating a random string of letters in JS: Useful for pasting into Selenium IDE. A one-liner for randomly choosing from a small set of alternatives: I made a little improvment to the function generateRandomString.When FF crashes it's good to be able to use the same random number again. Basically it will ask you to enter a string yourself. If you don't enter anything it will generate it. function generateRandomString( length chars ) {var string=prompt(""Please today's random string""'');if   (string == '')    {for ( var i = 0 ; i &lt; length ; i++ )        string += chars[ Math.floor( Math.random() * chars.length ) ];    return string;}    else    {    return string;}}"

370,Good C++ Debugging/IDE Environment for Linux? ,I have a friend who is trying to make the switch to Linux but is hung up on the apparent lack of debugging/IDE environments for C++ especially as they relate to template programming. He has been using visual studio for years and is maybe a little spoiled by their awesome IDE. Does anyone have any good suggestions for an environment where he can under Linux develop and debug with all of the usual things (Breakpoints line highlighting for compilation errors step in/over/out/etc etc) that he's accustomed to? Thanks!Although many people think of it as a Java IDE he could try  is very nice too but you will need a very good computer. In my opinion the best choice iss gcc gdb and ViM or Gedit. My buddies from work use Eclipse + Scons they also use Valgrind(spelling?) for tracking memory leaks and such. Many of the IDE features you listed were debugger features.  The ddd (Data Display Debugger) debugger is quite a nice GUI wrapper for gdb allowing graphical representation of data structures a non-crappy source listing window (ie. unlike the l command of gdb where you don't get context) and also allows you to use any and all native gdb commands directly if desired. Have a look at CodeLite. It's available for Ubuntu and Fedora out of the box and even for Windows and Mac. So you can have the same IDE on different platforms. We tried Eclipse and NetBeans but left them due to their huge CPU and memory usage. We have a development server and all the developers connect to it via RDC. Thats why these IDEs miserably failed in our model. So we looked for some native IDE. Found CodeBlocks to be very good and super fast. We sort of settled on it but later found CodeLite and liked it better than CodeBlocks.

471,How do I make my PHP IDE understand Dependency Injection Containers? ,Current situation: I have dependencies in my project that I solve by using dependency injection. I want to take the next logic step by using a dependency injection container (DIC) to ease the management of my dependencies and to lazy-load classes. I looked at  ran some test and really appreciate how DIC’s work. I’d probably go for Pimple because of its simplicity and raw power. If I didn’t have this problem: Due to the abstraction that DIC’s offer the IDE I’m using (PHPStorm) no longer understands what’s going on in my code. It doesn’t understand that $container['mailer'] or $sc-&gt;mailer is holding a class object. I also tried Netbeans IDE: same problem. This is really a problem for me because my IDE becomes useless. I don’t want to program without code hints autocompletion and refactoring tools when dealing with classes. And I don’t want my IDE to find all kinds of false positives when validating code. So my question is: Has anyone dealt with this problem and found a solution?You can define class of the variable 'manually': In PhpStorm (and by  which can read that file and open the autocomplete with the service names and its type (class string and etc). I'm using those two components and I can say that are good options for auto completion for Silex/Pimple. Pimple just introduce container builder principe. If you understand it you don't need Pimple any more: This way Pimple does not hide type of object in mixed $c['some key']. You would have autocomplete suggestions when edit your container. Phpstorm is able to autoresolve method return type from your code. And you would have clear container.  You can ever override container: To be honest container written in 'programming' lanuage is wrong way to go. Container responsibility is to bring initialized graph of objects to caller. Having access to 'programming language' allows to violate that responsibility with easy. Some DSL for configuring dependency is better. Moreover most of original dependency information (argument typehints of constructors) is just ignored by Pimple and sfDepenencyContainer making your configuration bloated and fragile.

480,debugging - How to debug Delphi IDE? ,"What are the detailed steps on how to debug the Delphi IDE? I understand from other posts that one needs to create a project and in the project's debugger settings set the project's ""host application"" to Delphi (). Then when the project is run in the debugger (by pressing the Your project is most likely an EXE-type. EXE type projects don't need host applications so the setting is ignored no other IDE is started. At a minimum you should make your project a DLL-type: that will start the second IDE but it will not be very helpful. The technique you mentioned is usually used to debug your > code to set a breakpoint. I would first check if the hang occurs at run-time as well as at design-time.  Instantiate the component dynamically in your run-time code.  If the hang sstill occurs then you can step through the component's source code normally using a single debugger instance.  You do not need to debug into a running IDE instance unless the behavior only occurs within the IDE process. First find and open the component packages turn both the runtime and designtime package build options from Release to Debug if they aren't already and rebuild. Then save a project group containing both the package projects (one designtime and one runtime in some exceptional cases people only have one package which is designtime+runtime in one). Then follow the steps to set BDS.exe as the Host Application. I would be tempted to add some  messages to the component that you know is broken: Constructor:  Destructor:  Finalization section of the unit that TMyComponent is in: Looking at the output Events page in the delphi debugger you can figure out how far the code got and even if you don't get an exception breakpoint that you can use to locate the flaw fairly accurately you can use either OutputDebugString messages like the above or you can even just set  in delphi and turn off the breakpoint property ""Break on exception"" and instead set up a ""log message"".  These messages (breakpoint messages) have the benefit of not requiring any damage to your component in order to add some simple ""print-statement-debug"" like capabilities to your debugging toolkit. If the second instance of Delphi is not launching then you have the path to bds.exe incorrect."
