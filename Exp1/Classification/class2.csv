4,Rename package in Android Studio ,"How do you rename packages in the new IDE Android Studio based on IntelliJ IDEA? Is there an automatic refactoring included?  I want to make bulk refactoring but I don't know how. I worked two years with Eclipse and in Eclipse it's a one-click operation.For example if you want to change  attribute in your manifest. Clean and Rebuild.  (which is now independent of the package name) can be done very easily in one step. You don't have to touch AndroidManifest.Instead do the following:  Note this will > change the package name. The decoupling of Package Name and Application ID is explained here: The approach used by me for renaming the package name is simple as follows:- : Select the Project option from left menu of Android Studio  : Right click on java and add a new package and set the desired package name  : Enter you new packagename  :Copy all the files from your old package and paste in the new package  :Rename the package name in manifest file  :Rename the package name in build.gradle file  :Then right click the old package and delete it with all its data and delete that directory as well  :Then Rebuild your project  :Then you will find some errors of old import packagename in your project :Then a popup appears like below and select All files option from it  :Rebuild your project again bingo your project packagename has been changed :) Place your cursor in the package name like shown below. Don't select it just place it.  Then press  you will get a popup window as shown below select.(Note since my cursor is on ""something"" only something is renamed.) That's it done. Right-click on the package at the  If your package name is more than two dot separated say  you might DO the following steps to refactoring your package name(s) in Android Studio or IntelliJ: then refactor them by moving them to com and com.hello respectively.   You will see com and com.hello sitting there at the Project(   or  for shortcut) and rename directories refactoring is   waiting there as you expected. Refactor to rename one or more of these directories to reach your aim. The only thing you should notice here is you must choose the directories rather than Packages when a dialog ask you. If you've got lots of classes in your project it will take you a while to wait for its auto-scan-and-rename. Besides you need to rename the package name inside the AndroidManifest.xml manually I guess such that other names in this file can benefit the prefix.  and then insert the desired package name. 2- Open  to the desired package  name. Select option  Uncheck the Compact Empty Middle Packages option. Renaming directory crl to crl1 Finally click on Do Refactor button marked in image belowenter code here After Changes done Please try the following steps: *******Finally it’s done ******   Press  has always worked for me.Simply . It should be fine from here. The best way is to write the new package name and drag from the older package name. The second way if you click > then move option then rename the package name it will rename the package name and then rebuild. In Build.gradle you have to do manually if you Refactor then it will not rename in Build.gradle. I recommend to use the  Done!"
11,javascript - How do I get started with Node.js ,Are there any good resources to get started with Node.JS? Any good tutorials blogs or books? Of course I have visited its official website  but I didn't think the documentation they have is a good starting point. Use the source Luke. No but seriously I found that building Node.js from source running the tests and looking at the benchmarks did get me on the right track. From there the .js files in the lib directory are a good place to look especially the file http.js. Update: I wrote this answer over a year ago and since that time there has an explosion in the number of great resources available for people learning Node.js. Though I still believe diving into the source is worthwhile I think that there are now better ways to get started. I would suggest some of the books on Node.js that are starting to come out.
15,How do you split and unsplit a window/view in Eclipse IDE? ,How do you split a window/view in Eclipse IDE? I want to edit code while viewing the different code in the same file. If there is a trick to open the same file twice this might do but I would rather just split the one current view instead of having two of the same which might get confusing.This is possible with the menu items . That works on Eclipse Juno or higher.For the previous Eclipse versions check  out Simply go to Window &gt; New Window This will open up a new window of the same Workspace in eclipse.  You can open up separate files in each Window. Below are the steps to  editor horizontally or verticallygo to:  to split editor horizontally or to split editor vertically. It will open two editors side by side or will pileup tow. If you want to see two different files in same eclipse you can Right-click a tab -&gt;  to tabs again.
16,java - How to increase IDE memory limit in IntelliJ IDEA on Mac? ,"I'm using IDEA 12 Leda on Mountain Lion. I wanted to increase the maximum memory that IDE can use. I set the VMOptions in Info.plist file to be come from? I need to remove it.Since IDEA 15.0.4 you can use  is no longer recommended as the signature will not match and you will get issues depending on your system security settings (app will either not run or firewall will complain on every start or the app will not be able to use the system keystore to save passwords). As a result of addressing  a new way to supply JVM options was introduced in IDEA 12: Now it can take VM options from   and system properties  from  setting.  As for the intellij2018 version I am using the following configuration for better performance go to that path ""C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA 12.1.4\bin\idea.exe.vmoptions"" and change size to -Xmx512m hope its will work OSX 10.9 if you dont bother about signed application you might just change It looks like IDEA solves this for you (like everything else).  When loading a large project and letting it thrash it will open a dialog to up the memory settings.  Entering 2048 for Xmx and clicking ""Shutdown"" then restarting IDEA makes IDEA start up with more memory.  This seems to work well for Mac OS though it never seems to persist for me on Windows (not sure about IDEA 12). On my machine this only works in  causes the IDEA to hang during startup. Some addition to the top answer here "
20,Using Emacs as an IDE ,"Currently my workflow with Emacs when I am coding in C or C++ involves three windows.  The largest on the right contains the file I am working with.  The left is split into two the bottom being a shell which I use to type in compile or make commands and the top is often some sort of documentation or README file that I want to consult while I am working.  Now I know there are some pretty expert Emacs users out there and I am curious what other Emacs functionally is useful if the intention is to use it as a complete IDE.  Specifically most IDEs usually fulfill these functions is some form or another: For a few of these it's pretty obvious how Emacs can fit these functions but what about the rest?  Also if a specific language must be focused on I'd say it should be C++.   One user pointed out that I should have been more specific when I said 'what about the rest'.  Mostly I was curious about efficient version control as well as documentation lookup.  For example in SLIME it is fairly easy to do a quick hyperspec lookup on a Lisp function.  Is there a quick way to look up something in C++ STL documentation (if I forgot the exact syntax of  for example)?You'll have to be specific as to what you mean by ""the rest"".  Except for the object inspector (that I""m aware of) emacs does all the above quite easily: Edit: I realize my answer about documentation lookup really pertained to code navigation.  Here's some more to-the-point info:   Google searching will no doubt reveal further examples. As the second link shows looking up functions (and whatever) in other documentation can be done even if not supported out of the box. I have to recommend .  I'm also working on article about using Emacs as Development Environment for many languages - C/C++ Java Perl Lisp/Scheme Erlang etc... For version control there are several things that you can use depending on what version control system you use. But some of the functionality is common to all of them. It is pretty simple to use no need to customize your init file.You just need to start emacs in daemon mode; This will create an emacs server then you can connect it either from terminal or from gui. I'd also recommend to create some aliases to make it easy to call.  This way emacs will fire up even faster than gedit promise. The one possible problem here if you are running emacs daemon from your casual user you probably can't connect emacs server as  .  For compiling your code it's best to use shell-commands. I am working on this project  very useful.  Truly emacs can be made to do anything. In the recent years Clang became an important part of the Emacs C++ support. Atila Neves had a talk on CppCon 2015:. The other thing it has that I find useful are parsers for location messages so that if you have a call stack trace and want to edit at a particular place in the callstack this front-end interface will can do that.  By far this program could use improvement. But then it could also use people working on it to improve it.  Disclaimer: I work on realgud"
23,Can IntelliJ IDEA encapsulate all of the functionality of WebStorm and PHPStorm through plugins? ,"I am in the market for a new IDE but am confused about the overlap between some of Jetbrains' offerings. It looks like IntelliJ IDEA has plugins that allow you to do Node.js and php development.  Can IntelliJ IDEA do everything that WebStorm and PHPStorm do through plugins or do they have special features not available in IDEA? I am hoping to have a single polyglot IDE for all development.All of the functionality of our lightweight IDEs can be found within IntelliJ IDEA (you need to  Definitely a great question.I've noted this also as a sub question of the choice for versions within IDEa that this link may help to address...  it as well potentially possesses a ground work for looking at your other IDE choices and the options they provide. I'm thinking WebStorm is best for JavaScript and Git repo management meaning the HTML5 CSS Cordova kinds of stacks which is really where (I believe along with others) the future lies and energies should be focused now... but ya it depends on your needs etc. Anyway this tells that story too... intellij idea is the best IDE on market. I supports all the fetures of its lightweight IDEs like webStrom pyCham etc. It even works sama as Android Studio.There are only 2 differences1. Creation (""Open Directory"") used in lighter products2. It consumes a lot of memory processor and specially BATTERIES (as its like a super set of all ides)"
26,IDE for JavaScript development ,What do you suggest for JS development IDE. Is there something similar to VisualStudio IDE so I can run/debug my application in it?A few options: At JetBrains we've just developed lightweight  that includes very smart JavaScript Editor with DOM-based autocompletion and HTML5 API support.It allows you to debug(breakpoints supported) and run your scripts directly from IDE. I think IntellJ's JavaScript support is excellent just like everything else that they do.  Standalone or as a Eclipse plugin. The Pro version has some nice addons like the embedded IE (to the always embedded Firefox) and debugging support for both browsers.I found after hours of testing that Suns  is the best PHP and Python IDE for Windows and Linux. I was surprised that also Javascript support can hold the candle to Aptana. So Netbeans is my recommendation (not only for Javascript). Give it a try its free!  I've found  Eclipse and JSEclipse plugin and of course Firefox + Firebug the ultimate duo. You'll find this development setup satisfactory. Aptana is a great IDE as it will provide intelli-sense for CSS javascript html java etc.  The debugger gives you the choice to run in FF or IE and is a full featured debugger.  The community edition allows you to run a server side javascript as well.  A very solid and feature rich platform for free.
29,c++ - What does int argc char *argv[] mean? ,In many C++ IDE's and compilers when it generates the main function for you it looks like this: When I code C++ without an IDE just with a command line compiler I type: without any parameters.  What does this mean and is it vital to my program? syntax): If you declared your main as . There is almost always a better solution implemented through C libraries. Both of are legal definitions of the entry point for a C or C++ program.  details some of the variations that are possible or legal for your main function.
31,Good IDE for Elixir ,I am looking for an IDE that does atleast some of the following It would be nice if it could alsoThere is a a good sublime integration called  extension. This extension adds rich elixir language support to VS Code including:  elixir-tmbundle is great and highly lightweight package available for Sublime text support of Elixir Lang you can simply add it to sublime text by simply running. There is TextMate support for this package as well you can follow this link for more info. 
32,Eclipse/Java code completion not working ,"I've downloaded unzipped and setup Eclipse 3.4.2 with some plugins (noteable EPIC Clearcase QuantumDB MisterQ).  Now I find when I'm editing Java projects the code completion is not working.  If I type  and press Try  in '' An example of the kind of data you see in this preference screen however not necessarily what you currently have. if have duplicate Mylyn entries uncheck the duplicate entries that do not contain ""  Then in the : as suggested by @nhahtdh's comment adding the some more info to answer directly: IBus plugin in Xfce uses by default I faced this problem and spent hours trying to figure out the issue. tried to follow the steps mentioned in the different answers above the solution I found is on the same lines as Mona suggested but slightly different. Tried to add as a comment to Mona's answer but no option was available.Issue with my eclipse was classpath somehow got corrupted and all the jars and dependent projects were missing. after taking the latest .classpath from repository it worked fine. I had this problem and like @Marc only on a particular class.  I discovered that I needed to designate Open With = Java Editor.  As a Eclipse newbie I hadn't even realized that I was just using a plain editor. In the package explorer right-click the file and chose ""Open With"".  I also face this issue but it is resolved in different way.Steps that I follow may be helpful for others. Once you have you configuration checked and completion is still not working: Do you see the right icon beside the file?: response but the add comment only works after I have a rating of 50? not sure WTF that is... ThanksTom For me the issue was a conflict between several versions of the same library. The Eclipse assist was using an older version than maven.  I had to go to the .m2 directory and delete the unwanted lib version + restart eclipse. I experience problems on Eclipse Neon when . When I copy the same file to the project root directory not even to the src directory the completion starts working. When the file is opened from a different directory only completion for JRE works. That is for example:  does not. Just in case anyone got to a desperate point where nothing works... It happened to us that the content assist somehow shrunk so no suggestion was shown just the ""Press Ctrl+Space for non-Java..."" could be seen.So it was just a matter of dragging the corner of the content assist to enlarge the pop-up. I know embarrassing. Hope it helps. Note: this was an Ubuntu server with Xfce4 using Eclipse Oxygen.  eclipse version so I assume the auto-complete feature does not migrated correctly during the upgrade process. The only solution that worked for me was to create a new eclipse workspace and import the project/s to it. It might take a few minutes but it worth it - comparing to the time spent on other solutions... "

35,debugging - IDE and Debugger for node.js ,I am going to start building project in node.js (was working in PHP before) What is the IDE Debugger and Helping Tools for node.js to help improvement while coding ?There are several IDEs which support Node.js natively: WebStorm 3.0 does all this stuff.It auto completes in a smart way includes nice debugging and unit testing. It also include number of inspection for javascript which is also pleasant.Now RC version is available but JetBrains assure that it'll be released soon.  I use IntelliJ's Webstorm:  for it's advance auto-complete features and Node.js/NodeUnit templates.
36,java.io.Console support in Eclipse IDE ,"I use the Eclipse IDE to develop compile and run my Java projects. Today I'm trying to use the  when an application is run ""through"" Eclipse. Eclipse run the program on a background process rather than a top-level process with the console window we're familiar with. Is there a way to force Eclipse to run the program as a top level process or at least create a Console that the JVM will recognize? Otherwise I'm forced to jar the project up and run on a command-line environment external to Eclipse.I assume you want to be able to use step-through debugging from Eclipse. You can just run the classes externally by setting the built classes in the bin directories on the JRE classpath. You can debug using the remote debugger and taking advantage of the class files built in your project. In this example the Eclipse project structure looks like this:  So all you have to do any time you want to debug the app is: You can track this issue in  offers alternatives to using System.console(). One is to use a BufferedReader wrapped around System.in the second is to use a Scanner wrapped around System.in.  Neither are as concise as console but both work in eclipse without having to resort to debug silliness! Let's say your Eclipse workspace is C:\MyWorkspace you created your java application inside a maven project MyProject and your Java main class is com.mydomain.mypackage.MyClass. In this case you can run your main class that uses  on the command line: NB1: if it's not in a maven project check the output folder in project properties | Java Build Path | Source. It might not be ""target/classes"" NB2: if it is a maven project but your class is in src/test/java you'll likely have to use ""target\test-classes"" instead of ""target\classes"""
37,Changing API level Android Studio ,"I want to change the minimum SDK version in Android Studio from API 12 to API 14. I have tried changing it in the manifest file i.e. and rebuilding the project but I still get the Android Studio IDE throwing up some errors. I presume I have to set the min SDK in 'project properties' or something similar so the IDE recognizes the change but I can't find where this is done in Android Studio.When you want to update your minSdkVersion in an existent project... An example of build.gradle: For beginners in Android Studio ""Sync gradle button"" is located in  Tools -&gt; Android -&gt; Sync Project with Gradle Files ""Rebuild project""  Build -&gt; Rebuild Project  Though this question was already answered but Android Studio has changed a little bit by its stable release.

In Android studio open build.gradle and edit the following section: here you can change minSdkVersion from 12 to 14 Changing the minSdkVersion in the manifest is not necessary. If you change it in the gradle build file as seen below you accomplish what you need to do.  For me what worked was: (right click)project-&gt;android tools-&gt;clear lint markers. Although for some reason the Manifest reverted to the old (lower) minimum API level but after I changed it back to the new (higher) API level there was no red error underline and the project now uses the new minimum API level. Edit: Sorry I see you were using Android Studio not Eclipse. But I guess there is a similar 'clear lint markers' in Studio somewhere and it might solve the problem.

41,emacs - Best Common Lisp IDE ,I've used Slime within Emacs as my primary development environment for Common Lisp (or Aquamacs on OS X) but are there other compelling choices out there? I've heard about Lispworks but is that [or something else] worth looking at? Or does anyone have tips to getting the most out of Emacs (e.g. hooking it up to the hyperspec for easy reference)? Update: Section 7 of Pascal Costanza's . More resources:There are some flashier options out there but I don't think anything's better than  I use Vim the Ion3 window manager and terminal windows and enjoy it very much.
45,Best Fortran IDE ,"Is there anybody using Fortran on stackoverflow? What IDE do you use and which one do you think to be the best? Seems lots of people surround me are quite inconvenient with Intel Visual Fortran. Because there is no support for intellisense refactoring etc.Well as others already mentioned you could use instead of an IDE a separate text editor. Several come to mind;   VIM (or one of the family) - great editing capabilities very customizable. Unfortunatelly it is still an editor not an IDE. It can be customized in a variety of ways of course but that gets boring after a while.  Also it's syntax highlighting capabilities are somewhat wrongly made. Also has some problems/confusions with free/fixed format and f77/f90/f95 ...   Emacs - pretty much same advantages/shortcomings as the above.   In general editors like the above mentioned can be used but in that case it is best to choose one from the start and stick to it; modifying your work habits as you go; since customizing everything can be time consuming to suit your needs. Most editors have problems with fortran's syntax since they're used to C's (where everything that ""opens"" has a ""close""). As far as IDE's goes your options are not that great:   > What about these ones: . I do not like Code::Blocks... We use an in-house extension to visual studio to get code completion for our fortran code and to assist us with debugging. But even so there is a lot of room for improvement. Our main issues are:  We used Sun workshop and it was very good but there is no windows version. jedit has a nice fortran mode and you can define keybindings for the compiler and debugger.for small to medium sized projects it is quite nice. it also has svn and multiple files search. also very nice is hypersearch where you get a list of you matches and you can go to the position with a single click. another goodie is a plugin for gdb and for ctags. you can very easily script all functions using jython. it feels a little bit like a modern version of emacs that uses python instead of lisp. check out the plugin manager. it lets you download all the plugins from the server and installs them for you (like in eclipse).

46,javascript - Is there an IDE with explicit support for AngularJS? ,"I've tried WebStorm but there only seems to be a basic JavaScript support there like in any other web IDE I have tried. I'm looking for something that would allow me to click-through from HTML pages to Controllers etc. If the answer is ""no"" to this question is there any other JavaScript framework similar to Angular that would have something like an Eclipse plugin or any other kind of explicit support in some IDE?John Lindquist says he'll make a plugin for WebStorm: Also for Microsoft VisualStudio AngularUI have written plugins that offer full AngularJS (and optionally AngularUI) IDE support for Sublime Text 2 &amp; 3 and TextMate text editors.

47,What's a good IDE for Erlang programming? ,"As far as I know there's Erlang plugin for NetBeans and Eclipse. Which one has the upper hand at the moment?  Are there any other IDE for Erlang which I didnt mention and how good are they when compare with NetBeans and Eclipse? The best IDE for Erlang is Emacs. However the mode which ships with Erlang isn't the best. ). Pros:Syntax highlight autocompletion and suggestion all work well.During suggest it will display some documentationif available: very useful when exploring a module. Error and warning annotiations are quick and helpful. All things considered the user experience is good especially if you are used to eclipse. Cons:Erlide can also run your modules but I find the shell is too clunky to be usable. I always keep a ""real"" erlang shell open and compile/test my code from there. There is also a Textmate bundle (google) but I have not tried that yet. Erlang mode in Emacs is the generally recommended IDE.  and Vimthey are good enough for developing.Geany can also compile and run the code. . I'm using sublime text on windows mac and linux Emacs or VIM is not a good choice if you didn't have experience on them.There a too many bugs in Eclipse...And IntelliJ IDEA is the best IDE"
48,Inefficient jQuery usage warnings in PHPStorm IDE ,I recently upgraded my version of PHPStorm IDE and it now warns me about inefficient jQuery usage. For example: Prompts this warning: Checks that jQuery selectors are used in an efficient way. It suggests  to split descendant selectors which are prefaced with ID selector and  warns about duplicated selectors which could be cached. So my question is: Why is this inefficient and what is the efficient way to do the above selector? I'd guess at: Is this the right way?I had the same question today and was able to find a solution thanks to  There was some discussion about this on jQuery forums but its 3 years old:As they point out here if you are doing a lot of operations on same id selector the greatest performance improvement is found by caching the top level element.On the other hand if you are doing just a few selections there is going to be virtually no performance difference. Therefor I believe that IntelliJ is overstating the importance of this code style.  The first question is to hit Alt+Enter and select the first tip in the list then hit Enter you'll see what it thinks the most efficient way.
49,Which IDE for Scala 2.8? ," is the same question for older version of Scala but they say that Eclipse plugin has been improved vastly. Is it the best IDE now? How do different Scala IDE compare today? I've been pretty successful with IDEA 9. I've briefly tried both Netbeans and Eclipse and wasn't able to get what I wanted. Eclipse's code-complete didn't behave as well as I'd have liked and I couldn't find a way to make Netbeans handle Scala scripts; It'd just complain that the file wasn't a class. To be clear I've been using IDEA for a few years for Java so keep that in mind:) For the moment Scala Plugin in IntelliJ IDEA is the best. It handles Scala 2.8 well. IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition is now free and open source (and works with Scala) so I can't see any reason for not using it. The plugin is still somewhat buggy (many ""false negatives"" i.e. the code without red underscores may not compile successfully; but almost no ""false positives"") but perfectly usable. The best thing is that you can use IDEA's excellent debugger with Scala (not without some issues but it actually works!). FSC (Fast Scala Compiler) is also supported in latest builds. A huge time-saver. The plugin development team is quite responsive. Some of the guys work directly in JetBrains and possess intimate knowledge about IDEA platform so the development progresses fast. JetBrains IDEA's Scala plug-in handles 2.7 and 2.8 equally well. I cannot make any comparisons because I have used only IDEA. Using Eclipse Helios with the dev-version of the new Scala(2.8) plugin as there isn't an official release yet. That > beta definitively -- but I can't confirm the frequently expressed opinion that this plugin is outright horrible ;-) I'd say the experience is already OK-ish and indeed better than the current state of affairs with the Groovy plugin. OTOH the experience with plain Java is way more smooth (feels like flying at times) and the current CDT I'd rate somewhat in between. Incremental compile and error highlighting work quite well for me; tweaking a DSL implementation into form just by continuously rewriting your code until the error markers are gone -- without ever having to test-run your program -- is outright fun and just again shows that FP / static typing rocks! Problems encountered from time to time:- implicits and nested types in other compilation units (esp. nested / super packages) aren't picked up at times when there are still other errors around; they will be picked up after an full build- there seems to be a memory leak in the version I'm using right now (from end august 2010) necessitating to restart the workbench after some hours of work- beware when you're using AspectJ to make sure you get a version of the Scala plugin which relies on a JDT weaving bundle version which also works with AJDT PS: I'm using maven builds in all my projects and generated the eclipse projects with the eclipse-maven-plugin and then imported them as plain-flat eclipse projects. I can just strongly recommend everyone to keep away from the M2-eclipse plugin (for maven) in its current (2010) state it makes your workbench painfully slow is buggy and has lots of almost unpredictable behaviour because it constantly tries to do magic things behind the scenes (and besides that the aspectj support is broken since this spring) i use both eclipse and IDEA eclipse supports type detection isbetter than IDEA (it is veryneccessery thing if you want programin functional style that you can beaware from type of expressions andvariables.) : IDEA supports type detection like eclipse but you haveto define a value in your functionsfor example: deftestTs[A](a:List[String]b:List[A])= for{      ai &lt;- a      bi &lt;- b    }  yield (aibi)   }deftestTs[A](a:List[String]b:List[A]):List[(StringA)]={    val result = for{      ai &lt;- a      bi &lt;- b    }  yield (aibi)   }I think that the best option so far is the ScalaIDE for Eclipse. You can go to the ScalaIDE Web Site and look around to see by yourself.  to get an idea. For everyone who is really considering doing some serious development with Scala I strongly recommend to evaluate the IDEs in question beyond the basics. When you are into an agile approach which in my option requires a painless refactoring support without surprises (especially in multi-module projects) things are pretty tight at the moment. It would be pretty neat if someone came up with a IDE independent specification-like list of refactorings (and desired outcomes) which could be used to verify an IDE's refactoring support. The officially endorsed and supported (by Typesafe) for Scala 2.9 is Eclipse. The current version is far superior to prior versions and includes a context-aware REPL full-featured debugger and even the ability to debug REPL statements.  I think this question needs to be updated and the answers revisited. I don't recommend the Scala IDE/Eclipse.  It doesn't have a lot of the features that are even available for Eclipse with Java.  And there are bugs. I am using the latest NetBeans and haven't tried anything else. I've met at least 2 notable bugs in NetBeans while coding in Scala: One: NB occasionally come unable to run a program hanging on classpath scanning.Solution: Create a new project copy your code there and go on.Comment:  of particular namespaces or classes and complains when you use them.Solution: Just ignore and go on - compiler founds no errors and the program works. I'd recommend IDEA's plugin for now. The Scala plugin for NetBeans is quite nice too. It doesn't yet support NetBeans 6.9 the newest release though and you still need to download it manually instead of installing it directly from the plugin manager inside NetBeans.  However it integrates better with Maven projects than IDEA's plugin does (this is true for NB and IDEA in general in my opinion). It partly depends on your style of working as all the options have strengths and weaknesses. If you need refactoring across mixed java/scala projects then IntelliJ is your only option. If you want to do any work on the compiler or a compiler plugin then Eclipse has the advantage of being able to launch a runtime workspace with a custom compiler build including breakpoints.  It also improved massively for the 2.8 Scala release. Netbeans is a fine choice to go with if you're already very familiar with that platform the costs of learning a new environment may well outweigh any benefits and all three solutions are improving rapidly. I haven't tried netbeans scala plugin yet but I find that Intellij IDEA plugin is at any way much better a scala ide than the Scala eclipse plugin which is sooooo slow that drives me crazy.Though swing applications don't work well with my tiling window manager. try IDEAX the latest community edition of Intellij IDEA (version 10) it has improved scala plugin which has faster code compilation and exceution in addition to that it has Maven3 and SBT support with which we can develop Lift applications. IntelliJ IDEA community edition + Scala Plugin + SBT plugin"
52,Choosing an IDE/Editor for Clojure coding ,"I'm looking for an editor or an IDE for my Clojure coding and I found this thread: However I have a couple of questions:Which IDE offers the best Clojure environment (right now): IntelliJ Eclipse or NetBeans?What are the advantages of Aquamacs (I read Rick is using it) over the previous heavy-weight IDEs?I have spent significant chunks of time (on a Mac) with: My opinions on those: > - The Eclipse editor is coming along and the structural editing has some of the niceties of paredit (but not the truly essential slurp barf splice capability).  The Eclipse repl is just a stock command-line repl and is pretty bad in comparison to NetBeans.  However the NetBeans remote repl has been broken out into an independent project and is coming very soon to Eclipse which will make Eclipse even more attractive.  Maven integration is very good.  I use Eclipse now when I want to see lots of files and projects at once which I have a hard time doing in Emacs. At the moment my bet is that the Eclipse tooling will start to pull away from the others.  But I'm still hoping for a Clojure-specific IDE to show up. :)      The world has changed a lot since I first wrote this. There are now at least 6 very good Clojure environments. If you have not allegiance to a pre-existing editor and want an easy place to start there are two great choices: 1)  There you can see most of the keyboard shortcuts. Sublime Text with Paredit and SublimeREPL is a quite a good option. Sublime Text is a powerful and light weight editor. It enjoys a big umbrella of plugins. Agree with Alex. I have tried NetBeansEmacs Textmate and Eclipse on OSX. For now Eclipse is a better choice. BTW it also depends on your background. If you are a Java programmer Eclipse is a very good choice. Sometimes I use the REPL - for example to try out Clojure 1.3 Alpha3.We do need a Clojure-specific IDE; something like Komodo. There is a new Clojure plugin for Intellij called .   Unfortunately it looks like . Make sure you can get emacs.app for mac.  According to the writer:""The reason I recommend Emacs is that it offers tight integration with a Clojure REPL which allows you to instantly try out your code as you write. That kind of tight feedback loop will be useful while learning Clojure and later when writing real Clojure programs. Emacs is also great for working with any Lisp dialect; in fact Emacs is written in a Lisp dialect called Emacs Lisp (elisp).""."
54,php - PHPDoc type hinting for array of objects? ,"So in PHPDoc one can specify  doesn't seem to be valid for example. The best you can do is say I do that a lot in Zend Studio. Don't know about other editors but it ought to work. In the PhpStorm IDE from JetBrains you can use  is not necessary. . I prefer to read and write clean code - as outlined in ""Clean Code"" by Robert C. Martin.When following his credo you should not require the developer (as user of your API) to know the (internal) structure of your array.  The API user may ask: Is that an array with one dimension only? Are the objects spread around on all levels of a multi dimensional array? How many nested loops (foreach etc.) do i need to access all objects? What type of objects are ""stored"" in that array? As you outlined you want to use that array (which contains objects) as a one dimensional array.  As outlined by Nishi you can use: for that.  But again: be aware - this is not a standard docblock notation. This notation was introduced by some IDE producers.  Okay okay as a developer you know that ""[]"" is tied to an array in PHP. But what do a ""something[]"" mean in normal PHP context? ""[]"" means: create new element within ""something"". The new element could be everything. But what you want to express is: array of objects with the same type and it´s exact type. As you can see the IDE producer introduces a new context. A new context you had to learn. A new context other PHP developers had to learn (to understand your docblocks). Bad style (!). Because your array do have one dimension you maybe want to call that ""array of objects"" a ""list"". Be aware that ""list"" has a very special meaning in other programming languages. It would be mutch better to call it ""collection"" for example. Remember: you use a programming language that enables you all options of OOP.Use a class instead of an array and make your class traversable like an array. E.g.: Or if you want to store the internal objects on different levels within an multi dimensional array/object structure: This solution replaces your array by an object of type ""orderCollection"" but do not enable code completion within your IDE so far. Okay. Next step: Implement the methods that are introduced by the interface with docblocks - particular:  Do not forget to use type hinting for: This solution stops introducing a lot of: all over your code files (e.g. within loops) as Zahymaka confirmed with her/his answer. Your API user is not forced to introduce that docblocks to have code completion. To have @return on only one place reduces the redundancy (@var) as mutch as possible. Sprinkle ""docBlocks with @var"" would make your code worst readable. Finaly you are done. Looks hard to achive? Looks like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Not realy since you are familiar with that interfaces and with clean code. Remember: your source code is written once / read many. If code completion of your IDE do not work with this approach switch to a better one (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA PhpStorm Netbeans) or file a feature request on the issue tracker of your IDE producer. Thanks to Christian Weiss (from Germany) for being my trainer and for teaching me such a great stuff. PS: Meet me and him on XING.  Now usage of classes: Once again: I suspect not all IDE support it but PhpStorm does. Try yours post in comment the results! I know I'm late to the party but I've been working on this problem recently.  I hope someone sees this because the accepted answer although correct is > the best way you can do this.  Not in PHPStorm at least I haven't tested NetBeans though. The best way involves extending the ArrayIterator class rather than using native array types.  This allows you to type hint at a class-level rather than at an instance-level meaning you only have to PHPDoc once not throughout your code (which is not only messy and violates DRY but can also be problematic when it comes to refactoring - PHPStorm has a habit of missing PHPDoc when refactoring) See code below: The key here is the PHPDoc  to signify ""an array of Foo's"" but it's not supported by IDE's. I've found something which is working it can save lives !"
55,Does Google Chrome work with Selenium IDE (as Firefox does)? ,I can't find an equivalent of Selenium IDE that works with Chrome. Does anyone know the way to use Selenium IDE works with Chrome instead of Firefox? Or is there any alternative tool which can work with Chrome?artejera do you mean Selenium as plugin to your browser (Selenium IDE)?Here is . Katalon Studio is a free Selenium IDE alternative. Our team has used it before and it has some advantages over Selenium IDE: Whatever tool you choose there are some criteria you should pay attention to: you can use Google chrome extensions like imacros scirocco on chrome 21 or later versions. they are similar to selenium IDE for Firefox. Scirocco seems to be new with some limitations like navigation is not supported. So I recommend 'imacros' seems very close to selenium. If you want to harness Selenium IDE record &amp; playback capabilities for Chrome browser there is an equivalent extension for Chrome called Scirocco.You can add it to Chrome by visiting here using your Chrome browser 
56,clang-based cross-platform C++ IDE? ,The  C++ compiler claims to be built for among other things better IDE integration by providing an API for the IDE to use for tasks such as parsing the code. So are there are any good C++ IDE's that use clang to provide features such as semantic highlighting refactoring and finding and showing semantic errors in real-time? I've been using Eclipse CDT but its C++ parser is full of imperfections that cause the IDE to report a lot of annoying false positive errors in the code. I would like to have an IDE that reports an error if and only if the compiler would report the same error hence my interest in an IDE that's built on a compiler's internals. I'm primarily interested in cross-platform IDE's although I wouldn't mind knowing about single-platform ones for Windows or Linux (so  Xcode).Qt Creator is basing their next-gen code parsing and associated functionality on Clang:  Clearly advertises libclang backend as a main feature.
57,Professional VHDL IDE? ,Is there a good IDE to work with VHDL projects ?Or are most of the professionals working with emacs/vim/notepad++ ?I use Emacs+VHDL-mode which is great if you don't mind (or have already climbed) the learning curve of Emacs. Alternatively you could try  for simulation. But I am no professional so I suppose they are using some of the former two products. Engineers in large semiconductor companies are using emacs/vim for code editing. Integrated Development Environment doesn't make much sense there since a > is a few thousand HDL files taken from different places on a *NIX network setup scripts for a dozen different tools and cron jobs to do frequent builds. For simpler FPGA projects developed on Windows I've seen people using Borland CodeWright UltraEdit and Crimson Editor.     My best bet is to use VIM to do whatever i need to for VHDL formatting. VIM has an extremely powerful facility to develop custom plugins and no amount of IDE hopping will give you all the customization you would ever need.  Things like signal names &lt; 20 characters procedure lengths &lt; 100 lines no use of linkage ports -- all of these can be coded in VIM with minimal effort. You could actually run vcom or ncvhdl from within VIM and then see where the errors are.  Having said all this you might want to take a look at what Sigasi has to offer. If you need more help on this let me know -- it'd be fun coding a VIM plugin.  Emacs + VHDL mode + a compiler / simulator + source control. The VHDL mode is configured to use the compiler to compile the design and optionally run the simulation. Emacs can link with the source control to correctly check in diff and tag. I personally like this set up because the editor is open source and I can use it anywhere (Mac Linux Windows). The compiler / simulator can be anything from a free download (FPGA vendor sponsored Modelsim or GHDL) to a grid engine. Once set up it pretty much becomes invisible. Simplifide also has an eclipse plugin which supports VHDL Verilog and SystemVerilog which contains all of the standard IDE features and more.  It can be downloaded at . It's a plugin I'm working on that provides syntax checking based on simulators/compilers. I'm using daily with ModelSim and so far works nice. Emacs with the appropriate language mode is my vote. Basic editing is easy enough to learn and there are a lot of example config files out there.Kevin. I'm using Xilinx ISE for educational purposes it works really well. And it has everything. After applying for a student license the student version it free to use but it takes up a lot of space. The installation file alone is more than 6 gb. The book we use for school is referring to xilinx special properties. (“FGPA Prototyping by VHDL Examples”). I'm also programming on a nexsys 3 spartan 6 testboard and I'll be using xilinx for another year but when I finish the course I’m gonna look for something smaller. Happy to read about the lightweight alternatives.

77,intellij idea - Managing keyboard shortcut conflicts between IDE and OS (Ubuntu) ,"I'm using IntelliJ IDEA but I think this applies to any IDE. In IDEA some  conflict with Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts. Some examples: I've been using Ubuntu for a long time and I'm used to these shortcuts. I use them all the time to switch between workspaces lock my session... At the same time I know how useful the IntelliJ shortcuts can be and I want to avoid using the mouse as much as possible. Currently my workaround for ""format source code"" is I use Ubuntu as well and I disabled the native (Ubuntu) command  to format the code and  for navigating backward Hope this helps This works for me in Ubuntu Studio 14.04 (XFCE): In order to disable XUbuntu's (xfce) keymap for  and I used .  Here I was able to clear these mappings. From the link to feature request provided by CrazyCoder: Actually there are several bundled schemes: ""Default for GNOME"" ""Default for KDE"" created exactly for that purpose.  I have not checked now particular shortcuts like Ctrl+Alt+L but these schemes were created to avoid conflicts with GNOME and KDE respectively. ""Default for Gnome"" did the trick for me (I'm on ArchLinux Gnome3 AndroidStudio/InteliJ) it remapped Navigate/Back to Shift+Alt+Left (was Ctrl+Alt+Left from ""Default for XWin"" and it didn't work). But now it switches may keyboard layout as well (Shift+Alt) another problem )) Probably I'll remap keypad switcher to something else it is still simpler then reassigning all the conflicting keys in IDE/OS. In 'Settings' section 'Keymap' you can choose the keymaps template from XWin Gnome Visual Studio Eclipse etc... This solve any problem in Ubuntu by choosing Gnome."

88,Is Matlab an IDE? ,"I'm a little confused as to what classifies as an IDE. According to Wikipedia: An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. So is MatLab considered an IDE? As with many things in software there are no hard rules. But if anything fits the description of IDE matlab does.  The basic engine can be run purely from the command line but when you marry that with the graphical environment it has all the hallmarks of an IDE - richly featured text editor debugging support memory/workspace introspection etc etc.  In some ways the IDE is what you pay for. Minus that there's little advantage over open source numerical languages like Python or Julia.  MatLab workbooks could be considered and IDE. Depending how you define ""comprehensive facilities"" Vim is an IDE."
89,java - How to call a SOAP web service on Android ,"I am having a lot of trouble finding good information on how to call a standard SOAP/WSDL web service with Android. All I've been able to find are either very convoluted documents and references to ""kSoap2"" and then some bit about parsing it all manually with  based web service from an Android-based phone.Android does not provide any sort of SOAP library. You can either write your own or use something like . As you note others have been able to compile and use kSOAP2 in their own projects but I haven't had to. Google has shown to date little interest in adding a SOAP library to Android. My suspicion for this is that they'd rather support the current trends in Web Services toward REST-based services and using JSON as a data encapsulation format. Or using XMPP for messaging. But that is just conjecture. XML-based web services are a slightly non-trivial task on Android at this time. Not knowing NetBeans I can't speak to the tools available there but I agree that a better library should be available. It is possible that the XmlPullParser will save you from using SAX but I don't know much about that.  comes in the Android SDK by default. That'll get you connected to the WSDL. It's true that due to it's overhead SOAP is not the best choice for data exchange with mobile devices. However you might find yourself in situation in which you do not control the format of server output. So if you have to stick with SOAP there is a kSOAP2 library patched for Android here: Basically it allows you to build up envelopes to send via a simple Java API then automatically parses them into objects that you define via XPath... for example: Becomes: I was using it for my own project but I figured it might help some other people so I've spent some time separating it out and documenting it. I'd really love it if some of your poor souls who stumble on this thread while googling ""SOAP Android"" could give it a go and get some benefit. DON'T FORGET TO ADD ksoap2.jar in your project and also add the  INTERNET permission in AndroidManifest file I had my tryst with KSOAP; I chose a rather simpler approach. Given a WSDL file create SOAP Request templates for each Request(for e.g.: using SOAP UI) and then substitute the values to be passed in code. POST this data to the service end point using DefaultHttpClient instance and get the response stream. Parse the Response Stream using an XML Pull parser. You can have a look at  It supports quite complex web services and uses ksoap2. I would suggest checking out a very useful tool that helped me a lot.

95,IDE for Grinder scripting ,I'm looking for a IDE for the Grinder framework 3.11. Can someone please suggest me an IDE to develop and run Grinder(3.11) scripts. Grinder-stone for eclipse is no longer supported. Unfortunately there are no good IDE options today for doing fully-integrated Grinder script development.  Nothing has come along to fill Grinderstone's shoes.  Your best bet is to go with a decent Java/Python/Jython development tool such as PyDev or PyCharm or IntelliJ.  It won't have the Grinder integration but any of these tools will be helpful for everything else. I was in your shoes few days back however you need to configure pydev which will save a lot of time . You can integrated Grinder on your own by creating a bat file and giving the path of scripts to the one in eclipse . This worked for me.

108,eclipse - How do you debug PHP scripts? ,"How do you debug  (in terms of fast and easy) way to debug in phpStorm or any other IDE?Try  which I never used. I use Netbeans with XDebug. Check it out at its website for docs on how to configure it.  The add-on is essential when you debug MVC projects because the normal way XDebug runs in Netbeans is to register the dbug session via the url. With the add-on installed in FireFox you would set your Netbeans project properties -&gt; Run Configuratuion -&gt; Advanced and select ""Do Not Open Web Browser"" You can now set your break points and start the debugging session with Ctrl-F5 as usual. Open FireFox and right-click the Add-on icon in the right bottom corner to start monitoring for breakpoints. When the code reaches the breakpoint it will stop and you can inspect your variable states and call-stack. Output buffering is very useful if you don't want to mess up your output. I do this in a one-liner which I can comment/uncomment at will  PhpEdit has a built in debugger but I usually end up using echo(); and print_r(); the old fashioned way!! For the really gritty problems that would be too time consuming to use print_r/echo to figure out I use my IDE's (PhpEd) debugging feature.  Unlike other IDEs I've used PhpEd requires pretty much no setup.  the only reason I don't use it for any problems I encounter is that it's > slow.  I'm not sure that slowness is specific to PhpEd or any php debugger.  PhpEd is not free but I believe it uses one of the open-source debuggers (like XDebug previously mentioned) anyway.  The benefit with PhpEd again is that it requires no setup which I have found really pretty tedious in the past. Manual debugging is generally quicker for me -  in the tmp folder and tail it in the terminal with the command... It give's you running dialog from cake of what is going on which is pretty handy if you want to output something to it mid code you can use. This can usually give you a good idea of what is going on/wrong. print_r( debug_backtrace() ); or something like that :-) Komodo IDE works well with xdebug even for the remore debugging. It needs minimum amount of configuration. All you need is a version of php that Komodo can use locally to step through the code on a breakpoint. If you have the script imported into komodo project then you can set breakpoints with a mouse-click just how you would set it inside eclipse for debugging a java program.Remote debugging is obviously more tricky to get it to work correctly ( you might have to map the remote url with a php script in your workspace ) than a local debugging setup which is pretty easy to configure if you are on a MAC or a linux desktop. Nusphere is also a good debugger for php There are many PHP debugging techniques that can save you countless hours when coding. An effective but basic debugging technique is to simply turn on error reporting. Another slightly more advanced technique involves using print statements which can help pinpoint more elusive bugs by displaying what is actually going onto the screen. PHPeclipse is an Eclipse plug-in that can highlight common syntax errors and can be used in conjunction with a debugger to set breakpoints. and also used In a production environment I log relevant data to the server's error log with error_log(). i use zend studio for eclipse with the built in debugger. Its still slow compared to debugging with eclipse pdt with xdebug. Hopefully they will fix those issues the speed has improved over the recent releases but still stepping over things takes 2-3 seconds.The zend firefox toolbar really makes things easy (debug next page current page etc). Also it provides a profiler that will benchmark your code and provide pie-charts execution time etc. The most of bugs can be found easily by simply ing some of key variables but it obviously depends on what kind of application you develop. For a more complex algorithms the step/breakpoint/watch functions are very helpful (if not necessary) The Interactive Stepthrough PHP Debugger implemented as a SAPI module which can give give you complete control over the environment without impacting the functionality or performance of your code. It aims to be a lightweight powerful easy to use debugging platform for PHP 5.4+ and it's shipped out-of-box with PHP 5.6. Features includes: See the screenshots:  at php.net +1 for print_r(). Use it to dump out the contents of an object or variable. To make it more readable do it with a pre tag so you don't need to view source.  Also var_dump($thing) - this is very useful to see the type of subthings Depending on the issue I like a combination of error_reporting(E_ALL) mixed with echo tests (to find the offending line/file the error happened in initally; you KNOW it's not always the line/file php tells you right?) IDE brace matching (to resolve ""Parse error: syntax error unexpected $end"" issues) and print_r(); exit; dumps (real programmers view the source ;p).  You also can't beat phpdebug (check sourceforge) with ""memory_get_usage();"" and ""memory_get_peak_usage();"" to find the problem areas. The integrated debuggers where you can watch the values of variable change as you step through code are really cool. They do however require software setup on the server and a certain amount of configuration on the client. Both of which require periodic maintenance to keep in good working order. A print_r is easy to write and is guaranteed to work in any setup. Usually I find create a custom log function able to save on file store debug info and eventually re-print on a common footer. You can also override common Exception class so that this type of debugging is semi-automated."
111,Why would a Delphi programmer use Lazarus as the IDE instead of using Delphi's IDE? ,I've been very happy with the Delphi IDE for programming in Delphi.  But I've heard about the  says: The first thing to do when converting  a Delphi project  Having opened  Lazarus you should go to to Tools and  then Convert Delphi Project to Lazarus  Project. This won't do everything for  you but nonetheless will take you a  good deal of the way. Note that the  Lazarus IDE's conversion tools are  generally one-way conversions. If you  need to retain Delphi compatibility so  you can compile your project with both  Delphi and Lazarus consider  converting your files with the XDev  ToolkitWell a Delphi programmer cannot use Lazarus to write Delphi code because Lazarus is not Delphi. Lazarus is actually an IDE and a bunch of Delphi-ish class libraries for Free Pascal. But note things like Delphi's VCL is not there and to be perfectly blunt the IDE and debugging experiences in Lazarus are pretty spotty however it is free so that counts for a lot. Bottom line Delphi &lt;&gt; Lazarus. Use Delphi if you want a great IDE and debugger huge 3rd party support and tech suport you are targeting MS Windows plus you are willing to pay for it. Use Lazarus (free pascal) if you want a Free IDE that supports multiple platforms and has a Delphi-ish syntax. Ok. This is an old thread but could do with some updating. I stopped using Delphi maybe a decade ago largely because I had no choice. Having spent 5+ years working as a Delphi coder I was now a student again and the prices for Delphi were simply outrageous.  The problem with Delphi was never Delphi. Delphi was a genius system but Borland (and later its successors) completely misunderstood the changing computer world. Microsoft was able to deliver a programming environment that you could download for free and its .NET environment was comparable with the VCL in all the important ways meanwhile even a basic version of Delphi would break your bank or be plain out unavailable to student budgets. The end result is that with no new Delphi programmers coming on-line it became a risky proposition for businesses to continue to use. Finally with the rise of linux Kylix turned out to be a total trainwreck of an environment not utilizing available UI toolchains and with a suspicious stench of Wine pervading it topped off with an insulting attitude to GPL software that treated it as if it was shareware. Finally when Turbo Delphi came out many years later it was unable to utilize the amazing resources available via sites like tories component sites. It was clear Borland had no respect at all for its coder ecosystem. So Lazarus seemed to emerge out of all this taking a very long time to gestate and seemingly aiming at some sort of analogue to Delphi 4 held by many to be one of the cleanest and neatest in the Delphi line. It complied to just about everything its implementation of Object Pascal was spot-on and most importantly it was free in all the senses that matter to open source. However it has had a long history of bugginess and incomplete implementations of its controls. And this was bit of a deal breaker for me and many others. With that said I recently decided to download it out of curiosity and found that it's actually come a hell of a long way. The database components just work although you might need to follow a few tutorials and chase some leads around to get them all up and running and serious progress has been made towards iPhone and Android build targets.  I'm not sure I'm ready to deploy this to any of my commercial clients yet but I'm going to give it another run with a personal project to put it through its paces and if it does work I think I'm finally going to be re-united with my first programming love Pascal and in a matter that lets me use my Mac to do the heavy lifting whilst providing Windows and Linux builds.  So basically here are the facts on the comparison;-Lazarus and Delphi are totally separate entities. Lazarus is NOT a cross compiler for Delphi but has a certain degree of compatibility. Its more like GCC vs MS C++. Delphi is more polished and likely more stable.Lazarus provides a Delphi 4 like environment that old-hand Delphi coders will find very comfortable.but Lazarus can be temperamental at times and Delphi programmers need to understand that not everything in the latest and greatest Delphis will be there for them.Delphi does Windows and it does it very well (yes I know the new one has some cross compilation targets but word on the street is that it's a bit hacky and needs some time in the embacardo cooker before it's really there) whilst Lazarus complies to almost everything. The current target list is;- Darwin NetBSD OpenBSD FreeBSD Linux Solaris Win32 Win64 WinCE go32v2 (I think that's MS-DOS with 32bit extensions!) OS2 Netware(!) BEOS Haiku(?!) QNX wdosx(?) emx netwlibc Atari Amiga Palm-os Gameboy advance nds MacOS Morphos Plus there's experimental support for IOS and Android. On top of this the thing can use widget sets from  QT GTK GTK2 Win32/WIn64 Carbon fpGUI(no idea) Cocoa or no GUI at all with various degrees of implementation transparency.  Its an exhaustive list!  So Caveat Emptor. I strongly recommend Delphi coders download this and do some personal projects to get a feel for it not on the boss' dime but there's a lot of depth and substance to Lazarus and it's potentially a vital tool in the belt for dealing with life outside the Windows crib. Plus since Delphi's new masters still haven't learned a !@#$%^&amp;* thing about why Delphi fell from grace (Hint make it affordable or free to hobbyists and students to learn and create custom components)  it's really the only budget option available. If Embarcadero ever wake up maybe that will change. Until then viva Lazarus. The two main reasons for me are 1) Multiplatforms support (Linux Mac OS X Windows)  2) The price $0 Maybe I'm just reading this wrong but you seem to be under the impression that the IDEs are somehow interchangeable.  That's not correct.  Lazarus is built on top of the FPC compiler and is tied to it in much the same way that Delphi is tied to the DCC compiler.  Also they use different form description file formats.  Delphi can't read LFMs and Lazarus can try to read DFMs but it doesn't do a particularly good job of it. FPC/Lazarus is very similar to Delphi but it's a different dialect of Object Pascal and it would be a mistake to think they're equivalent. Lazarus is cross-platform and free both as in speech and beer while Delphi is neither. Lazarus does use a  is a powerful one click installation package for cross platform native Delphi like RAD/IDE based on Lazarus/FreePascal that eliminates painful cross platform setup. You can start coding just few minutes after the download so if cross platform 64 bits or price are key benefits for you then choose Lazarus over Delphi. Lazarus is highly compatible to Delphi and I have converted few applications without much problems. It is possible to maintain code that compiles on both. I don't have that much new to add but I thought I'd relate my crossplatform experience. As far as putting together a cross platform application sketch fairly quickly I find Lazarus to work very nicely. I've recently been using MonoDevelop of which there is much to commend but the gui designer stetic doesn't seem as complete as the Lazarus GUI designer. Or is it the toolkit (GTK#) that seems to lack some bits? Before that I've used Qt / C++ which also seemed to work out fairly well for crossplatform development but I'm not real keen on C++ and Qt's signal/slot framework is a bit curious but works well once you get your head wrapped around it. In sum I find RAD work and coding using Lazarus to be mostly joyful besides what a cool name for an IDE! Cheers

120,Python IDE for teaching? ,I am a student in a year 11 Computer Science class. Previously having taught only Visual Basic my teacher is looking for a language and IDE to teach the class with that is cross-platform and is easy to learn so I suggested Python to him for the language. However he would also like to teach with an IDE with it that includes a form builder in addition to the typical functions of an IDE (editor project management code completion debugging etc.). Having only ever developed with a text editor (usually ) and a relevant compiler I know next to nothing about IDEs and what would be good to use. I've also realised that Python has bindings for a multitude of graphical toolkits of which one is probably chosen for use 'behind-the-scenes' in each IDE's form builder so that is certainly another thing to consider. Could anyone suggest a free open source IDE for Python that would fit my class' needs and would be able to run on Windows Mac OS X and Linux-based operating systems at least? For those who recommend that plain console programming is the best start for beginners I agree! If I were the teacher I'd direct my students straight over to the Python console that is already installed on the computers and start teaching some programming not tainted by the issues of GUI programming. However I would still like to find an IDE for him in case he says that he has to follow the curriculum strictly and needs to teach GUI programming with an IDE/form builder.PyDev is a Python IDE for Eclipse  which may be used in Python Jython  and IronPython development.emacskate - linuxeclipse

144,VHDL language IDE ,  can anybody tell me IDE where i can write VHDL codes? both have IDES available for free download. At least as of a few years ago when I was using it regularly the Xilinx software didn't handle updates well at all -- to the point that if you decide to use it I'd recommend installing it in a virtual machine and if you ever decide to update it do a clean install into a fresh VM image. Your simulator software should have a primitive ID. Xilinx Altera Cadence ModelSim all have primitive VHDL and Verilog IDEs. Actually most HDL developers I've worked with don't use the IDEs except for non-HDL related tasks like top-level schematic capture routing and analysis.  On the teams I've worked on Notepadd++ was popular as well as Vi and Emacs.  I never had a license for it but one partner company used Visual SlickEdit for all of its editing.  It seemed like a nice tool. We used Cadence when I was doing my EE undergrad. No complaints (which is rare for university-provided software).

157,objective c - Apple iOS IDE for linux? ,"I am interested in getting to know whether there is an IDE to develop for Apple iOS? I am currently learning Objective-C but I don't have a Macbook or something like that. So actually I am looking for an ""all around"" IDE including: What else would I need to develop iPhone apps on Ubuntu (if that's possible)? Thank you for any suggestions.What you are asking for is neigh impossible. The only solution I could think of to develop on Linux would be to use GCC or Clang to compile Objective-C. There are no Apple Frameworks or simulators save GnuStep and that isn't 100% compatible. There are a few problems.  The iOS SDK libraries don't exist for Linux.  The simulator does not exist for Linux.  How do you plan to sign your app from Linux? You could technically use a VM but that is against the Mac OS X EULA. Another sketchy option is to compile against GNUStep and test on a jailbroken device.  Honestly your best bet is to break the bank and get a Mac (Mini or Air now that the MacBook is discontinued. That said you might consider spending a bit more on a larger screen. It's really hard to write code on just 11 inches of screen.) A few moths of developing may make back your initial investment.  Good luck! While probably not producing native looking apps there are a couple cross-platform multimedia  tool-stacks like the  for info on this. Basically running a virtual machine with an OSX image is likely to be the best approach if you'd like to distribute your app through the Apple store."
160,php - PHPDoc type hinting for array of objects? ,"So in PHPDoc one can specify  doesn't seem to be valid for example. The best you can do is say I do that a lot in Zend Studio. Don't know about other editors but it ought to work. In the PhpStorm IDE from JetBrains you can use  is not necessary. . I prefer to read and write clean code - as outlined in ""Clean Code"" by Robert C. Martin.When following his credo you should not require the developer (as user of your API) to know the (internal) structure of your array.  The API user may ask: Is that an array with one dimension only? Are the objects spread around on all levels of a multi dimensional array? How many nested loops (foreach etc.) do i need to access all objects? What type of objects are ""stored"" in that array? As you outlined you want to use that array (which contains objects) as a one dimensional array.  As outlined by Nishi you can use: for that.  But again: be aware - this is not a standard docblock notation. This notation was introduced by some IDE producers.  Okay okay as a developer you know that ""[]"" is tied to an array in PHP. But what do a ""something[]"" mean in normal PHP context? ""[]"" means: create new element within ""something"". The new element could be everything. But what you want to express is: array of objects with the same type and it´s exact type. As you can see the IDE producer introduces a new context. A new context you had to learn. A new context other PHP developers had to learn (to understand your docblocks). Bad style (!). Because your array do have one dimension you maybe want to call that ""array of objects"" a ""list"". Be aware that ""list"" has a very special meaning in other programming languages. It would be mutch better to call it ""collection"" for example. Remember: you use a programming language that enables you all options of OOP.Use a class instead of an array and make your class traversable like an array. E.g.: Or if you want to store the internal objects on different levels within an multi dimensional array/object structure: This solution replaces your array by an object of type ""orderCollection"" but do not enable code completion within your IDE so far. Okay. Next step: Implement the methods that are introduced by the interface with docblocks - particular:  Do not forget to use type hinting for: This solution stops introducing a lot of: all over your code files (e.g. within loops) as Zahymaka confirmed with her/his answer. Your API user is not forced to introduce that docblocks to have code completion. To have @return on only one place reduces the redundancy (@var) as mutch as possible. Sprinkle ""docBlocks with @var"" would make your code worst readable. Finaly you are done. Looks hard to achive? Looks like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Not realy since you are familiar with that interfaces and with clean code. Remember: your source code is written once / read many. If code completion of your IDE do not work with this approach switch to a better one (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA PhpStorm Netbeans) or file a feature request on the issue tracker of your IDE producer. Thanks to Christian Weiss (from Germany) for being my trainer and for teaching me such a great stuff. PS: Meet me and him on XING.  Now usage of classes: Once again: I suspect not all IDE support it but PhpStorm does. Try yours post in comment the results! I know I'm late to the party but I've been working on this problem recently.  I hope someone sees this because the accepted answer although correct is > the best way you can do this.  Not in PHPStorm at least I haven't tested NetBeans though. The best way involves extending the ArrayIterator class rather than using native array types.  This allows you to type hint at a class-level rather than at an instance-level meaning you only have to PHPDoc once not throughout your code (which is not only messy and violates DRY but can also be problematic when it comes to refactoring - PHPStorm has a habit of missing PHPDoc when refactoring) See code below: The key here is the PHPDoc  to signify ""an array of Foo's"" but it's not supported by IDE's. I've found something which is working it can save lives !"
161,macos - Good C IDE for Mac? ,"I've just started a job where I'm programming in C on a Mac which is my first experience using a Mac for development. For now I'm using Xcode as my editor then using make/gcc/svn at the command line for compiling and source control. Is there a good full featured IDE out there for Macs that will compile C code (something comparable to VS would be ideal) or should I stick with these low level tools? EDIT: so I called Xcode a ""low level tool"" because I was under the impression that it was just a text editor for code like gvim. I will definitely look into it's compiling/source control features.You can also try  Xcode can manage project and compile for you as any IDE. But if you're familiar with CLI I would recommand you to use a good editor and your usual build tools. Emacs and vim are available on os x (using xcode just for its editor is not ideal). Many mac dev love the excellent TextMate editor but it is not a free (as in freedom) software. Obviously 'good' is a subjective decision but Xcode 3.2 is certainly up to par with what you can do in VisualStudio (if one considers VS good is another thing of course).   I have a project with 250000+ lines of codes 10 dylibs helpfile all in an SVN (Perforce) etc. and hardly ever go outside Xcode. Xcode has a few peculiar ways to do some things and the debugger is not quite as powerful as the current one in VisualStudio but overall there's hardly anything you can not do from within the IDE (and the options to adjust the shortcuts within the IDE Debugger and Editor to your needs are really awesome).

Autocomplete in HSQL expressions in Hibernate configuration (including class property and DB column names) in Spring configuration and it will show you list of those beans which you can inject into that property.  Very smart autocomplete in Java code: and it shows you ONLY > functions in your project. Did I mention autocomplete and ctrl-clicking in paths to files like &lt;script src="""" &lt;img src="""" etc? Autocomplete in HTML tag attributes. Autocomplete in style attribute of HTML tags both attribute names and values. Autocomplete in class attributes as well.Type &lt;div class=""&lt;CTRL-SPACE&gt; and it will show you list of CSS classes defined in your project. Pick one ctrl-click on it and you will be redirected to where it is defined. Latest version has language injection so you can declare that you custom JSTL tag usually contains JavaScript and it will highlight JavaScript inside it. You can use Find Usages of any Java class or method and it will find where it is used including not only Java classes but Hibernate Spring JSP and other places. Rename Method refactoring renames method not only in Java classes but anywhere including comments (it can not be sure if string in comments is really method name so it will ask). And it will find only your method even if there are methods of another class with same name.Good source control integration (does SVN support changelists?

Intellij is much easier to use with consistent key bindings options available where you look for them etc. Feature-wise it will be tough for intellij to catch up with Eclipse as the latter has much more plugins available that intellij and is easily extensible.

This plugin provides nearly complete vi/vim/gvim emulation while editing files in IDEA.        The following functionality is supported:         some comments about this plugin from  One of the good points in my opinion is the : There's a good introduction to DSM usage and benefits in Lattix' website (a standalone product):. My experiences are based on Community Edition which does data flow analysis fairly well. It has failed (refused to do anything) in few cases when code is very complex. First of all I love intellij.  There are at least a hundred features it has that eclipse lack.  I'm talking magnitudes better in reliability and intelligence that no hyperbole can describe when it comes to refactoring renaming moving and others which have already been mentioned. BUT there is one thing that intellij does not allow which eclipse does.  It does not allow running multiple projects at once under the same vm.   When you have separate projects for the front middle core agents..etc where they all have to interact with each other you can not quickly modify and debug at the same time afaik. The only way I current cope with this is to use ant scripts to deploy and update jars in dependent projects or use maven.  Eclipse allows multiple projects to be debugged under one ide vm instance. "

196,Adding PyMongo to Python IDE ,I am a python newbie - I want to use the pymongo library to access mongoDb using some convenient IDE and after looking through the web i decided to use WING.  Can some one point how to add the pymongo library to the WING ide (or to any other IDE for that matter)? i want to get the auto-completion for commands. ThanksWell you can consider using Sublime text. You can run your python programs straight from your editor. It has autocompletion (suggest a listing for what you might have meant to type in). Though it won't suggest function names as in Netbeans or eclipse. But still its a very elegant editor used by many. Also you can  If you are in windows platform just install the pymongo.exe file and it will install in python directory. Then you will be able to access it in any IDE such PyCharm by typing:   import pymongo
200,Cloud9 IDE and C Programming ,"How can I write a C program in the IDE cloud9? Whenever I start to write its showing errors I even tried to change the file extension to "".C"" but it doesn't work. Does the cloud9 IDE support C programming?Yes Cloud9 does support C and C++ programming Cloud9 has a varying level of support for different programming languages and frameworks. Cloud9's ACE editor currently supports highlighting for about 60 programming languages including C/C++. The list is growing and you can get the full list from the ""View -&gt; Syntax"" menu. The editor has extensive support for JavaScript with error highlighting and code completion. It also has live syntax error checks for CSS CoffeeScript PHP Python JSON and Lua. The run menu supports running Each project is a unix sandbox with the standard tools like bash make gcc vim java SDK or perl installed. The terminal in Cloud9 is a full xterm compatible terminal emulator and you can use this to compile and run your C programs. Cloud9 also has a package manager called  which currently has about 120 packages. These packages include e.g. different versions of python and ruby mono lua or groovy. In case you still need additional tools or libraries you can always download them to your workspace and compile and install them there. As you see it is hard to draw the line of what is actually supported but usually you will have at least syntax highlighting in the editor and running from the console. It claims support on the web page for ""Javascript and Node.js applications as well as HTML CSS PHP Java Ruby and 23 other languages"". Yet it's > to turn you off the idea just stating that (based on my experience) it doesn't seem as good as a substantial number of other solutions. Cloud 9 does support C ( and C++ ) using gcc and g++ gcc --version (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-4) You can use their integrated editor but the run button still acts like it trying to execute Javascript which is the default and seems to be their the target audience. They have a fine C hello world example --  Typically I just maximize the terminal and run vim ( they have 7.2 installed ) and it works just like any passable unix terminal.  They also have gdb installed if you need a debugger. There are comparisons against installed compiler solutions but that isn't what Cloud9 is competing against.  Their own description is Google Docs for code and that seems to pretty fairly accurate.  It certainly isn't all things to all people but it is a pretty amazing service. With Cloud9 I can write code on my Chromebook without having to install a bunch of stuff to almost make Linux run on it.  This would be a good solution for students since it would allow them to work in a computer lab without needing any software installed.  I have found that using github and c9 I can easily switch back and forth between c9 while I am remote and a local setup when I am on a real computer."

209,c# - IDE Support for WinForms ,Hey guys I'm a newbie and I just wanted to know of the people who do Winforms on Visual studio at your place of work do your forms have IDE support. Because for some reason I don't have IDE support on 99% of the windows forms I'm working with. I mean I can not see anything on the design view except for errors is this the usual case in industry????Sorry WinForms is not broken for us (me). Check your code. Sometimes WinForms applications that were developed under Visual Sudio 2003 (or earlier) when upgraded to Visual Studio 2005 (or later) become unstable. Start with a new form and if the IDE (it is called a visual designer) works fine then think about re-creating the old forms from scratch with the newest VS installation. Are you using any 3rd party UI controls? Some have dll's for the design view to work and if you haven't installed the toolkit on your developer machine you might get errors like this.  One possible explanation for having errors on forms is licensing. If your company uses third-party controls on their forms they could cause errors when trying to display the forms on unlicensed machines. Another possible explanation for errors with third-party controls is simply installation. If you don't have the controls installed and referenced properly that could also cause errors. You could try to post some of the errors you have to another Stack Overflow question and perhaps the community could help you solve your errors.  Your question isn't clear! if the Visual Studio Designer not working well then re-install the IDE Or explain more... You should be able to view the forms in the design view. Always unless there is an error in code. In case the project is building you should get the same error (this is a runtime error) that you will generally get when you run the code.

219,python - Ninja-IDE virtualenv not importing ,"I started a new project in the Ninja-IDE and assigned it to a virtualenv folder in the settings. The virtualenv works fine in the terminal but Ninja-IDE doesn't recognize the packages in it and throws an import error. How can I access the packages in the virtualenv in Ninja-IDE? Thanks!One quick answer so that others may find it useful. I had a very similar problem a little while ago and had a lot of trouble finding a quick workable solution anywhere not even google. I somehow figured out that the solution was to simply create a virtualenv folder with the version of numpy I wanted and then pointed the ""virtualenv"" property for NinjaIDE project to that folder. I restarted NinjaIDE and boom instantly worked. To set the virtualenv property for your project via the GUI go to the Project menu: and you should see a variable called ""Virtualenv Folder"". Point that to the folder for your virtualenv and it should work. (May need to restart NinjaIDE.)  This worked for me NinjaIDE version 2.2 under Ubuntu 12.04. Edit by asker: If the above doesn't fix the problem try PyCharm-- it works for me."
222,Difference between a IDE and text editor? ,"What's the true difference between an IDE and text editor with a bunch of plugins? Why should I prefer an IDE over a text editor for development?IDE stands for ""Integrated development environment"" not just a tool where you write the code but you can also compile it and debug it.. text editors in their nature usually don't do that they tend to go for a broader approach..be able to edit all types of files instead of specializing in a particular type or language.. sure you can have plugins specific for a type of file or language that compiles/runs/debugs but since is it done by plugins I guess the ""integrated"" part is of of the table so doesn't make much sense to cal it IDE and as said before because the nature of the text editors the potential for integrated development experience will always be limited In the end you want something that's going to make you the most productive. Whether that's Notepad or Vim or Sublime or something else is up to the user and the tasks required at the time. With that said an IDE does bring some solid benefits for development. Depending on the language and IDE this may include integrated build tools source control management unit testing tools automatic boilerplate generation and class/variable refactoring.  ""IDE"" isn't a very well defined term but in my experience single unit IDEs (as opposed to editor + added plugins) seem to have more powerful debuggers more integration between different tools in the IDE (e.g. easy to debug unit tests use of deep code analysis to feed autocompletion etc).  And of course more things work out of the box w/o having to download and configure plugins yourself and the GUI is often are easier to figure out for new users or novices.  But it's a personal choice and the bottom line is you should try the tools you're considering and choose the one that fits best with your needs. IDE is stands for ""Integrated Developement Environment"" where the programmer can develop efficient projects and it provides drag and drop facility which reduces the stress of a programmer. Editor is one which is related to a specific language where you an write the program and run the program.."
223,javascript - PHP IDE with design view ,I am looking for a PHP IDE to work with that contains a design view like ASP .NET where i can add button tables menus automatically. So is there an IDE like that for PHP? Eclipse for PHP Developers does contain this exact thing - because it's a java desktop client though it is pretty 'clunky' but give it a whirl!  Edit -- Just realised you essentially want a drag and drop interface - You actually want a html editor with drag and drop functionality as PHP itself is just server side scripting there's a bit of a difference between ASP.NET (as it's a framework) and PHP which is an actual scripting language. PHP generally just renders HTML elements - in which case you're actually looking for a drag and drop HTML interface. I'm loathed to say it but the only one I'm aware of that's reliable (ish!) is Dreamweaver. The closest you can get to .NET/VB ide is having an editor with html widgets  also has some mode or add-on for html widgets. Now you need to be aware  > ... real men code their ui by hand. Happy coding my friend cheers.
228,Alternative IDE for Stata ,I am used to R-studio for R which has some features such as guessing what function you are trying to type by pressing There is no full-blown IDE for Stata. The question comes up pretty often at Stata User Group meetings and StataCorp developers always say that they work in text editors. See  -- there's plentiful customization for syntax highlighting in every major text editor but that's as far as you would get I am afraid. HTHStasK P.S. Now that I thought about it a bit more it is possible to send your code from a text editor into Stata. There are some hints to that in the document I linked to and it floated up on Statalist a bunch of times. I just was not paying close enough attention as I simply  whenever I make major changes. P.P.S. (Aug 2016) I use WinEdt and it has a Stata mod that can send do-files to execute in Stata. Still that's no IDE in the sense that you don't see objects variables macros etc. You can use Sublime Text to highlight Stata code. I'm not sure how to run code from Sublime in Stata using ctrl+d.  For highlighting follow this: Download:  from: to do this in Linux though). I think this is the closest one can get to an IDE environment for Stata at least for the time being. 
230,Delphi XE6 - IDE File Open button shuts down the IDE ,"Odd behaviour for an IDE choose File Open from the main file menu or press the file Open button on the toolbar and the IDE shuts down. Select ""Exit"" on the File menu to shut down the IDE and it produces the File Open Dialog. It seems unlikely that this is intentional behaviour or have the programmers gone mad? Update: It looks like when XE6 is first opened the buttons behave properly then reverse when a new vcl application is created. The machine is Dell latitude Win7 32 bit laptop. I have installed XE6 on my Win7 64 bit desktop machine and it appears to function correctly.This can be caused by extra files being added to the IDE's Bin folder. In my case it was the FastMM dlls.  I found the answer on the Embarcardero Forums: Per Remy's answer The IDE's copy protection is being invoked at startup. If unauthorized  non-Embarcadero files are placed in the IDE's \bin folder the  actions of the file menu's  Open and Exit items are swapped. You need  to find the offending files in the \bin folder and remove them. The poster there has the issue in XE5 I experienced the issue in Delphi 10.1 Berlin. With probability close to 1 this is due to one of the design time packages that you have installed in your IDE. Remove these packages one by one until the IDE returns to its normal behaviour. At that point you will have identified the faulty package and can dig deeper to understand why it breaks your IDE.   It seems that people other than you are facing the same issue. It is possible that they have installed the same third party components as you that are defective. And of course it is possible that this is in fact a Delphi IDE defect. "

244,3d - Real HLSL IDE/debugger ,Are there any IDE's for developing HLSL code?  The three key features I want are:1) syntax highlighting2) auto-complete3) interaction debugging Visual Studio doesn't do any of these things and it doesn't seem that RenderMonkey or FX Composer do either. Is there some IDE that I'm not aware of or does one of these three IDE's actually support these features and I'm too clueless to figure out how to use them properly?Have you actually tried ATI's RenderMoney or NVidia's FX Composer? Both actually provide syntax highlighting. Futher more NVidia's Cg toolkits actually allows you to enable syntaxhightling in Visual Studio with some custom setting. As for auto-completion I don't think it's much needed as compare to our normal programming. It's because you won't be writing a very long code for your shader programming. Shader is quite critical in that it is run on every frame generated and every instruction require 1 to a few clock cycle to execute thus there's always a physical limit to how long you can afford to write. Interactive debugging is currently the limitation of GPU hardware. To actually do that the GPU has to be emulated with our CPU which is quite impossible considering that the REF (software rendering) device can never cop up with even obsolete GPU what more to say about emulating shader.

259,emacs - Which IDE are CLISP Programmers using? ,I noticed how SLIME (lisp development package for Emacs) does not come with a frame-source-location function for CLISP so you can't automagically jump to a source location when inside the debugger. Given that I figured CLISP users must be using some other IDE (though I guess IDE is a little bit misleading here maybe they're just using a different Emacs package). So what IDE/Emacs package are CLISP programmers using?I think Emacs and SLIME is still what those people use.
262,c++ - C++0x IDE support with g++ ,What IDE has a better support for the new C++0x features in g++?

263,Best IDE for Grails 1.1.X development ,I've been on a frustrating quest to find an IDE which provides reasonable support for Grails 1.1 development. My minimum requirements are: Here's a rundown of my experience so far Using the latest plugins available from the update site Eclipse's support for Groovy/Grails is truly pathetic. It provides little more than code completion and spurious errors As soon as I imported the project NetBeans began scanning it. The Navigator view was waiting for the scanning to finish before showing it's contents. About 20 minutes later both the Navigator view and I were still waiting. Also support for code completion on dynamic finders is poor and for some reason it copied all the plugins into $PROJECT_ROOT/web-app/plugins.  Although the general consensus is that IntelliJ is the best IDE for Groovy/Grails . The root cause of the problem appears to be the change in the location of the plugins folder. IntelliJ is unable to build the app because it can't find classes I'm importing from plugins even though those plugins are listed in application.properties So my question (finally) is whether anyone has found an IDE (not TextMate or Vim) that works with Grails 1.1.X when the plugin folder is in it's default location i.e. under $HOME/.grails/1.1.X/plugins? If so I'd be really grateful for information about: ThanksDonI'm unclear on which version of IntelliJ  IDEA the author of that blog post tested tha didn't work with Grails 1.1.1.   Idea 8.1.2 works very well for me on OSX with Grails 1.1 and 1.1.1.  Grails is installed under /Developer/grails-1.1.1 (with a symlink at /Developer/grails ) and the plugins are in the ~/.grails/1.1.1/plugins directory.    I didn't have to install any extra Idea plugins. What I did have to do was tell it where the plugins were and install the missing ones once I had upgraded to 1.1.1.  IDEA's grails integration can even recognize the plugins from the Grails repository and install them from the IDE. . The Spring Tools Suite is also an excellent choice for grails/groovy development. I use it and do not have any cause for regret. I've been using Netbeans 6.7 for some time and it's very slow the code completion rarely works. Basically I'm using it as an editor and to format my code. I used the EAP version of IDEA 8.1 and it was really nice - very easy to setup and develop in compared to the other IDEs.  Sorry I don't remember exactly how to import an existing project but it was fairly straight forward. If cost is not an issue then IDEA would probably be the best choice. I use STS (SpringSource Toolkit) I like it better than Intellij or Netbeans. I am using 2.3.3.M2

269,php - IDE issue or genuine error? ,My IDE (PHP Designer 8) flags (in red) the above function return line that gets the first value from the database however when I run it there are no errors thrown and it produces the expected results (see below). If I remove the [0] then the flag disappears.  Is this truly a syntax error or an IDE issue?  Looks like an IDE issue. It appears that the IDE does not recognize that results() is returning a list. I've noticed that IDEs will often flag this kind of syntax (when you are offsetting into an anonymous temporary variable). If you want to get rid of the warning try assigning the result to a local variable.

277,Click in OK button inside an Alert (Selenium IDE) ,I need to click the 'Ok' button inside an alert window with a  command. I've tried  but they don't do what I want. It's possible the click the 'Ok' button? If so can someone provide me an example of the Selenium IDE command?Try Selenium 2.0b1. It has different core than the first version. It should support popup dialogs according to : Selenium tries to conceal those dialogs from you (by replacing  window.alert window.confirm and window.prompt) so they won’t stop the  execution of your page. If you’re seeing an alert pop-up it’s  probably because it fired during the page load process which is  usually too early for us to protect the page. It is a known limitation of Selenium RC (and therefore Selenium IDE too) and one of the reasons why Selenium 2 (WebDriver) was developed. If you want to handle  to CANCEL it or  assertAlert ought to do the trick. I see in the docs that alerts generated in a page's OnLoad event handler cannot be scripted this way (and have experienced it myself alas due to the ASP.NET page lifecycle). Could that be what you're running into? For selenium an alert is the one which raised using javascript e.g. There is one basic check to verify whether your alert is actually a javascript alert or just a div-based box for displaying some message. If its a javascript alert you wont be able to see it on screen while running the selenium script. If you are able to see it then you need to get the locator of the ok button of the alert and use selenium.click(locator) to dismiss the alert. Can help you better if you can provide more context: Vamyip Use chooseOkOnNextConfirmation() to dismiss the alert and getAlert() to verify that it has been shown (and optionally grab its text for verification).   Problem with alert boxes (especially sweet-alerts is that they have a  delay and Selenium is pretty much too fast) An Option that worked for me is: The new Selenium IDE (released in 2019) has a much broader API and new documentation.  I believe this is the command you'll want to try:  Described at:  There are other alert-related API calls; just search that page for >
281,PhpStorm very slow and sluggish on netbook optimize IDE for responsiveness? ,"I recently upgraded from PhpStorm 6 to PhpStorm 7. Delighted to see all the improvements but it runs awfully slow on my low-powered netbook. The delay between typing and seeing text appear is often 5-6 seconds and gets worse as line count increases. It is unusable at this stage. How can I improve the general IDE speed and responsiveness?: I made some changes to increase the responsiveness of the IDE. I'm sure there are more things one could do but I found these to improve the performance to well within usable margins. From most effective to least: These changes brought down both the startup time and significantly increased responsiveness of the IDE in general. Add these to your  file at the bottom: Solid speedup to the point that the editor is now actually usable. I will for the life of me just never understand why people create editors in Java. If you need to speed up PhpStorm right away turn on Power Save mode. (File &gt; Power Save Mode or using ""Hector the Inspector"" icon  in the IDE status bar). This mode turns off on-the-fly code inspectionsThis way you can finish what you have started and later decide what code inspections to deactivate.   The most effective way to speed up new phpstorm version is an experimental feature that is going to be shipped by default in phpstorm 2017.1. Until that you can activate it on jetbrains products (webstorm phpstorm etc.)    Click on Add editor.zero.latency.typing=trueClose and open again the application.   For me the change typing is not laggy anymore.Other tricks didn't helped me or not in a noticeable way. Try removing unnecessary files from your project.I had 3k+ *.html log files inside my project and that slowed down typing terribly when the 'Project' tab was open. (Hiding the project tab or turning off the PHP Plugin does also speeds up PHPStorm but obviously those are not viable trade-offs.) (I'm using PHPStorm 2016)"
284,Making Source writable from the Delphi IDE ,"Is it possible to make readonly source code (eg. .pas &amp; .dfm) writable from within the Delphi IDE?  The right click option to make files Readonly/Writable within the IDE doesn't change the properties on the file system.  Is there an IDE extension or similar that can achieve this? A way to do this without having to integrate a source control system would be preferable.  I am using Delphi XE and Delphi 6. Thanks! sseThis is how I would do it. Create a new package which will be installed into the IDE at designtime. If you have an existing package handy then you could carry on using it. Make sure the package  clause. Now add the following unit to your package. When you compile and install this package you will now have a new menu item on the File menu which both clears the read-only flag in the input buffer and makes the file writeable. You can call a .bat file from the tools menu.  So you could write a .bat file to do the work for  you and call it with $EDNAME as the parameter.Your .bat file should see the filename as %1.  Then you'd need a little bit of logic to change the read-only flag (attrib command?) and then see if there is a .dfm and do that one as well. You could also (obviously) make a Delphi command-line app to do this if you're not comfortable with .bat files.   This idea inspired by this article that talks about how to use a .bat file to integrate SVN commands with the Delphi tools menu: Another idea: Just add an option to the tools menu: ""open command prompt here"". It lets you do all sorts of things from the command line such as running the attrib command. Add a new entry to the Tools menu and use these settings: Also make yourself an ""Open Folder Here"" entry:"

Below are few reasons I am looking for alternative IDE compatible for Liferay development. I am sure there are many others too faced same issues which actually makes the development slower. This question is not against the Liferay of course it's a great enterprise level CMS tool. But yes looking for alternate IDE with best compatibility for the purpose. Thanks in advance.You can use  as editor.  Please refere to those links : 1 -  You can use any IDE you want. The only one difference between LiferayIDE and others IDEs is you can avoid using BladeCLI by hands. And nothing can stop you to use another IDE build you project with maven or gradle and then continue to develop. If you are a front-end developer you really should use Gulp and Yo. First time you'll feel yourself confused a bit but after short period of time you'll understand all benefits.

So no niceties such as error checking or code completion there. Is there anything I can do about that? Dreamweaver can be configured to recognize ""new"" filetypes and treat them as editable under preferences.  You can also edit some config files to help DreamWeaver figure out how to treat the files so it does code highlighting etc. though in my experience it does not always work as you would expect.  On the other hand can lesscss be configured to output .css files? Here's an Adobe article on getting Dreamweaver to add new file types. that might be of help Try giving the extension: less.css to your css file.Example: styles.less.css. This worked for me but I still need a base stylesheet such as: styles.css. Also You can compile .less files to .css directly from within Dreamweaver using a free (Donation-ware) plugin:   Dreamweaver has a very hard time with LESS in my experience. It doesn't properly handle nesting and will color those as though they are syntax errors. However it is mostly workable since the auto-complete does at least still work and the overall coloring is okay on everything except nested items. (at least for me) Also the extensions that are referenced above do not work on mac.  If you are having trouble getting DW to be able to open and color code LESS at all try this--  For Mac users there are TWO configuration folders (at least for DW5.5). Two sets of identical files FOUR in total files have to be changed: ~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS5.5/en_US/Configuration/DocumentTypes/MMDocumentTypes.xml~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS5.5/en_US/Configuration/Extensions.txt Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.5/Configuration/DocumentTypes/MMDocumentTypes.xmlAdobe Dreamweaver CS5.5/Configuration/Extensions.txt And this technote tells you what exactly to change in those files:  and for those on mac this little app works GREAT. All it does is watch your less files and automatically save them to css on save. This actually does all that and more as CSS and less have a little different syntax specially when it comes to nesting rules inside one another."
314,eclipse - IDE comment keywords ,So I only recently discovered the TODO comment. For those of you that don't know most modern IDE's will recognize this word in a comment and flag the comment line a different colour so It stands out. EG. You may notice in IDE's like  highlight the TODO comment and some nice other features to do with it. My question is: What other keywords are there like the TODO? It seems like a much better way of communicating to developers through comments and a feature that should be a bit more widely known in IDE's. Their purpose is to help with development after all..I can speak of Eclipse you can customize it. Click on > assigned to the different task tags there too. These are known as  Here you can modify the available list of task tags change their priority and decide if task tags should be case sensitive or not. To add custom TODO tags in  Patterns like TODO FIXME are default in NetBeans as ToDo keywords. You can also add any keyword you want in Tools &gt; Options &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Tasks. for enabling/disabling code formatter use:// @formatter:on// @formatter:off In Eclipse Oxygen 4.7.2 for C/C++ the task tags are configured in Windows -&gt; Preferences -&gt; C/C++ -&gt; Task Tags. You can also enable searching for task tags as @rlegendi answer.

There's also the online help link with links to many tutorials including video ones. Also most of the content of 
321,Selenium IDE and Drupal ,"Can I use Selenium IDE on a Drupal system? I found  but that involves downloading Core and not using my current machine.  Does anybody know of a way to use the IDE with Drupal or if not what do you suggest I do?You can in the same way that you can use selenium on just about any web page.  From what I can see (though I haven’t' used it) the selenium module seems to be more about using Drupal to store and run selenium tests which is useful but will not explicitly test your Drupal site. (>) Drupal comes with it's own testing framework which uses  This is nice because you can then do continuous integration testing by using Drush to script the running of your tests. The question is what do you want to achieve? The Firefox &amp; Selenium IDE (FF extension) combination works great with Drupal for functional testing. It also works great if you want to capture some Drupal configuration settings (that you'd like to play back e.g. in another environment) but there are better ways - Patterns and Strongarm modules - to achieve that. A couple of tips &amp; tricks: while capturing clicks be careful with timings (between clicks) sometimes you need to add ""pause"" lines to your test case for HTML form checkboxes Selenium often records the ""click"" action instead of the much safer ""check"" or ""uncheck"" action (this is important if you run your test case several times against the same page / form) if your page reloads when you click a certain link use ""clickAndWait"" instead of the simple ""click"" action use ""verifyTextPresent"" often especially if you're running your tests ""blindly"" using Selenium RC. I use selenium IDE all the time. It's an awesome tool for productivity and communication.  But Drupal's Simpletest framework has a built in browser for user testing. So you probably won't that module. See:."
326,php - IDE for CodeIgniter framework ,i am going to use codeigniter php framework to develop web application. now i am confused about using IDE. I do not know which IDE is best suitable for codeingiter framework. is there any one who can help me in this regard. thanks.If you want a simple IDE you can go for  just use Google for the others). There is many IDE Editor available in market for development but PHP Storm and Sublime text Editor is best for PHP Development I found netbeans the best IDE for php development so far. It has got nice auto-completion feature debugging utility and most importantly easy to use version controll system to list some. Before I've used Zend Studio for coding but then I've moved to the Netbeans as far as it's the best IDE for me with very useful plug-ins such as svn git etc... and auto code format functionality is very useful to make your code neat and improve the readability of your code.

333,c# - selfhosted WebAPI runs in IDE but not outside of IDE ,"I have a selfhosted WebAPI built into a console app.  When I run it via the VisualStudio IDE everything works fine.  I have a client app that connects and interacts with the WebAPI app just fine.  However if I run my WebAPI app outside of the IDE by just double clicking the EXE my client app is unable to connect to it at all.  I do not get any real useful error information either there are two InnerExceptions in the client (on the PostAsXmlAsync call).  One says ""Unable to connect to remote server"" and the 2nd is ""An error occurred while sending the request"". Normally I'd troubleshoot and debug this myself if it were a consistent error.  But the key element here is if I run this all via the VisualStudio IDE everything works as expected. Can anyone provide some suggestions on what I should be looking at/for?  Thanx!1) If all you are doing is accessing the self host locally you can set the following configuration option: With that you don't have to run the process with elevated privileges (again if you want to access it locally). 2) Another option is to reserve a specific port for the specific user: That also allows you to run self host not as admin as long as the process is started for a user for whom the port has been reserved. 3) Finally the last option is to just run it as admin."

338,IDE for PHP with Visual Designer? ,"Im new to PHP..I commonly see online that many PHP developers like to code php in simple notepad.. however   its always nice to use an IDE which helps the user being more productive by making fewer mistakes and writing good code. My Question is ""WHICH IS THE BEST IDE FOR DEVELOPMENT IN PHP?"" Im looking for a PHP IDE which provides good:- For me its important to have a visual designer in an IDE. Various IDE's dont have this such as Netbeans. Also is there any way to develop PHP applications in Visual Studio? (without/with using VS add-on)First of all I dont like to say ""I prefer Notepad"". It is just a lie and foolishness. Notepad is good for students who want to learn very basic. For an experienced programmer it is wasting of time like saying MSDOS is better than Windows7 . :D In my line of work I have used Eclipse NuSphere phpED Netbeans Dreamveawer PHPDesigner PSPad UltraEdit and Notepad as well. Among them Dreamveawer has the Visual Designer but for PHP I dont like it much. Eclipse Netbeans PHPDesigner and NuSphere phpED are my best choice for PHP coding. I like the code completion feature of them. I suggest you can do the design part with Dreamveawer (DV is best for Visual Designing for me). Then you can use another IDE for PHP Coding. Eclipse &amp; Netbeans are both doing a nice job and are free. :) For designing you can use Dreamweaver etc and then later embedd PHP code  Use -markkoberlein I user .  About your requests: My experience with ide:s is that almost every ide out there is realy good but they allmoust allways lack in som functionality. For instance:PHPEdit is the only ide that has good support for sitedebugging with . I think is a great ide and ther's also a personal lisence for opensource projects d.s. Expression Web 4 isn't the most robust for PHP but it's got the HTML and CSS (visually) down pretty well. Doesn't have the ""Live View"" of DW though. I completely recommend you try PHPStorm. It doesn't have the visual features of DW but it excels in PHP. Debugging is easy to set up. It does language injection (autocompleting HTML in PHP statement for example) which almost no other IDE does. It pretty light on it's feet and is very extensible.  For design view - drag and drop components onto a form - take a look at Embarcadero's HTML5 builder.     Set form and component properties write PHP and JavaScript Events.Forms for visual components and a hidden ""datamodule"" form for database connection query and table components to work out your data logic.     This upgrades and renames their RadPHP product which was principally for building PHP/javascript browser applications - a sort of Visual Studio for the PHP language - and adds development for mobile devices with this upgrade.Lots of features but only shows those relevant to whether you are designing coding or debugging to keep it simple.     Gives easy intuitive and quick results for the novice (like me!) and rapid development for experts. The hype is about mobile but is still an awesome web development tool - and not expensive compared with other editors.  Sorry if this sounds like a sales pitch but the IDE deserves to be better known."

348,terminology - Java Framework IDE ,Hi anybody please tell me the difference between IDE and a FRAMEWORK suppose that am using eclipse (for java) by default which framework am following.IDE Stands for Integrated Development Environment and is a tool that allows you to program in a certain language and usually includes an integrated compiler debugger syntax highlighting and various other tools that allow you to develop applications quicker. E.g. Eclipse IDE Visual Studio Netbeans IDE. A framework is a library or set of classes that makes it easier to implement a certain type of application and is usually deployed with your application. It usually provides a structure that you need to adhere to and various helper classes. E.g. Spring Framework .Net MVC Struts etc. IDE is the development environment the editor where you would normally write code. It also might include a compiler debugger ... A framework is a set of reusable libraries or classes which you could use in your code. Some IDE's (eclipse netbeans) offer a > a framework i.e. you follow its rules enjoy its benefits and suffer its limitations (although a good framework offers extension points to minimise these).  Contrast this with a library which is a collection of code units (e.g. functions classes etc.) from which you draw as necessary but without constraining the structure of your own code. Using a framework is a bigger architectural decision than using a library. A typical enterprise project will use one or more frameworks and several libraries.

355,An alternative IDE for Sybase Powerbuilder ,"Does anyone know of an alternative IDE for Sybase Powerbuilder?  It feels pretty clunky after working with VS2008 and Eclipse. If not has anyone successfully worked with this language outside the IDE? I'm not against using a simple text editor but I find edit-import-regenerate-test-export-edit is clunkier than simply using the Powerbuilder editor. To date the only tools I have had any success with are: EDIT: I added a bounty to draw some wider attention to the question.  It would be a very nice thing to have if it exists. EDIT: Well that was disappointing.  The bounty apparently did not cause even 1 new person to look at the question.None that I'm aware of although you could probably use a source control tool edit in your source control repository and Get Latest Version from the PB IDE to shorten your text editor cycle. Be warned that there are hacks required to edit anything over 128 ASCII. (My guess is that this is to allow everything Unicode to be source controlled in the most restrictive source control tools.) As Paul said PB12 is coming with based on the Visual Studio shell and will include things like collapsible code blocks Intellisense etc.... However for PB12 this will only be used for WPF targets and a few .NET-type targets (like assemblies) last I heard. Win32 targets will continue to use the ""classic"" IDE. Good luck Terry. P.S. Thanks for the PBL Peeper compliment. The PowerBuilder IDE  clunky but I don't think developing completely outside the PowerBuilder IDE is a good idea.  I think there are just too many dependencies right now. However the IDE for PowerBuilder 12 will be built using Microsoft's Visual Studio Isolated Shell so it ought to be much better when that is released.  Also I believe they'll be doing away with the PBL format which ought to make source control much easier to work with. Certainly something to watch. What I do is right-click the object and edit source. Then I copy the text and paste it into Notepad++ to edit. I copy and paste back to PowerBuilder then I can save and see any errors. I've got a fairly decent User Defined Language for PowerScript if anyone's interested. Added:Please be aware that I've seen the PB Source editor corrupt DataWindows. They were all large DataWindows. To be safe always export DataWindows to edit. One tool that will most probably make your PB experience way better is Visual Expert which provides a good source browser. Such a tool should have been integrated into the PB IDE a long time ago IMHO. Only problem is that it's not free as opposed to the other tools you mention. Regarding using external source editors you can probably take advantage of OrcaScript which is a scripting language that lets you perform actions such as export and import of PB objects from outside of the IDE. It will require some effort but you can setup a basic dev env using batch files with ORCA scripts and some additional external tools. However this setup will lack any visual editing capabilities which means no (feasible) GUI or DW work. If you're mostly into NVOs it could work. But then if that's the case why use PB in the first place?... I too have heard PB12's use of VS will be limited to some .NET stuff which will probably benefit only a very small portion of the PB programmers community. I'm afraid the rest of us are stuck with the awful IDE for years to come. Other than exporting the source and editing it I don't know of another IDE for PB. One problem you may have is that the exported source contains a lot of syntax that is not documented in the manuals.  The PB IDE generates this code but there is no support for creating it by hand.  I think you are stuck with the PB IDE In my modest five Years of experiences starting with Powerbuilder 5/6 now using PB 10 I tempt to : ... i came to the conclusion that there will be no chance in improving Powerbuilder to an state-of-the-art language In my philosophy - I obtained during those years - I distinguish between two types of OOP-oriented languages: ...In memory of the good old Unix(Solaris)/C++ days... I was researching a replacement solution that would be similar to PowerBuilder and I came across two that caught my eye. The first was 'React Studio'  . Still researching but I currently have React Studio at the top of our list."

362,Why do we use WebDriver instead of Selenium IDE? ,Why can't we just record all of our test cases in  and run it in WebDriver with Eclipse? I need a clear explanation as I am very much confused in using WebDriver! And can anyone please explain why IDE recorded scripts fail in WebDriver?why cant we just record all of our test cases in IDE export it to java/webdriver and run it in webdriver Great question and here is the answer: Selenium IDE is a Record and Playback tool which is very easy to use but it's very unreliable.  Record and playback is typically a frowned upon in web applications.  Since web applications are frequently changed the IDE is not an ideal solution for a production environment because of the maintenance nightmare that may arise. Let me give you a practical example.  You record your test and you find an element with a dynamic ID.  Sure we can import it into eclipse but what happens when that test starts failing down the road? why not simply make your test agile and independent to catch these in the first place. It also boils down to your principles of test automation.  Test automation in MY opinion (and several other professionals) believe that test automation should be approached from a programming perspective.  Programmers should write the tests and maintain the tests.  Ideally your quality assurance personnel should be trained to write and maintain their own tests. So again back to your question the IDE is designed to be a quick solution to automation NOT a solution to a full regression suite.   And can anyone please explain why IDE recorded scripts fail in Webdriver? I haven't used the IDE in a while but the reason they fail is because the scripts that are exported are simply the  not an entire java file.  This also is because Selenium IDE exportations are supposed to be agnostic when it comes to how to run your test.  Say I'm a user of jUnit.. what if Selenium IDE exported it to TestNG all the time?  That wouldn't be fair.. honestly i'd rather create my own tests than changing that one line every single time i create my test file. You may read the full text of a research conducted called Why do Record/Replay Testsof Web Applications Break?For a Maven integration of flow controls command/aliases/macros used by Selenium IDE and Maven's SureFire test plugin see: for some examples. We've also used our selenium test cases for load testing with Soasta - WebDriver allows simple IDE tests to be used in many different contexts. Because when the complexity of your code will increase it will be difficult for you to manage it using IDE. Maintenance of your scripts will be difficult using IDE. Also Exporting test cases from IDE to webdriver is not 100% reliable. Other people have said a lot of helpful answers. One thing that is missing is that if you write code instead of using the IDE you have the power to make changes to the database. It depends on the website you are testing how useful this is but here are some useful examples I've experienced. In one case the website had multiple sections of a class. One of our tests was merging these sections into one. The IDE couldn't do this. But with webdriver we can add all of our test data into the database perform the merge and then remove the data from the database.  Another advantage that webdriver has is Selenium Grid. With Grid you can run your tests in parallel and on multiple browsers. This makes your testing run faster and you can more thoroughly test the code. 
372,What is a best IDE for oracle? ,"I Work on a ORACLE 8.0.I know how to run oracle SQL command's in SQLPLUS.I searched to find a IDE such as SQL Server Management Studio but couldn't find it.  what is best IDE for ORACLE?thanks ""Best"" is a matter of opinion - available environments include: Wow.  Oracle 8.0 has been obsolete for almost 15 years.  That's an ancient version of the database.  Are you sure you're really using something that old?  That definitely complicates things because it means that any vaguely recent version of the Oracle client won't be able to connect to the database so you're eliminating the vast majority of tools. If you're really stuck with an ancient version of Oracle the old Java based Enterprise Manager application that shipped as a part of the Oracle client is the closest thing to SQL Server Management Studio.  I don't know if that was available way back in Oracle 8.0 but the version that shipped with the 8.1.7 Oracle client should connect to an Oracle 8.0 database.  Of course Oracle no longer makes either the 8.0 or 8.1.7 Oracle client available for download and you'd need to have a pretty old version of the operating system to be able to install something that old.  If you still have a support agreement (though that seems unlikely since you haven't upgraded Oracle in my working lifetime) you might be able to open a support request and get Oracle to send you a CD for desupported versions of the database or client."
373,Why use an IDE? ,"This may be too opinionated but what I'm trying to understand why some companies mandate the use of an IDE. In college all I used was vim although on occasion I used netbeans for use with Java. Netbeans was nice because it did code completion and had some nice templates for configuration of some the stranger services I tried.  Now that my friends are working at big companies they are telling me that they are required to use eclipse or visual studio but no one can seem to give a good reason why. Can someone explain to me why companies force their developers into restricted development environments?If you're good at using vim and know everything there is to know about it then there is no reason to switch to an IDE. That said many IDEs will have lots of useful features that come standard. Maintaining an install of Eclipse is a lot easier than maintaining an install of Vim with plugins X Y and Z in order to simulate the same capabilities. And the most important of all... I love vim and will use it for simple things or when I want to run a macro or am stuck with C code. But for more complicated tasks I'll fire up Eclipse/Visual Studio/Wing. I've written code in lots of different IDEs and occasionally in notepad.  You may totally love notepad but at some point using notepad is industrial sabatoge kind of like hiring a gardener who shows up with a spoon instead of a shovel and a thimble instead of a bucket.  (But who knows maybe the most beautiful garden can be made with a spoon and a thimble but it sure isn't going to be fast) Some IDE's have team and management features.  For example in Visual Studio there is a screen that finds all the TODO: lines in source code. This allows for a different workflow that may or may not exist in other IDEs.  Ditto for source control integration static code analysis etc. Big organizations are slow to change. Not really a programming related problem. Because companies standardize on tools as well as platforms--if your choice of tools is in conflict with their standards then you can either object silently use your tool or use the required tool.   All three are valid; provided your alternative doesn't cause other team-members issues and provided that you have a valid argument to make (not just whining). For example: I develop in Visual Studio 2008 as required by work but use VS2010 whenever possible.  Solutions/Projects saved in 2010 can't be opened in 2008 without some manual finagling--so I can't use the tool of my choice because it would cause friction for other developers.  We also are required to produce code according to documented standards which are enforced by Resharper and StyleCop--if I switched to a different IDE I would have more difficulty in ensuring the code I produced was up to our standards.  Sufficiently bad developers are greatly assisted by the adoption of an appropriately-configured IDE.  It takes a lot of extra time to help each snowflake through his own custom development environment; if somebody doesn't have the chops to maintain their own dev environment independently it gets very expensive to support them. Corporate IT shops are very bad at telling the difference between ""sufficiently bad"" and ""sufficiently good"" developers.  So they just make everybody do the same thing. Disclaimer: I use Eclipse and love it. Theoretically it would decrease the amount of training needed to get an unexperienced developer to deal with the problems of a particular IDE if all the team uses that one tool. Anyway most of the top companies don't force developers to use some specific IDE for now... I agree with this last way of thinking: You don't need your team to master one particular tool having team knowledge in many will improve your likelyhood to know better ways to solve a particular roblems. For me I use Visual Studio with ReSharper.  I cannot be nearly as productive (in .Net) without it.  At least nobody has ever shown me a way to be more productive... Vim that is great.  You can run Vim inside of Visual Studio + R# and get all the niceties that the IDE provides like code navigation code completion and refactoring. Same reason we use a hammer to nail things instead of rocks.  It's a better tool. Now if you are asking why you are forced to use a specific IDE over another well that's a different topic. A place that uses .NET will use Visual Studio 99% of the time at least that's what I've seen.  And I haven't found anything out there that is better than Visual Studio for writing .NET applications. There is much more than code completion into an IDE: etc Nothing to do with incompetence from the programmers. Anybody would be A LOT less productive using vim for developing a big Java EE application. How big were you projects at college? A couple of classes in a couple of files? Or rather a couple of hundreds of classes in a couple of hundreds of files? Today I had the ""honor"" of looking at a file in a rather large project where the programmer opted to use vi (yes vi not vim) and a handcrafted commandline compiler call (no ). The file contained on function spanning about 900 lines with a series of if-else-if-else-constructs (because that way you have all your code in one place!!!!!!). Macho-Programmer at his finest. OK there are very good reasons for enforcing a particular toolset within a production environment: Companies want to standardize everything so that if an employee leaves they can replace that person with minimal effort. Commercial IDEs provide a complex enough environment to support a single interface for a variety of development needs and supporting varying levels of code access. For instance the same file-set could be used by the developer by non-programmers (graphics designers etc.) and document writers.  Combine this with integrated version control and code management without the need of someone learning a particular version control system all of a sudden IDEs start to look nicer and nicer. It also streamlines maintenance of build systems in a multi-homed environment. IDEs are easier to give tutorials to via phone or video and probably come with those. etc. etc. and so forth. The business decision making behind enforcing a standardized environment goes beyond the preference of a single programmer or for that matter perhaps the understanding of the programming team.   Using an IDE helps an employee to work with huge projects with minimal training. Learn a few key combos - and you will comfortably work with multi-thousand-file project in Eclipse IDE handles most of the work for you under the hood. Just imagine how many years of learning it takes to feel comfortable developing such projects in Vim. Besides with an IDE it is easy to support common coding standards across the entire team: just set a couple of options and an IDE will force you to write code in a standardized way. Plus IDE gives a few added bonuses like refactoring tools (especially good in Eclipse) integrated debugging (especially good in Visual Studio) intellisense integrated unit tests integrated version control system etc. The advantages and disadvantages of using an IDE also greatly depends on the development platform. Some platforms are geared towards the use of IDEs others are not. As a rule of thumb you should use IDE for Java and .Net development (unless you're extremely advanced); you should not use IDE for ruby python perl LISP etc development (unless you're extremely new to these languages and associated frameworks). Features like these aren't available in vim: Those are the reasons I choose IntelliJ.  I could go back to sticks and bones but I'd be a lot less productive. As said before the question about using an IDE is basicaly productivity. However there is some questions that should be considered by the company when choosing a specific IDE. that includes: Of course there is a lot more. However I think that this short list help you to see that there is some decisions that are not so easy to take when we are talking about money and some greater companies. And if you start using your own IDE think what mess will be when another developer start doing maintenance into your code. How do you think will the application be signed at the version manager ? Now think about a company with 30+ developers each using its own IDE (each with its own configuration files version and all that stuff)...  Real programmers use the best tools available to get the job done.  Some companies have licenses for tools but there's nothing saying you can't license/use another IDE and then just have the other IDE open to copy/paste what you've done in your local IDE. The question is a bit open-ended perhaps you can make it community wiki... As you point out the IDE can be useful or even a must have for some operations like refactoring or even project exploring: I use Eclipse at my work on Java projects and I find very useful to get a list of all occurrences of the usage of a public method or a class in a project. Likely I appreciate to be able to rename it from where it is defined and having all these occurrences automatically updated.The fact I have the JavaDoc displayed when hovering over a name is very nice too. Like autocompletion jump to a class name etc.And of course debugging facilities... Now usage of Eclipse isn't mandatory in our shop! Some years ago some people used the Delphi IDE (forgot its name) I tried NetBeans etc. But I think we > standardized on Eclipse but it was a natural evolution rather than a company policy. And we often just open files in a text editor when we need a quick update..."

And now I'm interested to know whether it's possible to develop an IDE for this language as an eclipse plugin. Is there any tool for developing eclise-based IDEs compliant with ANTLR grammars?Take a look at  which is a framework for developing language tools (including IDEs).There are plenty of SO questions about it and how it relates to/uses ANTLR. For example:

392,Is there a *very* lightweight IDE for .net? ,Does anyone know of a good lightweight IDE for .net? Often times I open VS and create a new project just to see if a line compiles to test a quick method or something trivial like that.  Essentially what I want is an app similar to notepad I can open have the basic class structure already defined and be able to compile/run it. It would be fine if it was always a console app. Check out  is pretty good. Here's the description from the home page: QuickSharp is a streamlined integrated  development environment for  Microsoft's .NET platform; it provides  a simple uncluttered development  approach that lets you get programming  in an instant. QuickSharp doesn't use  solutions or projects programs and  libraries are developed as individual  files making development a breeze.  With QuickSharp you can work closer to  the .NET Framework development tools  and learn to use the most advanced  development platform for Windows from  the ground up. I would check the

399,Python 3 IDE for teaching ,With Python 3 maturing and slowly gaining adoption we're taking the plunge and adopting it in our introductory programming classes for kids aged 12-18. Is there a > (preferably open source) IDE you'd recommend that supports Python 3 preferably meeting the following criteria in order of necessity:. It's pretty simple imo.12-18 is more like teenager not a kid I'm sure that they fluent with much more complicated interfaces like facebook :) The Python IDLE has most of these features (never used the debugger before so I don't know how good it is). It's probably the most minimalist Python IDE out there. See  I have been hearing a lot of praises about Aptana Studio recently ( made by the coders of PyDev ).Personally using Eclipse + PyDev and really recommend it.  is awesome. Looks good perform nicely and has now a Free Community Edition!
405,smalltalk - alternative IDE for squeak/pharo ,"I've been using smalltalk for a while now and I love the language and the concept. What I just hate is the System browser. This tool doesn't even resemble a modern IDE. How am I supposed to code without tabs outlines and handy shortcuts? I often find myself implementing a selector and noticing that it would be nice to isolate a piece of code in a separate (private) selector just for readability shake but I don't. Because it takes like 5 mouse clicks and I have to navigate away from the selector I am working at and navigate back to it. Oh wait I can't! Because it has syntax errors because I haven't finished it yet! Kills me. And I don't have a 24 inch display to open 3 browsers. Sorry for a little rant. My question is is there a real IDE (Eclipse Net.Beans VS) for smalltalk? Maybe for some commercial version of smalltalk?Historically the real ""IDE"" is the Smalltalk one and one could claim that the others are just an adaptation to the limits of traditional textual programming languages (not rethorical just check out the evolution of typical development environment UIs and how they are adding features that exists in Smalltalk from the very beggining like the senders and references in VS). Just a side note: actually more than 2000 open-source projects in the  has an IDE called CodeMonkey for writing Smalltalk applications.  It's not specifically for Squeak and instead uses their own smalltalk implementation but it may be worth looking into.  Unfortunately it's only available in their SVN repository so it's a pain to compile and install."

Downloaded from IDE plugins on   I have tried the following expressions: All throw the same error: Any ideas?Thanks Pete  I have been unable to get flow control IDE plugin to work. At Michael's suggestion I tried the sideflow.js user extension instead. With sideflow.js I have tried the following expressions: All throw the same error: But the following expressions work fine: It seems there is an issue around the == operator...Selenium IDE doesn't provide a way to act on a value (if else) you will need to run WebDriver and use the programming language to provide that functionality.  However in IDE you can stop the test if the values are not equal by using any of the  and IDE will flag the evaluation depending on the result and the test will continue as normal. if you just need to compare two variables then use command verifyExpression storeValue|id=id1|var1 storeValue|id=id2|var2 verifyExpression|${var1}|${var1} if two variables matches then no error will throw if not error will throw. Thank you Note the single quotes around both the variable and the text.  This took me a while also.Not sure however if you need to use the javascript piece how it needs to be formatted. I believe runscript has to be used after each store variable request.  I may be wrong but it seems to me this is what actually triggers the call to the sideflow.js to execute its functions.  I'm inferring this from my own trial and errors attempting to solve my issues.For integers the following code worked for me.  with == it evaulated true and went to the correct label.
417,svn - How to Integrate TortoiseSVN with Eclipse IDE? ,I have always used  instead of Notepad++. I did a checkout to my SVN repository with TortoiseSVN and now I want to import the SVN project (a >) into Eclipse and commit files to SVN repository directly from Eclipse IDE.How can i accomplish this? Thanks for help!You need to install an SVN Plugin. I would recommend Subversive you can find it in the Eclipse Marketplace ( and configure your SVN repository. Now you can make all SVN operations directly from Eclipse and there is no need to use TortoiseSVN anymore. The easiest is to use a SVN plugin for eclipse such as Subclipse - . Once installed you would not have any dependency to TortoiseSVN.  Also note that if you wish to use both Subclipse and TortoiseSVN on the same files on your file system your working copy format version supported by the respective clients must be the same. There is a plugin which allows simple usage of Tortoise SVN (and also Beyond Compare) in Eclipse: The 2 Phase Installation instructions are provided in the Eclipse site which I followed to install Tortoise SVN in my Eclipse Luna.I followed the Phase I - Option 1 and Phase 2 which worked well for me. 
418,Lightweight Java IDE that Maintains Indentation? ,"Whenever I am debugging a java program I have to have the code indented! And I hate to manually indent code one by one (using Tab). I would really like a lightweight Java IDE that automatically indents ALL your code at a push of a button. A good example is ""Ready To Program"" Java IDE but the downside to this IDE is that it is not compatible with JDK 1.5+  Are there any suggestions on such a Java IDE? to properly format/indent your Java code.  It's even got a handy shortcut:  Edit: Oh yeah Netbeans is great but not really lightweight... In the good old days I used to use emacs as an ""IDE"" for Java development.  It has excellent support for code indentation and formatting. Coding Java in NPP must be similar experience to shaving yourself with blunt stone and using vodka instead of aftershave. It may look manly but there's no reason. It's XXI century. Intellij will run on any reasonable PC same with NetBeans and Eclipse. Those features are no-brainer for me along with about hundred of others. Build in debugger with ability to execute any piece of code or checking variable state are also necessary. I know that most of debugger may be replaced with good suite of unit tests however sometimes you just need to check something live. And as we are on topic of unit tests even that is possible to simplify with good IDE. Intellij allows you to navigate between class and test class run single test whole class or suite with simple key stroke generate test method from template etc. If you live from writing code then don't do it to yourself and just buy a license or use open version. Life is to short to work on NPP with plugins. Disclaimer: Vim is okay if you have to reconfigure something on live system in order to save a lot of $$$ c's it'll take time to deploy new version. In any other case using advanced notepad is just stupid. Why? For same reason as coding not on decent hardware but on OLPC.  "
420,java - IDE debugging points and compiler optimization ,While coding in Java When I place a debugging point in an IDE and that particular statement is removed by compiler optimization-like declaring an unused int and placing a debug point on that line- how the IDE will stop at that particular point? I have seen this but I want to understand how is this handled internally in JVM and IDE.

Is there a way to set a function to a delegate through the IDE?no there is not use event if you want to use that feature
425,cross compiling - Multiple IDE project files ,We are currently working in a team where we use both Visual Studio and Code::Blocks is there a way to replicate changes between those project files? So if one adds a file to the project file it will also get adjusted in the project file of the other IDE? Please note: We want our project to work on multiple IDE's platforms and compilers. Thus a general solution is welcome too.I assume you're using a VCS? If so my intuition would be to write a script that syncs up your project files (based on modification date?) and run it as a checkin hook if any of the project files are changed in the commit. . CMake uses it's own syntax (which is fairly complex though still easier than autotools in my opinion) which is used with project file generators which supports make visual studio codeblocks eclipse and possibly others.  It also has a installer generator which can make NSIS installers Mac OS X bundles and debian/red hat packages (and again possibly others) which I find quite useful.

But is there any solution to be able to work with container getting access to libs for IDE without to install IDE in the container itself ?But is there any solution to be able to work with container getting  access to libs for IDE without to install IDE in the container itself  ? The trick is to run your IDE from the container. Your IDE is installed on your host you just run it in the container.  For this to work you need an  container that has: An example of all this with a well known Python IDE instead of vim is discussed here: Warning: this has been validated on Ubuntu 14.04 only.  Why don't you checkout the official image for python? It doesn't provide exactly what you're looking for but it supports a workflow where the container is built the same way as it should be run on your development machine (dependencies listed in the ""requirements.txt"" and downloaded using pip). Hope this helps. You may also try using cloud-based IDEs like eclipse che or cloud9. It has support for docker and runs in a browser.

448,e commerce - JetBrains IDE with Demandware ,I was wondering if anyone has used Demandware with any of JetBrains IDE. I've always just used text editors and the Terminal. It seems like Demandware UX Studio is only for Eclipse? Any help or suggestions is much appreciated.In theory you can use your editor of choice to edit Demandware ISML files and DW Script files such as Sublime or JetBrains but you would need some kind of WebDAV-Sync solution to automatically upload your files to the server.  You'll also lose debugging when you move away from Eclipse. Editing pipelines will also be quite challenging as you won't have the visual IDE to edit the files (which are basically just XML). Fortunately there has been some movement in the community and a plugin has been created for Jetbrains it is available here: 
456,Is there a reason to have both Eclipse IDE for Java and also Eclipse IDE for Java EE? ,"I've recently downloaded the Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers (for web apps development). Does it make sense to delete my ""regular"" Eclipse IDE for Java developers? I mean is there a feature in the regular IDE which isn't included in the EE IDE?  (I also use eclipse for Python programming with the Pydev plugin). The different ""editions"" of the eclipse IDE are basically just a different set of plugins on top of the basic eclipse platform. So if anything is missing you can alyways install those plugins when you need them. Yes it is a super-set. Also have you tried ? It has better GUI better javadoc support and it is way cooler to use! (and free) Not everyone needs the EE tools (mainly WTP - web tools platform); they may only be doing client apps or writing eclipse plugins."

Thanks for the reply...I really suggest you to use FlashDevelop as your default IDE. This program is a lot lighter than Flash Builder (which is built on Eclipse).

I'd like to test ALL the links on the page to ensure that ALL cause modals to pop up. Each link has a class ""modal"" so I thought I could just change the target value in IDE  but that finds only the first link. I've found a few solutions but they use Selenium RC with Java/Python and those can't be directly translated to the IDE. I understand the IDE is not as powerful but I'm setting this up for a non-programmer to use and up till now it's been really simple for them.i had to read up a lot and i want to thank @ohaal and @aleh for their inputs. i used their suggested links as well as some more external reading to reach the solution like so: i'm not selecting any one answer as all of them contributed to the final solution.

I work for a company who use Savvion as BPM tool to automate some process. It has an Eclipse based IDE. The way it works is that  we can map business process using worksteps and linking those work steps.  My question is how to configure that eclipse based IDE so that it automatically puts some code when ever i tried to create a new workstep in the process. I am learning new things and I do not know where to start. I have gone through the folders where the IDE is installed and all I can find is jar files. could you please guide me as to where to start looking and any tips to get started. Thank you.you can use BPM studio (An Eclipse version savvion provided) where you can build process template as well as customize existing one.
464,java - How does IDE show method parameter names? ,I am writing a java program with an open source library using Eclipse and I am observing my IDE suggestions as follows. I added the library to my project by importing jar from IDE.  As you can see in the image it shows me parameter names as srg0 arg1.. However in the source code of the library in github it uses different variable names such as P N r. I have observed in some cases IDE shows the same name that is used in the source. I am curious on how IDE shows parameter name in such cases. How does the IDE pick parameter names to show here?Either the references class would have had to be compiled using the -parameter compiler flag (see )Or you need to attach the source of the library to the library jar

If possible please suggest me the exact way.If not possible please suggest me a good IDE or text editor like sublime text by which I can easily run C or C++ program. N:B: Don't suggest me of using codeblocks. Take thanks in advance.As mentioned before REPL is a good solution. Another simple workaround is running the program in a new console window.

Sometimes this is related to the fact that the editor does not have access to  where you get the values in the console.  In the case of sublime text you can install SublimeREPL maybe there's something similar for ninja ide.

479,VB6 IDE crashes after application terminates ,"Several developers on my team have this problem. We can run our app in the IDE fine but when we eventually quit the app >. The crash takes the form of  ""Visual Basic has stopped working""  It doesn't matter if we quit our app nicely or force-stop it in the debugger; same result (crashed IDE). The exit sequence for the app is: User selects 'exit' from a menu  Menu event handler calls . We tend to run a group file with a 5-6 projects in it. This error sometimes seems to go away other times it occurs seemingly randomly. I don't know what factor influences this. If we don't actually run the app just the IDE then it works fine and we can quit the IDE itself normally. Anyone seen this before? Any ideas? Thanks!This is most definately caused by leaks of VB6 objects that are involved in subclassing/hooking and not only these. What we did to get rid of these crashes was to instrument all of our classes (including forms user controls designers and anything that can be instantiated) with  debug print statement the call-stack shows you exactly the offenting property of the offending UC. I believe  is correct in its technical assessment of the cause of the problem. But it may also be useful to briefly describe the procedure I used to narrow down the source lines of code. In my case this problem appeared to be TOTALLY random so it was hard to know where to start. My approach was not rocket science - more brute force. Essentially I used a binary search to rule in/out sections of code. First step was to comment out the entire startup procedure so that the app would start as an empty shell; this demonstrated that the problem went away (null result). Following that I recursively commented in roughly half the code testing for the problem each time. Each block was evaluated as a boolean - it either did or did not cause the problem. Then proceed again in the block not ruled out. Eventually (and more quickly than I anticipated) this led to a single line of code which accessed a property of a third-party control."

491,Autoformat Javascript in Netbeans IDE ,Are there any known Plugins or ways to properly autoformat Javascript in Netbeans IDE? After looking into this further I have found that the javascript module is being rewritten already(much needed).  You can finally find formatting options for javascript.  It's available in the netbeans nightly builds.  Good luck all.    You have to use an alternate key for now.  I'm working on modifying the Javascript language in Netbeans to possibly release something better later on(either as a plugin or patch).  I'm still familiarizing myself with the way things are happening in Netbeans.   There have been talks for years to add more formatting options for Javascript in Netbeans.  Nothing has surfaced.  I'm going to propose that the Javascript language leverage JSBeautify(running in Rhino) to provide formatting rather then implementing new features in Java.  This simplifies the formatting process plus the JSBeautify community is very large and it's actively developed.
495,testing - How to loop tests in Selenium IDE? ,"I've been testing in Selenium IDE. It's pretty easy to use and I have created some test cases with it. I've been searching Google trying to find a way to repeat my tests automatically. I've seen a solution with gotolabel while loops etc. But I couldn't make any of them works. Can someone give me a tip on how to loop my test  times or loop forever. I appreciate any help. Do this: The js file provides goto gotoIf and while loop functionality in Selenium IDE. The example below shows a simple loop:   as stated in the answer above install the user extension which will add loop functionality to Selenium IDE tests. The example below shows a simple loop: I'm new to Selenium (just started using it a few minutes ago). After a quick Google search for ""selenium loop"" this stackoverflow.com question came up. I immediately jumped into the extension and started using loops. The accepted answer is very helpful. However I wanted to point out something else for others that are new to selenium (and stumble on this page). I created a simple test for a simple web page. I added a loop so that the test would run indefinitely (until I paused/stopped it). However I noticed that by doing this the Runs/Failures counters within the Selenium GUI do not increment with each loop (I am guessing because a single test case was never running to completion it was just looping indefinitely). So I dug a bit further. My goal was to leave the same test running for a long time (a few hours or possibly overnight) to see if there were any failures (I'm chasing an intermittent bug at the moment). The simplest way (for me after a few minutes of searching/experimenting) was to do the following (likely no plugins needed although the attached plugin is definitely helpful if you want to run a few small loops within a test case): Now I have the same simple test suite running many times and the Runs/Failures counters are incrementing as expected (without the need for any loops). Use the . After restarting Firefox use the  command to jump there. For example: There are other commands that you can see on the plug-in page and documented in the To loop forever just replace  with an extremely large number that will take centuries to execute which probably is as good as forever if you are running Selenium IDE. Selenium IDE now has flow control. These Control Flow commands work by specifying opening and closing commands to denote a set (or block) of commands.  Here are each of the available control flow commands accompanied by their companion and/or closing commands. if else if else endtimes enddo repeat ifwhile end You can read more about it here:  This is a sample for sampcop user in order to automate spam complaints using label and goto Label commands: 1st Login on spamcop.net  2nd use Report Spam option 3rd start this script Your test suite file is just an HTML file so just do the following: "
