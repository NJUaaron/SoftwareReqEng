86,scala - Any IDE supporting SBT? ,is any IDE supporting SBT in a proper way (like Maven for example)? Because I've found a lot of tools that > but I haven't found any plugins that give any support of SBT interaction form within IDE. I want to make an IDE-agnostic project based on SBT but also I want to be able to use full spectrum of features that IDE provide and not just use it as an editor and do all the other stuff from console.Does  (and a Scala plugin obviously!) I know this isn't exactly what you're looking for but putting it here as a work-around for working with SBT in eclipse for whoever is interested. SBT generates eclipse config files but after you import it it works fine from within eclipse. You just need to set up the project for the first time outside of Eclipse run SBT to resolve dependencies generate eclipse structure using the eclipse sbt plugin and import into Eclipse. After that you can run the code directly from Eclipse and it works fine. Here're the steps in detail: Create the folder structure as follows:
178,java - Files edited outside the ide ,"If I run a script to edit files outside of the ide I am using will the ide recognize the changes made to the files? More specifically:-IDE: Netbeans 6.8-Version Control: CVS-OS: Windows XPIn general yes. But the form designer of NetBeans considers some parts of the code ""private"" and you shouldn't modify these parts externally. They are identified by comments in the generated code: These parts are in fact generated from an external proprietary .form file and having the source code not aligned with the .form code will mess everything up. Yes it should. Give it a whirl and check it out. Yes with some caveats: If you have those files open edited and unsaved in the IDE at the time then you will need to tell the IDE whether to discard or keep your in-IDE changes. If you have them open and unedited then depending on the IDE you may have to tell it to reload those files (the IDE should warn you that the file has changed since you last opened it). If you move files around and your IDE has some kind of project file (that tells it among other things where all the files are) and you don't update it accordingly you may have problems. Any files that you don't already have open in your IDE should behave as expected and I would consider it a bug if it didn't pick up the changes."
300,Processing 3 IDE is half cyrillic ,Recently I started to find interest in Processing and decided to download the offical Processing 3 IDE from  I already tried to change the configuration language etc. Also I downloaded the IDE to my workplace notebook and on the notebook the IDE was complete in normal english.

This is a solution which has worked for others experiencing this exact issue:
381,python sleep == IDE lock up ,When my script sleeps for 50sec my IDE locks up which is very annoying. I cant switch tabs look through my source type code etc. It happens in pylde and pyscripter i havent tried other IDEs. What can i do to fix this? i'm actually doing  hoping the IDE will update once per second but it doesnt look that way. What can i do to fix this?I'm assuming you are running your code from within the IDE? Your IDE is probably blocking while running your code. Look for a setting of some sort which might control that behaviour otherwise I think your only choice would be to change IDE. (Or run your code from outside the IDE) Can you configure to run your script externally? I don't know about the specific IDEs but I would try to spawn a different process for the debugged script and not run them under the IDE. If that doesn't help then it is a problem of the IDEs. The problem is your IDE not python. I don't use sleep that often I've just tried it on the  IDE uses the background thread approach and it does not have this problem.
426,php - IDE with specific features ,I'm looking for an IDE that has the following features: The last two are optional but the first three I really need. Any suggestions? IDE has this features (and much more).

440,eclipse - Error in scala IDE ,I not really understand what this error means? This is occur when I delete some source file. Is there any good IDE for scala development beside eclipse? If you delete a file sometimes the IDE doesn't catch that it needs to recompile and so it gets confused about what happened to the file.   To fix go to  and clean the project.  This will force it to inspect the files and recompile.
465,Is there a C++ IDE which handles templates well? ,Every IDE I've tried fails to provide code-completion when something template-related is used.For example  Is there IDE that can provide code completion in this case?Actually this is a fairly simple template use-case ) handles this pretty well. Netbeans sometimes gets it right but not always. It's non-deterministic: seemingly similar code may get parsed or not depending on the whim of the IDE.
468,c++ - Input redirect using IDE (Windows) ,How do I use Input Redirect using an IDE (Windows)?
