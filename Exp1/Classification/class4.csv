4,Rename package in Android Studio ,"How do you rename packages in the new IDE Android Studio based on IntelliJ IDEA? Is there an automatic refactoring included?  I want to make bulk refactoring but I don't know how. I worked two years with Eclipse and in Eclipse it's a one-click operation.For example if you want to change  attribute in your manifest. Clean and Rebuild.  (which is now independent of the package name) can be done very easily in one step. You don't have to touch AndroidManifest.Instead do the following:  Note this will > change the package name. The decoupling of Package Name and Application ID is explained here: The approach used by me for renaming the package name is simple as follows:- : Select the Project option from left menu of Android Studio  : Right click on java and add a new package and set the desired package name  : Enter you new packagename  :Copy all the files from your old package and paste in the new package  :Rename the package name in manifest file  :Rename the package name in build.gradle file  :Then right click the old package and delete it with all its data and delete that directory as well  :Then Rebuild your project  :Then you will find some errors of old import packagename in your project :Then a popup appears like below and select All files option from it  :Rebuild your project again bingo your project packagename has been changed :) Place your cursor in the package name like shown below. Don't select it just place it.  Then press  you will get a popup window as shown below select.(Note since my cursor is on ""something"" only something is renamed.) That's it done. Right-click on the package at the  If your package name is more than two dot separated say  you might DO the following steps to refactoring your package name(s) in Android Studio or IntelliJ: then refactor them by moving them to com and com.hello respectively.   You will see com and com.hello sitting there at the Project(   or  for shortcut) and rename directories refactoring is   waiting there as you expected. Refactor to rename one or more of these directories to reach your aim. The only thing you should notice here is you must choose the directories rather than Packages when a dialog ask you. If you've got lots of classes in your project it will take you a while to wait for its auto-scan-and-rename. Besides you need to rename the package name inside the AndroidManifest.xml manually I guess such that other names in this file can benefit the prefix.  and then insert the desired package name. 2- Open  to the desired package  name. Select option  Uncheck the Compact Empty Middle Packages option. Renaming directory crl to crl1 Finally click on Do Refactor button marked in image belowenter code here After Changes done Please try the following steps: *******Finally it’s done ******   Press  has always worked for me.Simply . It should be fine from here. The best way is to write the new package name and drag from the older package name. The second way if you click > then move option then rename the package name it will rename the package name and then rebuild. In Build.gradle you have to do manually if you Refactor then it will not rename in Build.gradle. I recommend to use the  Done!"
8,nullpointerexception - Which @NotNull Java annotation should I use? ,"I'm looking to make my code more readable as well as use tooling like IDE code inspection and/or static code analysis (FindBugs and Sonar) to avoid NullPointerExceptions.  Many of the tools seem incompatible with each others' > > > > >>  > >Since  (whose goal was to standardize .The former comes with JEE. If this is better than  which  might come eventually with JSE or never at all is a matter of debate.I personally prefer . As other packages graduatedfrom  in the past the javax.annotation wouldbe a step in the right direction. I was hoping that they all have basically the same trivial implementationbut a detailed analysis showed that this is not true. First for the similarities: The ). As described in  the impact of runtime annotationsis smaller than one might think but they have the benefitof enabling tools to do runtime checks in addition to thecompile time ones.  Another important difference is > in the code the annotations can be used.There are two different approaches. Some packages use JLS 9.6.4.1 style contexts. The following table gives an overview:  use the contexts defined in JLS 4.11 which is in my opinion the right way to do it. This leaves us with  in this round. To help you to compare further details yourself I list the code of every annotation below.To make comparison easier I removed comments imports and the  annotation.(they all had  except for the classes from the Android package).I reordered the lines and .In and it has a longish implementation. From my experience If you are willing to buy into the Checker Framework just usetheir . These and other helpful Android-specific annotations are available in the : The support library itself has also been annotated with these  annotations so as a user of the support library Android Studio will  already check your code and flag potential problems based on these  annotations. If anyone is just looking for the IntelliJ classes: you can get them from the maven repository with JSR305 and FindBugs are authored by the same person. Both are poorly maintained but are as standard as it gets and are supported by all major IDEs. The good news is that they work well as-is. Here is how to apply @Nonnull to all classes methods and fields by default.See  for details. Just pointing out that the Java Validation API ( framework.Similar to Find-bugs or  is supposed to ship in less than 6 months:-OSimilar to  annotations. For example: If you use the correct  then the annotations  Click the ""police officer"" in the lower right corner of the IntelliJ status bar. And click ""Configure inspections"" in the popup. Next ...   There is another way to do this in Java 8.I am doing 2 things to accomplish what I needed: Example: So my question is do we even need to annotate when using java 8?  Edit: I found out later that some consider a bad practice to use ). The latter is only compatible with Android so it can't be used in non-Android JVM/Java/Kotlin projects. However the JetBrains package works everywhere. So if you develop Java packages that should also work in Android and Kotlin (and be supported by Android Studio and IntelliJ) your best choice is probably the JetBrains package. Maven: Gradle: Doesn't sun have their own now? What's this: the artifact containing the  is applied to item with a primitive type). The annotation processor provides additional assurance during the software development process that the information conveyed by the application of these annotations is accurate including in cases of method inheritance. One of the nice things about IntelliJ is that you don't need to use their annotations. You can write your own or you can use those of whatever other tool you like. You're not even limited to a single type. If you're using two libraries that use different @NotNull annotations you can tell IntelliJ to use both of them. To do this go to ""Configure Inspections"" click on the ""Constant Conditions &amp; Exceptions"" inspection and hit the ""Configure inspections"" button. I use the Nullness Checker wherever I can so I set up IntelliJ to use those annotations but you can make it work with whatever other tool you want. (I have no opinion on the other tools because I've been using IntelliJ's inspections for years and I love them.)"

10,Eclipse IDE for Java - Full Dark Theme ,"Is there any way to completely turn Eclipse to a dark IDE?Here's a  (Which I have changed a little bit) my Eclipse looks like the picture below:Moonrise is the best dark theme I have ever seen for Eclipse!Just follow the steps on the website and Enjoy! : Dark theme works well with Eclipse 4.5 onward with Windows 10.  No more black text on black background  Update June 2014: As mentioned din "" mentions: A new dark window theme has been introduced. This popular community theme demonstrates the power of the underlying Eclipse 4 styling engine..  Plug-ins can contribute extensions to this theme to style their own specific views and editors to match the window theme.  Update April 2013: It seems the solution below don't work well with Eclipse Juno 4.2 and Windows 8 according to  mentions: .  That can be done with the Eclipse Colour Theme plugin () although you get a fine set of dark themes with the default plugin install and may not need to come back to their website for any more. Get the plugin here. .  This plugin gives you a GUI editor for the chrome colour scheme: .  If you want a dark one go ahead and click away until eclipse is dark. Once you are done some GUI surface area will show through the system theme as mentioned at the top of this post.  Rather than using that editor you could install the pre-baked Dark Juno theme instead.  The install is manual.  Start by downloading it from here: .  It has to be copied into your eclipse dropins folder. This lives next to the eclipse executable not in your workspace or someplace like that. In my case the command to do the copy was: You could be running eclipse from any directory though so which eclipse will tell you where it should go.  Restart eclipse and you should find a Dark Juno option under . It is a nice neutral grey with some gradients and is a very good option. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Update December 2012 (20 months later): The blog post ""  It proves that again the concise codes and advanced features could be achieved by contributing or extending with the external form(like library framework).  New language is not necessary just for this kind of purpose. Update July 2012 (15 months later): I have seen one! (Ie a fully dark theme for Eclipse) as reported by "":   If you export your plug-in place it in the “dropins” folder of your Eclipse installation and your styling is available. "" for an example based on gtkrc resource. Original answer: March 2011 Note that a full dark theme will be possible with e4.(see : ""Fresh up your Eclipse with super-awesome color themes!"" Here is a screenshot:You'll find it there:) Insert the custom css in css editor of Chrome Theme. I spend several hours with CSS Spy to find out all the relevant information to make eclipse as black and this file as small as possible. There is also an .epf File for the Chrome Theme plugin preferences you should import.You can get it from my dropbox:   In the end your eclipse will look like this:I've build a win 7 dark theme base on the popular windows 7 'concave 7' theme for eclipse dark juno theme.And I also create a dark theme inspired from the editor color theme 'Zenburn' created by Janni Nurmin Here are photos of this theme: All settings of this theme is available on github: (I use guari and retta and I think that looks real good :)  I hope that it will  help someone :) Darkest Dark is the best dark theme.It also comes with different toolbar icon shapes.

As a result of addressing  a new way to supply JVM options was introduced in IDEA 12: Now it can take VM options from   and system properties  from  setting.  As for the intellij2018 version I am using the following configuration for better performance go to that path ""C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA 12.1.4\bin\idea.exe.vmoptions"" and change size to -Xmx512m hope its will work OSX 10.9 if you dont bother about signed application you might just change It looks like IDEA solves this for you (like everything else).  When loading a large project and letting it thrash it will open a dialog to up the memory settings.

17,Why is debugging better in an IDE? ,"I've been a software developer for over twenty years programming in C Perl SQL Java  PHP JavaScript and recently Python.  I've never had a problem I could not debug using some careful thought and well-placed debugging  statements? Can you suggest resources (tutorials books screencasts) that show the finer techniques of IDE debugging? Sweet answers!  Thanks much to everyone for taking the time.  Very illuminating.  I voted up many and voted none down.   Some notable points:Some examples of some abilities that an IDE debugger will give you over trace messages in code: In summary print statements are (generally) > toolkit at your fingertips. When I first started coding I couldn't understand what the big deal with debuggers was and I thought I could achieve anything with tracing (granted that was on unix and the debugger was GDB).  But once you learn how to properly use a graphical debugger you don't want to go back to print statements. An IDE debugger lets you change thevalues of variables at run-time.  An IDEdebugger lets you see the value ofvariables you didn't know you wantedto see when execution began.  An IDEdebugger lets you see the call stackand examine the state of thefunction passed weird values. (think this function is called fromhundreds of places you don't knowwhere these weird values are comingfrom)  An IDE debugger lets youconditionally break execution at anypoint in code based on a conditionnot a line number. An IDE debugger will let you examine the state of the program in the case of an unhandled exception instead of just crapping out. Here's one thing that you definitely cannot debug with ""print"" statement which is when a customer brings you memory dump and says ""your program crashed can you tell me why?"" I think debugging using print statements is a lost art and very important for every developer to learn.  Once you know how to do that certain classes of bugs become much easier to debug that way than through an IDE.  Programmers who know this technique also have a really good feel of what's useful information to put in a log message (not to mention you'll actually end up reading the log) for non-debugging purposes as well. That said you really should know how to use the step-through debugger since for a different class of bugs it is WAY easier.  I'll leave it up to the other excellent answers already posted to explain why :) Off the top of my head: As alternative to debug in IDE you can try great Google Chrome extension ) is .NET only so you might want an older one (like in the first link) if you want native code debugging (it covers both .NET and native).  I personally feel the answer is as simple as ""A integrated debugger/IDE gives you a wealth of different information quickly without the need for punching in commands. The information tends to be there in front of you without you haven't tell it what to show you. The > in which the information can be retrieved is what makes them better than just command-line debugging or ""printf"" debugging. Advantages of a debugger over a printf () Can set watchpoints. This is one of my favourite ways of finding memory corruptions Can debug a binary that you can't recompile at the moment Can debug a binary that takes a long time to recompile Can change variables on the fly Can call functions on the fly  Doesn't have the problem where debug statemenets are not flushed and hence timing issue can not be debugged acuratly Debuggers help with core dumps print statements dont' This is what I use most on VS.NET debugging windows: In summary it gives me a 360 degree view of the state of my executing code not just a small window.  Never found a book teaching this kind of stuff but then again it seems to be quite simple it's pretty much WYSIWYG.  A debugger can attach to a running process Often easier to debug threaded code from a debugger With an IDE debugger you can see the values of ALL the variables in the current scope (all  the way up the call stack) whenever you halt execution.  Print statements can be great but dumping so much information to the screen at any given place can produce a >. You just need to define some actions that print required state in each breakpoint start the console debugger with . A problem with using print statements is it makes a mess of your code. IE you have a function with 10 parts to it and you know it crashes somewhere but you're not sure where. So you add in 10 extra print statements to pinpoint where the bug is. Once you've found and solved your bug you now have to clean up by removing all of those print statements. Maybe you'll do that. Maybe you'll forget and it'll end up in production and your user's console will be full of debug prints. Wauw do I like this question. I never dared to pose it... It seems that people just have different ways of working.For me what works best is: I've earned my living programming for over 40 years now working at non-trivial technical and scientific applications in C++ and Python daily and I have the personal experience that a debugger doesn't help me a bit. I don't say that's good. I don't say that's bad. I just want to share it. It's not just debugging.  An IDE helps you build better software faster in a lot of ways: I could go on."
19,Tips for using Vim as a Java IDE? ,"I'm addicted to Vim it's now my de facto way of editing text files. Being that it's mainly a text editor and not an IDE has anyone got tricks for me to make it easier when developing Java apps? Some questions I have: Anything else (other than ""Don't do it!"") that I should know about?Some tips: Have fun :-) I've been a Vim user for years.  I'm starting to find myself starting up Eclipse occasionally (using the vi plugin which I have to say has a variety of issues).  The main reason is that Java builds take quite a while...and they are just getting slower and slower with the addition of highly componentized build-frameworks like maven.  So validating your changes tends to take quite a while which for me seems to often lead to stacking up a bunch of compile issues I have to resolve later and filtering through the commit messages takes a while. When I get too big of a queue of compile issues I fire up Eclipse.  It lets me make cake-work of the changes.  It's slow brutal to use and not nearly as nice of an editor as Vim is (I've been using Vim for nearly a decade so it's second nature to me).  I find for precision editing—needing to fix a specific bug needing to refactor some specific bit of logic or something else...I simply can't be as efficient at editing in Eclipse as I can in Vim. Also a tip: This makes ). I have just uploaded  for the development of Java Maven projects. And don't forget to set the highlighting if you haven't already:  EDIT:  Oh an BTW i've tried eclim off and on but the reason I like vim is its lightness.  Executing eclipse even on headless mode is just too much mental lifting for me. EDIT2:  I've been using playframework lately and this will probably work with maven builds too: For compiling you can configure VIM's make to run maven or in mycase run a build script tee that to a file. ""play_compile"" is just a compile script.  It uses SBT so Maven should work just fine here.  Even direct javac will work.  This way you can use VIM""s quickfix buffer (:cnext :clist: cprev etc). For jumping around the classes I use .  Its beautiful. Use it.  Faster than eclipse in jumping around files. For jumping around methods I use tagsearch with exuberant c-tags. Jump into method declarations by using ctrl-].  Go back    usingCtrl-o.  Doesnt work as good as eclipse but it works good enough. I use  is a nice tool for coding with useful snippets (like in TextMate). You can use (or modify) a pre-made package or make your own."
20,Using Emacs as an IDE ,"Currently my workflow with Emacs when I am coding in C or C++ involves three windows.  The largest on the right contains the file I am working with.  The left is split into two the bottom being a shell which I use to type in compile or make commands and the top is often some sort of documentation or README file that I want to consult while I am working.  Now I know there are some pretty expert Emacs users out there and I am curious what other Emacs functionally is useful if the intention is to use it as a complete IDE.  Specifically most IDEs usually fulfill these functions is some form or another: For a few of these it's pretty obvious how Emacs can fit these functions but what about the rest?  Also if a specific language must be focused on I'd say it should be C++.   One user pointed out that I should have been more specific when I said 'what about the rest'.  Mostly I was curious about efficient version control as well as documentation lookup.  For example in SLIME it is fairly easy to do a quick hyperspec lookup on a Lisp function.  Is there a quick way to look up something in C++ STL documentation (if I forgot the exact syntax of  for example)?You'll have to be specific as to what you mean by ""the rest"".  Except for the object inspector (that I""m aware of) emacs does all the above quite easily: Edit: I realize my answer about documentation lookup really pertained to code navigation.  Here's some more to-the-point info:   Google searching will no doubt reveal further examples. As the second link shows looking up functions (and whatever) in other documentation can be done even if not supported out of the box. I have to recommend .  I'm also working on article about using Emacs as Development Environment for many languages - C/C++ Java Perl Lisp/Scheme Erlang etc... For version control there are several things that you can use depending on what version control system you use. But some of the functionality is common to all of them. It is pretty simple to use no need to customize your init file.You just need to start emacs in daemon mode; This will create an emacs server then you can connect it either from terminal or from gui. I'd also recommend to create some aliases to make it easy to call.  This way emacs will fire up even faster than gedit promise. The one possible problem here if you are running emacs daemon from your casual user you probably can't connect emacs server as  .  For compiling your code it's best to use shell-commands. I am working on this project  very useful.  Truly emacs can be made to do anything. In the recent years Clang became an important part of the Emacs C++ support. Atila Neves had a talk on CppCon 2015:. The other thing it has that I find useful are parsers for location messages so that if you have a call stack trace and want to edit at a particular place in the callstack this front-end interface will can do that.  By far this program could use improvement. But then it could also use people working on it to improve it.  Disclaimer: I work on realgud"
23,Can IntelliJ IDEA encapsulate all of the functionality of WebStorm and PHPStorm through plugins? ,"I am in the market for a new IDE but am confused about the overlap between some of Jetbrains' offerings. It looks like IntelliJ IDEA has plugins that allow you to do Node.js and php development.

I am hoping to have a single polyglot IDE for all development.All of the functionality of our lightweight IDEs can be found within IntelliJ IDEA (you need to  Definitely a great question.I've noted this also as a sub question of the choice for versions within IDEa that this link may help to address...  it as well potentially possesses a ground work for looking at your other IDE choices and the options they provide. I'm thinking WebStorm is best for JavaScript and Git repo management meaning the HTML5 CSS Cordova kinds of stacks which is really where (I believe along with others) the future lies and energies should be focused now... but ya it depends on your needs etc. Anyway this tells that story too... intellij idea is the best IDE on market. I supports all the fetures of its lightweight IDEs like webStrom pyCham etc. It even works sama as Android Studio.There are only 2 differences1. Creation (""Open Directory"") used in lighter products2. It consumes a lot of memory processor and specially BATTERIES (as its like a super set of all ides)"
26,IDE for JavaScript development ,What do you suggest for JS development IDE. Is there something similar to VisualStudio IDE so I can run/debug my application in it?A few options: At JetBrains we've just developed lightweight  that includes very smart JavaScript Editor with DOM-based autocompletion and HTML5 API support.It allows you to debug(breakpoints supported) and run your scripts directly from IDE. I think IntellJ's JavaScript support is excellent just like everything else that they do.  Standalone or as a Eclipse plugin. The Pro version has some nice addons like the embedded IE (to the always embedded Firefox) and debugging support for both browsers.I found after hours of testing that Suns  is the best PHP and Python IDE for Windows and Linux. I was surprised that also Javascript support can hold the candle to Aptana. So Netbeans is my recommendation (not only for Javascript). Give it a try its free!  I've found  Eclipse and JSEclipse plugin and of course Firefox + Firebug the ultimate duo. You'll find this development setup satisfactory. Aptana is a great IDE as it will provide intelli-sense for CSS javascript html java etc.  The debugger gives you the choice to run in FF or IE and is a full featured debugger.  The community edition allows you to run a server side javascript as well.  A very solid and feature rich platform for free.

28,macos - What's a good IDE for Python on Mac OS X? ,I'm about to start a new job where the coding practices are heavily centered around TDD and refactoring and whose primary development language is Python.  I come from the Java world and have been a confident user of Eclipse for a good long time.  When not working in Java I use emacs. I'm looking for an IDE for Python that will give me a lot of the capabilities I've grown used to with Eclipse not only for refactoring but in terms of code completion project management SCM integration (currently CVS but likely to switch to git one of these days) et al. What IDE should I use?Have tried many different (Kate Eclipse Scite Vim Komodo): each one have some glitches either limited functions or slow and unresponsive. Final choice after many years: Emacs + ropemacs + flymake. Rope project file open dialog is extremely quick. Rope refactoring and code assist functions are super helpful. Flymake shows syntax mistakes. Emacs is the most configurable editor. I am very happy with this config.  Python related part of config is here: public.halogen-dg.com browser/alex-emacs-settings/configs/cfg_python.el My 2 pennies check out PyCharm It's lightweight and offers Code Completion. Costs money. EDIT:Apparently Chocolat was an interesting option in 2013 but since then many others came up and development stalled. Nowadays I recommend Visual Studio Code + Python Plugin.
29,c++ - What does int argc char *argv[] mean? ,In many C++ IDE's and compilers when it generates the main function for you it looks like this: When I code C++ without an IDE just with a command line compiler I type: without any parameters.

There is TextMate support for this package as well you can follow this link for more info. 
32,Eclipse/Java code completion not working ,"I've downloaded unzipped and setup Eclipse 3.4.2 with some plugins (noteable EPIC Clearcase QuantumDB MisterQ).

If I type  and press Try  in '' An example of the kind of data you see in this preference screen however not necessarily what you currently have. if have duplicate Mylyn entries uncheck the duplicate entries that do not contain ""  Then in the : as suggested by @nhahtdh's comment adding the some more info to answer directly: IBus plugin in Xfce uses by default I faced this problem and spent hours trying to figure out the issue. tried to follow the steps mentioned in the different answers above the solution I found is on the same lines as Mona suggested but slightly different. Tried to add as a comment to Mona's answer but no option was available.Issue with my eclipse was classpath somehow got corrupted and all the jars and dependent projects were missing. after taking the latest .classpath from repository it worked fine. I had this problem and like @Marc only on a particular class.  I discovered that I needed to designate Open With = Java Editor.  As a Eclipse newbie I hadn't even realized that I was just using a plain editor. In the package explorer right-click the file and chose ""Open With"".  I also face this issue but it is resolved in different way.Steps that I follow may be helpful for others. Once you have you configuration checked and completion is still not working: Do you see the right icon beside the file?: response but the add comment only works after I have a rating of 50? not sure WTF that is... ThanksTom For me the issue was a conflict between several versions of the same library. The Eclipse assist was using an older version than maven.  I had to go to the .m2 directory and delete the unwanted lib version + restart eclipse. I experience problems on Eclipse Neon when . When I copy the same file to the project root directory not even to the src directory the completion starts working. When the file is opened from a different directory only completion for JRE works. That is for example:  does not. Just in case anyone got to a desperate point where nothing works... It happened to us that the content assist somehow shrunk so no suggestion was shown just the ""Press Ctrl+Space for non-Java..."" could be seen.So it was just a matter of dragging the corner of the content assist to enlarge the pop-up. I know embarrassing. Hope it helps. Note: this was an Ubuntu server with Xfce4 using Eclipse Oxygen.  eclipse version so I assume the auto-complete feature does not migrated correctly during the upgrade process. The only solution that worked for me was to create a new eclipse workspace and import the project/s to it. It might take a few minutes but it worth it - comparing to the time spent on other solutions... "

35,debugging - IDE and Debugger for node.js ,I am going to start building project in node.js (was working in PHP before) What is the IDE Debugger and Helping Tools for node.js to help improvement while coding ?There are several IDEs which support Node.js natively: WebStorm 3.0 does all this stuff.It auto completes in a smart way includes nice debugging and unit testing. It also include number of inspection for javascript which is also pleasant.Now RC version is available but JetBrains assure that it'll be released soon.  I use IntelliJ's Webstorm:  for it's advance auto-complete features and Node.js/NodeUnit templates.
37,Changing API level Android Studio ,"I want to change the minimum SDK version in Android Studio from API 12 to API 14. I have tried changing it in the manifest file i.e. and rebuilding the project but I still get the Android Studio IDE throwing up some errors. I presume I have to set the min SDK in 'project properties' or something similar so the IDE recognizes the change but I can't find where this is done in Android Studio.When you want to update your minSdkVersion in an existent project... An example of build.gradle: For beginners in Android Studio ""Sync gradle button"" is located in  Tools -&gt; Android -&gt; Sync Project with Gradle Files ""Rebuild project""  Build -&gt; Rebuild Project  Though this question was already answered but Android Studio has changed a little bit by its stable release. So an easy straight forward way will help any new answer seeker landing here. In android studio you can easily press:  You can also change the  For the latest Android Studio v2.3.3 (October 11th 2017) : 1. Click  on menu bar  2. Click Open Module Settings  3. Open  tab  4.

In Android studio open build.gradle and edit the following section: here you can change minSdkVersion from 12 to 14 Changing the minSdkVersion in the manifest is not necessary. If you change it in the gradle build file as seen below you accomplish what you need to do.  For me what worked was: (right click)project-&gt;android tools-&gt;clear lint markers. Although for some reason the Manifest reverted to the old (lower) minimum API level but after I changed it back to the new (higher) API level there was no red error underline and the project now uses the new minimum API level. Edit: Sorry I see you were using Android Studio not Eclipse. But I guess there is a similar 'clear lint markers' in Studio somewhere and it might solve the problem.

40,Best C++ IDE or Editor for Windows ,"What is the best C++ IDE or editor for using on Windows? I use Notepad++ but am missing IntelliSense from Visual Studio.I've found the latest release of NetBeans which includes C/C++ support to be excellent.  a powerful open-source cross platform IDE. It has code completion amongst other features. I will quote myself from this question: Someone already said this before me  but QtCreator is really good for Qt4  development. Not only it has a really good code  completion support. It also knows a  little more about the code and what to  complete then I thought I needed. For  example it knows about slots/signals.  This means that connecting  slots/signals via code is much easier  then before. The code editing is really nice. I  remember that when refactoring code  (a few variables starting with  underscore) it remembered the cursor  position between lines and this made  the refactoring much easier. The code  indentation is smart enough to not get  in my way (KDevelop was configurable  but QtCreator learns how I code. At  least it feels like it does). Then there are the cool key  combinations. Most of the  functionality of the IDE can be  accessed using shortcuts. The  ""control+k"" thingie is a nice thing  which some command line users would  like but I am more GUI oriented. I  don't use it. What I really like is the split  window command. Yes KDevelop3 does  it but not as nice as QtCreator. My  favorite is control+e3 which I use to  display the header and implementations  of my classes. Once again the  navigation here is the best I have  seen (control+eo). It also has a nice SCM integration. I  usually use SVN and quite frankly  it's not as good as I need: no  shortcut to diff the project no diff  to commit the whole project no option  to commit several files. I also don't like the ""total  integration of external tools"". I  still like the external QtAssistant -  control+tab is easier to read large  articles. But.... when you define a  QString s and 3 lines bellow you want  to read the interface of QString you  put your cursor on ""s"" and press F1 -  the assistant comes as a sidebar with  QString's documentation. A huge  advantage. Want to follow a definition? F2 to the  help. F4? Changes  header/implementation (yes eclipse  does this better...). The debugger is good. It's not as good  as VisualStudio but ... it has support  for Qt4 internals (you can see the  value of QString and QList!). I can continue... but IMHO you will  need to give it a second and third  try. It really is a good product. Not  as flexible as Eclipse (hi  ryansstack) but it's a really small  fast and young project. I stopped  developing QDevelop because I really  found what I was looking for. ps: yes I mean stopped developing  QDevelop. I was in the development  team. My response is for Qt4 development only. Be warned. SlickEdit is very cool and does support something like intellisense. At my current company I now use Visual Studio and I've mostly gotten used to it - but there are still some SlickEdit features I miss.  As a complete all-in one package Visual Studio 2008 is the best IDE for C++ development with Windows Visual studio is great but there are few tricks you can enhance it with. SonicFileFinder is one - helps you to search source files by partial match. You can map solution-tree to Alt+1 partial filename search to alt+2 and properties-window to alt+3. These are the three most used windows.  Another great tool that is ofter misunderstood is ctrl+shift+F shortcut for searching file contents. People dont use because it's so slow but my advice is - deal with it. Searching  the whole solution (or even all files in project folder) is only slow the first time you use it. Consequitive searches are as fast as jump-to-definition-feature. I've tried SlickEdit Notepad++ emacs jEdit and Visual Studio. VS wins hands-down for Best Windows IDE.  jEdit is probably the best GUI cross-platform editor/almost-IDE and emacs is probably the best terminal cross-platform editor/almost-IDE. The advantage with using these is that when you jump to a Mac or Linux box you know how they work.  I tried Eclipse but it ran like a no-legged dog it was so slow so I didn't use it much. Maybe tech is better now but eh. With Intellisense code folding edit and continue and a whole host of other features Visual Studio is certainly the best IDE.  However for simple code editing I often use UltraEdit.  It has some great features not found in Visual Studio.  One surprisingly useful feature is being able to select a column in the editor.  You can find and replace within the column (useful for tabs vs. spaces wars...) delete the column etc... How about CodeBlocks i find it so fine with me especially the new 10.05 version. I would recommend . Here's another vote for Visual Studio.  The debugger and Intellisense are definitely it's hallmarks.  While other IDE's offer code-completion I've often found them to be somewhat sluggish in this area for some reason (sluggish being a reference to the speed at which code-completion occurs and offers selections).   Other than VS NetBeans is a good polished IDE and is updated on a very regular cycle. I think it's largely a matter of taste but I would recommend begginers to stick to a pure editor (vi emacs...) instead of a full fledged IDE so they can figure out the whole toolchain that modern IDEs hide. Just for the record my weapon of choice is Emacs. personally i dont like microsoft......I hate to admit that visual studio is the best IDE i ever use.....Netbeans is gud but drasticaly slow....other free IDEs are useless..so people try to stick with VS.... M$ VS2008 is a better IDE for this. The question says specifically IDE so I am guessing thats what you want. In that case the main options are Visual Studio and Eclipse CDT as stated above. Of those I personally prefer Eclipse. However don't necessarily limit yourself to an IDE. I prefer to use vim as my editor and WinDbg as my debugger. For compilation your project will probably dictate this. I currently use NMAke on the command line. Use Visual Studio 2010. You can get the full version free with "
41,emacs - Best Common Lisp IDE ,I've used Slime within Emacs as my primary development environment for Common Lisp (or Aquamacs on OS X) but are there other compelling choices out there? I've heard about Lispworks but is that [or something else] worth looking at? Or does anyone have tips to getting the most out of Emacs (e.g. hooking it up to the hyperspec for easy reference)? Update: Section 7 of Pascal Costanza's . More resources:There are some flashier options out there but I don't think anything's better than  I use Vim the Ion3 window manager and terminal windows and enjoy it very much.
42,Difference between framework vs Library vs IDE vs API vs SDK vs Toolkits? ,I want some examples. I always get confused so with some examples I might be able to figure it out better. Also: Is Eclipse an API or IDE?An : While not the prevalent notion a framework can be viewed as a kit. It also has a library (or a collection of libraries that work together) that provides a specific coding structure &amp; pattern (thus the word >). (e.g. Spring Framework) Consider Android Development: IDE: Eclipse etc.. Library: android.app.Activity library (Class with all code) API: Interface basically all functions with witch we call  SDK: The Android SDK provides you the API libraries and developer tools necessary to build test and debug apps for Android(----tools - DDMSEmulator ----platforms - Android OS versions ----platform tools - ADB ----API docs) ToolKit: Could be ADT Bundle Framework: Big library but more of architecture oriented SDK represents to software development kit and IDE represents to integrated development environment.  The IDE is the software or the program is used to write compile run and debug such as Xcode.  The SDK is the underlying engine of the IDE includes all the platform's libraries an app needs to access. It's more basic than an IDE because it doesn't usually have graphical tools. In other words... Even your notepad is an IDE. Every software you write/compile code with is an IDE.   A bunch of code which simplifies functions/methods for quick use. A programming interface for functions/configuration which you work with its usage is often documented. Extras and/or for development/testing purposes.  Tiny apps for quick use often GUIs.  Apps with a graphical interface requires no knowledge of programming unlike APIs. Bunch of APIs/huge Library/Snippets wrapped in a namespace/or encapsulated from outer scope for compact handling without conflicts with other code. A design pattern separated in Models Views and Controllers for huge applications. They are not dependent on each other and can be changed/improved/replaced without to take care of other code. The object that is being  presented.  Example in IT: A HTML form.  Example in IT: Browser that renders a website with the form.  Example in IT: Functions which handle form data that's being submitted.Small codes of only a few lines may not be even complete but worth for a quick share. Exclusive functions for specified frameworks/APIs/libraries only. Additional modules or services for specific GUIs.
43,Query IDE for MongoDB? ,"I'm wondering if there is an IDE for MongoDB that allows you to run queries and see the results? This would behave like query analyzer in SQL Server Management Studio. The issue I'm having right now is that I have to do queries such as ""db.MyTable.find()"" from command prompt which isn't a good solution.  If the answer is no is there a more mature ""no sql"" solution like MongoDB that does have an IDE? By far the best UI (for Windows) currently out there  is MongoVUE. Robo 3T (formerly Robomongo) give you a shell like interface but outputs your results in the gui.Its available for windows mac(dmg zip) and linux (deb rpm tar.gz) as a desktop application. Currently there is a free community version (no ads all features) and payed ones with more support and influence on backlog. Robo 3T (formerly Robomongo) prints the results in a treeView or Json text representation and supports the generation of UUID (.NET-Python-Java-Encoding). It has autocomplete shows multiple results at once and has a query history. "
48,Inefficient jQuery usage warnings in PHPStorm IDE ,I recently upgraded my version of PHPStorm IDE and it now warns me about inefficient jQuery usage. For example: Prompts this warning: Checks that jQuery selectors are used in an efficient way. It suggests  to split descendant selectors which are prefaced with ID selector and  warns about duplicated selectors which could be cached. So my question is: Why is this inefficient and what is the efficient way to do the above selector? I'd guess at: Is this the right way?I had the same question today and was able to find a solution thanks to  There was some discussion about this on jQuery forums but its 3 years old:As they point out here if you are doing a lot of operations on same id selector the greatest performance improvement is found by caching the top level element.On the other hand if you are doing just a few selections there is going to be virtually no performance difference. Therefor I believe that IntelliJ is overstating the importance of this code style.  The first question is to hit Alt+Enter and select the first tip in the list then hit Enter you'll see what it thinks the most efficient way.
49,Which IDE for Scala 2.8? ," is the same question for older version of Scala but they say that Eclipse plugin has been improved vastly. Is it the best IDE now? How do different Scala IDE compare today? I've been pretty successful with IDEA 9. I've briefly tried both Netbeans and Eclipse and wasn't able to get what I wanted. Eclipse's code-complete didn't behave as well as I'd have liked and I couldn't find a way to make Netbeans handle Scala scripts; It'd just complain that the file wasn't a class. To be clear I've been using IDEA for a few years for Java so keep that in mind:) For the moment Scala Plugin in IntelliJ IDEA is the best. It handles Scala 2.8 well. IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition is now free and open source (and works with Scala) so I can't see any reason for not using it. The plugin is still somewhat buggy (many ""false negatives"" i.e. the code without red underscores may not compile successfully; but almost no ""false positives"") but perfectly usable. The best thing is that you can use IDEA's excellent debugger with Scala (not without some issues but it actually works!). FSC (Fast Scala Compiler) is also supported in latest builds. A huge time-saver. The plugin development team is quite responsive. Some of the guys work directly in JetBrains and possess intimate knowledge about IDEA platform so the development progresses fast. JetBrains IDEA's Scala plug-in handles 2.7 and 2.8 equally well. I cannot make any comparisons because I have used only IDEA. Using Eclipse Helios with the dev-version of the new Scala(2.8) plugin as there isn't an official release yet. That > beta definitively -- but I can't confirm the frequently expressed opinion that this plugin is outright horrible ;-) I'd say the experience is already OK-ish and indeed better than the current state of affairs with the Groovy plugin. OTOH the experience with plain Java is way more smooth (feels like flying at times) and the current CDT I'd rate somewhat in between. Incremental compile and error highlighting work quite well for me; tweaking a DSL implementation into form just by continuously rewriting your code until the error markers are gone -- without ever having to test-run your program -- is outright fun and just again shows that FP / static typing rocks! Problems encountered from time to time:- implicits and nested types in other compilation units (esp. nested / super packages) aren't picked up at times when there are still other errors around; they will be picked up after an full build- there seems to be a memory leak in the version I'm using right now (from end august 2010) necessitating to restart the workbench after some hours of work- beware when you're using AspectJ to make sure you get a version of the Scala plugin which relies on a JDT weaving bundle version which also works with AJDT PS: I'm using maven builds in all my projects and generated the eclipse projects with the eclipse-maven-plugin and then imported them as plain-flat eclipse projects. I can just strongly recommend everyone to keep away from the M2-eclipse plugin (for maven) in its current (2010) state it makes your workbench painfully slow is buggy and has lots of almost unpredictable behaviour because it constantly tries to do magic things behind the scenes (and besides that the aspectj support is broken since this spring) i use both eclipse and IDEA eclipse supports type detection isbetter than IDEA (it is veryneccessery thing if you want programin functional style that you can beaware from type of expressions andvariables.) : IDEA supports type detection like eclipse but you haveto define a value in your functionsfor example: deftestTs[A](a:List[String]b:List[A])= for{      ai &lt;- a      bi &lt;- b    }  yield (aibi)   }deftestTs[A](a:List[String]b:List[A]):List[(StringA)]={    val result = for{      ai &lt;- a      bi &lt;- b    }  yield (aibi)   }I think that the best option so far is the ScalaIDE for Eclipse. You can go to the ScalaIDE Web Site and look around to see by yourself.  to get an idea. For everyone who is really considering doing some serious development with Scala I strongly recommend to evaluate the IDEs in question beyond the basics. When you are into an agile approach which in my option requires a painless refactoring support without surprises (especially in multi-module projects) things are pretty tight at the moment. It would be pretty neat if someone came up with a IDE independent specification-like list of refactorings (and desired outcomes) which could be used to verify an IDE's refactoring support. The officially endorsed and supported (by Typesafe) for Scala 2.9 is Eclipse. The current version is far superior to prior versions and includes a context-aware REPL full-featured debugger and even the ability to debug REPL statements.  I think this question needs to be updated and the answers revisited. I don't recommend the Scala IDE/Eclipse.  It doesn't have a lot of the features that are even available for Eclipse with Java.  And there are bugs. I am using the latest NetBeans and haven't tried anything else. I've met at least 2 notable bugs in NetBeans while coding in Scala: One: NB occasionally come unable to run a program hanging on classpath scanning.Solution: Create a new project copy your code there and go on.Comment:  of particular namespaces or classes and complains when you use them.Solution: Just ignore and go on - compiler founds no errors and the program works. I'd recommend IDEA's plugin for now. The Scala plugin for NetBeans is quite nice too. It doesn't yet support NetBeans 6.9 the newest release though and you still need to download it manually instead of installing it directly from the plugin manager inside NetBeans.  However it integrates better with Maven projects than IDEA's plugin does (this is true for NB and IDEA in general in my opinion). It partly depends on your style of working as all the options have strengths and weaknesses. If you need refactoring across mixed java/scala projects then IntelliJ is your only option. If you want to do any work on the compiler or a compiler plugin then Eclipse has the advantage of being able to launch a runtime workspace with a custom compiler build including breakpoints.  It also improved massively for the 2.8 Scala release. Netbeans is a fine choice to go with if you're already very familiar with that platform the costs of learning a new environment may well outweigh any benefits and all three solutions are improving rapidly. I haven't tried netbeans scala plugin yet but I find that Intellij IDEA plugin is at any way much better a scala ide than the Scala eclipse plugin which is sooooo slow that drives me crazy.Though swing applications don't work well with my tiling window manager. try IDEAX the latest community edition of Intellij IDEA (version 10) it has improved scala plugin which has faster code compilation and exceution in addition to that it has Maven3 and SBT support with which we can develop Lift applications. IntelliJ IDEA community edition + Scala Plugin + SBT plugin"
55,Does Google Chrome work with Selenium IDE (as Firefox does)? ,I can't find an equivalent of Selenium IDE that works with Chrome. Does anyone know the way to use Selenium IDE works with Chrome instead of Firefox? Or is there any alternative tool which can work with Chrome?artejera do you mean Selenium as plugin to your browser (Selenium IDE)?Here is . Katalon Studio is a free Selenium IDE alternative. Our team has used it before and it has some advantages over Selenium IDE: Whatever tool you choose there are some criteria you should pay attention to: you can use Google chrome extensions like imacros scirocco on chrome 21 or later versions. they are similar to selenium IDE for Firefox. Scirocco seems to be new with some limitations like navigation is not supported. So I recommend 'imacros' seems very close to selenium. If you want to harness Selenium IDE record &amp; playback capabilities for Chrome browser there is an equivalent extension for Chrome called Scirocco.You can add it to Chrome by visiting here using your Chrome browser 
57,Professional VHDL IDE? ,Is there a good IDE to work with VHDL projects ?Or are most of the professionals working with emacs/vim/notepad++ ?I use Emacs+VHDL-mode which is great if you don't mind (or have already climbed) the learning curve of Emacs. Alternatively you could try  for simulation. But I am no professional so I suppose they are using some of the former two products. Engineers in large semiconductor companies are using emacs/vim for code editing. Integrated Development Environment doesn't make much sense there since a > is a few thousand HDL files taken from different places on a *NIX network setup scripts for a dozen different tools and cron jobs to do frequent builds. For simpler FPGA projects developed on Windows I've seen people using Borland CodeWright UltraEdit and Crimson Editor.     My best bet is to use VIM to do whatever i need to for VHDL formatting. VIM has an extremely powerful facility to develop custom plugins and no amount of IDE hopping will give you all the customization you would ever need.  Things like signal names &lt; 20 characters procedure lengths &lt; 100 lines no use of linkage ports -- all of these can be coded in VIM with minimal effort. You could actually run vcom or ncvhdl from within VIM and then see where the errors are.  Having said all this you might want to take a look at what Sigasi has to offer. If you need more help on this let me know -- it'd be fun coding a VIM plugin.  Emacs + VHDL mode + a compiler / simulator + source control. The VHDL mode is configured to use the compiler to compile the design and optionally run the simulation. Emacs can link with the source control to correctly check in diff and tag. I personally like this set up because the editor is open source and I can use it anywhere (Mac Linux Windows). The compiler / simulator can be anything from a free download (FPGA vendor sponsored Modelsim or GHDL) to a grid engine. Once set up it pretty much becomes invisible. Simplifide also has an eclipse plugin which supports VHDL Verilog and SystemVerilog which contains all of the standard IDE features and more.  It can be downloaded at . It's a plugin I'm working on that provides syntax checking based on simulators/compilers. I'm using daily with ModelSim and so far works nice. Emacs with the appropriate language mode is my vote. Basic editing is easy enough to learn and there are a lot of example config files out there.Kevin. I'm using Xilinx ISE for educational purposes it works really well. And it has everything. After applying for a student license the student version it free to use but it takes up a lot of space. The installation file alone is more than 6 gb. The book we use for school is referring to xilinx special properties. (“FGPA Prototyping by VHDL Examples”). I'm also programming on a nexsys 3 spartan 6 testboard and I'll be using xilinx for another year but when I finish the course I’m gonna look for something smaller. Happy to read about the lightweight alternatives.

60,Using SBT from Scala IDE ,The path from SBT to Scala-IDE is well described in many places: What is the reverse for this? If I start a new project in Scala-IDE can I just add a build.sbt file and somehow tell Eclipse to use this when running the application? Apologies if this seems obvious to some but I've recently moved from ItelliJ Idea to Scala-IDE and I'm not certain about setting up Scala-IDE to use SBT and my sbt config files.No you cannot do this. The way to do it is as you described. Then whenever you make changes to build.sbt (e.g. new jar dependency) rerun the  command from sbt and refresh the project in Eclipse so that the newly generated files are reloaded. As a seasoned Eclipse user I wondered the same thing. Amazed that no one seemed to be going that direction I decided to roll my own project.  Install plugin create or modify build.sbt and dependencies are fetched project files updated. It works for me I use it every day. But it's not perfect or finished and I'm not putting in a lot of effort in it at the moment. But do feel free to contribute!

67,Is there an online PHP IDE? ,"Is there an IDE for PHP where you can edit the code for your pages online? Real syntax highlighting is minimal. More would be great. I'd like to be able to do development on my site at times other than when I'm at home. even thera are some limits (no Internet nonnections no file manipulations) I have been trying for ages to find a really good online php editor with which a/to learn php and b/convert some old Delphi (!) source files into the 21st century.  After a couple of very disappointing experiences and irritating false starts most notably with phpanywhere (god did I have high hopes on first discovering that one:( ) I eventually stumbled upon ShiftEdit in Chrome webstore. So far I've been able to everything I need and as well as providing a simple but powerful enough set of tools; reliability and a general good approach to user interaction has meant that after a couple of weeks I eventually subscribed although free was good enough for my initial purposes and evaluation.  Take from that what you will but I wholeheartedly recommend it and also love their very quick iterative release process.  I don't know what your websites audience is but generally I think it's a bad idea to edit a live website. Much too easy to accidentally break something or worse  your passwords or other secrets by accident. I run my server from home so this will not be available to everyone but this is basically what I dp: If you have access to Google Chrome editor I think you should try ShiftEdit or SourceKit Apps from the web store. This one is specialized on PHP: click File Manager then select a file and click Code Editor. : I tried using it and it can highlight PHP and HTML (at the same time) and it also has a ""code completion"" feature... I'm not sure if that's what it's called but when you write an opening bracket or quote it writes the closing one after the cursor. The only problems are that the highlighting isn't perfect (it treats escaped quotes as actual quotes) and more importantly it's not free. Etherpad is cool to code collectively but it has no syntax highlighting and is not realy an IDE just a collaborative pad for programmers with versioning and chat features.Still pretty cool but not what youre looking for. We are making exactly this happen at very simple and useful php editor - to edit your scripts on FTP server  The new platform by the ""phpanywhere"" Team. I found it to be working very well. Interesting about it making it special is the Android and Iphone app which actually enables you to really code on the go. Thats an interesting idea.  One could use something like this:  to the syntax highlighting then it's just a matter of code completion for things like functions. That much is relatively simple it gets harder when you get into things like per file (or even included file) variables (for the code completion). And now that you have me thinking...

77,intellij idea - Managing keyboard shortcut conflicts between IDE and OS (Ubuntu) ,"I'm using IntelliJ IDEA but I think this applies to any IDE. In IDEA some  conflict with Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts. Some examples: I've been using Ubuntu for a long time and I'm used to these shortcuts. I use them all the time to switch between workspaces lock my session... At the same time I know how useful the IntelliJ shortcuts can be and I want to avoid using the mouse as much as possible. Currently my workaround for ""format source code"" is I use Ubuntu as well and I disabled the native (Ubuntu) command  to format the code and  for navigating backward Hope this helps This works for me in Ubuntu Studio 14.04 (XFCE): In order to disable XUbuntu's (xfce) keymap for  and I used .  Here I was able to clear these mappings. From the link to feature request provided by CrazyCoder: Actually there are several bundled schemes: ""Default for GNOME"" ""Default for KDE"" created exactly for that purpose.  I have not checked now particular shortcuts like Ctrl+Alt+L but these schemes were created to avoid conflicts with GNOME and KDE respectively. ""Default for Gnome"" did the trick for me (I'm on ArchLinux Gnome3 AndroidStudio/InteliJ) it remapped Navigate/Back to Shift+Alt+Left (was Ctrl+Alt+Left from ""Default for XWin"" and it didn't work). But now it switches may keyboard layout as well (Shift+Alt) another problem )) Probably I'll remap keypad switcher to something else it is still simpler then reassigning all the conflicting keys in IDE/OS. In 'Settings' section 'Keymap' you can choose the keymaps template from XWin Gnome Visual Studio Eclipse etc... This solve any problem in Ubuntu by choosing Gnome."

89,java - How to call a SOAP web service on Android ,"I am having a lot of trouble finding good information on how to call a standard SOAP/WSDL web service with Android. All I've been able to find are either very convoluted documents and references to ""kSoap2"" and then some bit about parsing it all manually with  based web service from an Android-based phone.Android does not provide any sort of SOAP library. You can either write your own or use something like . As you note others have been able to compile and use kSOAP2 in their own projects but I haven't had to. Google has shown to date little interest in adding a SOAP library to Android. My suspicion for this is that they'd rather support the current trends in Web Services toward REST-based services and using JSON as a data encapsulation format. Or using XMPP for messaging. But that is just conjecture. XML-based web services are a slightly non-trivial task on Android at this time. Not knowing NetBeans I can't speak to the tools available there but I agree that a better library should be available. It is possible that the XmlPullParser will save you from using SAX but I don't know much about that.  comes in the Android SDK by default. That'll get you connected to the WSDL. It's true that due to it's overhead SOAP is not the best choice for data exchange with mobile devices. However you might find yourself in situation in which you do not control the format of server output. So if you have to stick with SOAP there is a kSOAP2 library patched for Android here: Basically it allows you to build up envelopes to send via a simple Java API then automatically parses them into objects that you define via XPath... for example: Becomes: I was using it for my own project but I figured it might help some other people so I've spent some time separating it out and documenting it.

96,macos - Best PHP IDE for Mac? (Preferably free!) ,I need to find a good  but would prefer a free one.  Any suggestions?  Thanks!Free! Plus the best functionality of all offerings. Includes inline database connections code completion syntax checking color coding split views etc.  Downside: It's a memory hog on the Mac.  Be prepared to allow half a gig of memory then you'll need to shut down and restart. A step above a Text Editor. Does not support database connections or split views. Color coding and syntax checking are there to an extent. The project control on Komodo is very unwieldy and strange compared to the other IDEs. The perfect solution.  Eclipsed based and uses the Aptana PHP plug in. Real time syntax checking word wrap drag and drop split views database connections and a slew of other excellent features.  Downside:  Not a supported product any more.  Aptana Studio 2.0+ uses PDT which is a watered down under-developed (at present) php plug in. Good for Javascript/HTML/CSS but only marginal for PHP. There is some color coding but no syntax checking or code completion native to the package. Database connections are supported and so are split views. I'm using NetBeans which is free and feature rich. I can deal with the memory issues for a while but it could be slow coming to the MAC. Cheers!Korky KathmanSenior PartnerEntropy Dynamics LLC Komodo is wonderful and it runs on OS X; they have a free version Komodo Edit.   from 2015: I've switched to PHPStorm from Jetbrains the same folks that built IntelliJ IDEA and Resharper.

103,Best IDE/Editor for ColdFusion? ,"I am just starting at a job in which I will be using a lot of ColdFusion. What is the best IDE/Editor to use?I'd like to provide my personal reasoning behind why you might choose any of these editors (at least the ones I'm familiar with). Just saying ""use this use that"" is not at all helpful. To large degree the question is wrong. There's rarely a ""best IDE"" for a language; rather there are multiple environments each suiting particular needs. Here goes: 1) Dreamweaver Why you would use it: its history as a designer tool makes it much easier for ""non-coder"" types to start cranking out websites. If you're a solo developer building a lot of ""Tom's Corner Store"" type of sites even if they require some CF Coding (mailing list subscribers current specials light content management etc) its design tools ""template"" features and ease-of-deployment (ftp) make it an attractive choice. It has good-enough code coloring and code completion for the built-in CF tags and functions. It can interrogate user-defined functions in the same page. It has excellent CSS support. You can find a wealth of extensions too.  It's pretty stable and in my experience hasn't been very ""crashy"". It will do a fair amount of code generation for you as well (whether that code is ""good"" is debatable).  All in all Dreamweaver is incredible software for web site designers. Why you wouldn't use it: It is not free and it is certainly not a ""coder's editor"". While it provides for extensions they're typically interface-focused (javascript validation etc) unlike say Eclipse plugins which can run the gamut. For large projects it simply does not have the code navigation features that many coders come to expect. It's web-focused. So if you're a polyglot or even just like to dabble in compiled languages (java etc) then you'll need to keep another editor on hand for those tasks.... you won't be able to do it all in one place.  ColdFusion unit testing support is nonexistent in Dreamweaver. There is no step debugging for ColdFusion. 2) CFEclipse plugged into Eclipse.  Why you'd use it: CFEclipse is going on 6 years old now and has matured significantly. It's been quite stable for the last few years and most crashiness has been due to Eclipse itself and not CFEclipse (which was not true in the early days). Recently CFEclipse has seen an infusion of fresh blood and features are being added to make coding in it even more productive.  It contains a wealth of keyboard shortcuts many of the toolbar features people love from ColdFusion Studio days and Eclipse's in-built code navigation features (namely Ctrl-Shift-R for finding files quickly). It has content assist for native CF Tags and functions and some support for in-page variables though that's never worked all that well. It does not support in-page functions nor does it provide native true component insight (i.e. insight into components that you write and use in other code). It will support component insight to some extent with Dictionaries but even then it requires a lot of work on the part of the dictionary creator. Most people find dictionaries too much work to maintain in my experience. The lastest version of CFEclipse contains the best CFML formatting you'll find.  For me ""method explorer"" and ""Snip Tree View"" -- particularly keyboard shortcuts for inserting snippets -- have been big productivity boosters. If you work with ColdSpring ModelGlue Mach-II ColdBox and other frameworks with xml configuration files CFEclipse's Framework Explorer is brilliant. Because it's a plugin to Eclipse you can do everything else you'd want to do in Eclipse. You wanna code java? You can. You want webservice support? you got that. You want to do step debugging you can do so with the free Adobe-provided extensions for Eclipse. The large plugin ecosystem is one of the most attractive features of Eclipse and you shouldn't discount this when deciding on an editor. For example I would not want to work without Mylyn which integrates with issue tracking and in my experience has transformed the way I work much for the better. Eclipse's version control system support is excellent as well. Subversion is well supported; there's a VSS plugin; and recently a git plugin (if not two) has been accepted into the Eclipse foundation so we'll see native git support very soon (you can get it now with a plugin). Eclipse's ANT support is excellent.  You can easily plug the MXUnit Eclipse plugin into Eclipse for unit testing your CFML (full disclosure: I contribute to MXUnit). Finally I have full confidence that the folks working on CFEclipse -- Denny Mark Jim Peter et al. -- will continue to work toward keeping CFEclipse as the best open source CFML IDE available. These are some of the brightest minds in the ColdFusion community and are passionate about their mission. If you choose to use CFEclipse you are not choosing to use an IDE that will be supplanted by ColdFusion Builder. This project is in good hands. Why you wouldn't use it: it's a code IDE not a design tool like Dreamweaver. It's not perfect... code assist can be too aggressive in its suggestions. Eclipse itself especially when you pile it up with all kinds of plugins can get unstable on lesser machines.  Finally people who don't like the ""Project"" view of the world often have complaints about it because they're used to working directly with the file system view of the world. Its deployment support is nowhere near as simple as Dreamweaver though you can find plugins that get close. 3) ColdFusion Builder Why you'd use it: all of what I said previously about Eclipse itself applies to CFBuilder when used as a plugin to Eclipse. I cannot speak to the Standalone version because as of this writing it still doesn't support plugins very well. This will most surely be fixed by the time it is released but I don't want to speculate on what the Standalone may or may not do. One of CFBuilder's big draws is ""Extensions"". These are a way to plug in CFML code into your editor. It's hard to describe so I'd suggest googling for ""ColdFusion Builder Extensions"" and you'll most likely be amazed. Adobe's Terry Ryan has created ""Apptacular"" for scaffolding applications from a database and Brian Rinaldi has a series of posts on building CFBuilder extensions. These are huge and will prove themselves to be a developer's best friend after CFBuilder is released. CFBuilder's deployment support is in my opinion on par with if not superior to Dreamweaver's. CFBuilder does not require an additional plugin to do step debugging. Just hit the debug button and off you go. CFBuilder contains true component insight meaning that it can introspect components you write and provide ctrl-space content assist. It can be wonky however and does require some configuration. But please remember that as of now CFBuilder is still in beta. My best guess is that it'll be at least a few versions until all the kinks are worked out of this feature. Still it's a big productivity and learning booster to get content assist on your own components. CFBuilder provides a ""Servers"" view for stopping/starting your CF Server. It's built on Aptana and so contains the Aptana ""tail log"" view which is great for watching log files. Just like CFEclipse it has a Snip Tree View. The CFBuilder ""vision"" is led by Adobe's Adam Lehman. He's passionate about CF and is a force of nature. I have great hopes for CFBuilder because of Adam's leadership. Why you wouldn't use it: For one it won't be free. Noone outside Adobe knows yet how much it will cost however. ""Extensions"" and the deployment features alone may be worth the price. Time will tell. Because it's an Adobe product I think it's reasonable to assume that releases will come as frequently as most Adobe products which means... not very often. While CFEclipse deploys rather frequently lately -- and makes available a ""nightly"" site for the brave -- CFBuilder will most likely not do such daring-do. CFEclipse can afford to make potentially unstable builds available to the public while it is perhaps not in Adobe's best interests to do so with CFBuilder. Finally it's still in Beta and might not be released for some time. If you get it now and start using it remember that. In my experience debugging is wonky content assist sometimes works sometimes doesn't and a lot of people have experience crashiness. It's free beta software... you're getting what you pay for. But know that the more you work with this beta release and particularly if you provide feedback via the public bug database the better off all of us will be if it provides a best of breed editor for CFML. Personally: At home when I do ""designer"" work I use Dreamweaver when I feel that its Templates will help me build a site as quickly as possible. For existing side projects which require maintenance coding and easy deployments I use ColdFusion builder. At work where I do almost no design work CFEclipse has been my IDE since 2006. I've begun using ColdFusion builder a lot though currently I split my time between CFBuilder and CFEclipse. One reason is that as of this writing CFEclipse is more stable (i.e. it doesn't crash and I don't lose work). I fully expect stability problems to be mitigated by the time CFBuilder costs money.  Both CFBuilder and CFEclipse have public bug databases. CFEclipse has a well-attended public mailing list and if you have questions you'll get answers quickly. I cannot yet speak to the speed with which CFBuilder questions are answered. Finally for ""coders"" it's my experience that once you invest the time in learning the tools and shortcuts Eclipse provides superior productivity compared with designer tools like Dreamweaver. For cranking out a designed site a designer tool like Dreamweaver confers significant advantages. The answer to the best ColdFusion IDE isn't an answer but a question: ""What are you trying to do with ColdFusion?"" The answer to that question will lead you to an IDE that suits your needs for a particular project. Different circumstances or projects may lead you to a different tool which better suits your needs. Notepad++ with CF syntax highlighting. For free: Eclipse with CFEclipes plugin For cost: If you're a developer use Coldfusion Builder if you're a front end designer Dreamweaver edits Coldfusion pretty well. I use it quite often. I have heavily used Dreamweaver CFeclipse with eclipse and now Coldfusion Builder.  What I found is this:  - This is Adobe's version of CFeclipse.  It's still pretty new and getting to later beta.  I switched to it about 6 months ago and haven't looked back.  It's got a lot of wizards including the ability to write your own plugins in CFML that will run right inside CFbuilder.  It's free right now on beta but will likely be pretty cheap like the first flex builder that came out. My Choice: Coldfusion Builder.  It doesn't mean the others aren't capable but you'll spend the least amoutn of time getting setup and maintaining your plugins etc.   Since I had paid for and used Dreamweaver for a lot of years (Eclipse was generally sluggish sometimes on PCs' a while back until the excess of ram + cpu today) spending to have an adobe maintained copy of eclipse is okay with me.  The wizards available in CFbuilder especially for flex are excellent. Hope that helps good luck and share what you ended up picking and why! For anyone who might stumble here from Google you should also take a look at  and other community driven content.   Some of the highlights of E is that it will allow you to open a directory and treat it directory as a project. Hitting Shift-Ctrl T will allow you to browse all the files in your project in a flattened hierarchy which allows you to find files extremely fast. "
106,Selenium IDE - sideflow.js loops ,I wanted to create testcase with loops. I got latest : latest from this page  How to make it work? Thanks in advance.If you want to create a loop the following is suggested. I am still learning so I am not sure but this has worked for me. Instead of  write it as Here is an example triple array looper (With static variables so you can see it changing) This is a custom one I have made notice the syntax for storing incremental variables (Such as counters e.t.c.) This looper will cycle through all of your options (In the example below there are 6*5*4=120 options). It echo's each option out once and then moves onto the next one. I opted to remove all the html tagging (So the gaps should be quite evident). StoreEval command is best for holding your loop counters because you can then use them as incrementals in one step instead of 2.
108,eclipse - How do you debug PHP scripts? ,"How do you debug  (in terms of fast and easy) way to debug in phpStorm or any other IDE?Try  which I never used. I use Netbeans with XDebug. Check it out at its website for docs on how to configure it.  The add-on is essential when you debug MVC projects because the normal way XDebug runs in Netbeans is to register the dbug session via the url. With the add-on installed in FireFox you would set your Netbeans project properties -&gt; Run Configuratuion -&gt; Advanced and select ""Do Not Open Web Browser"" You can now set your break points and start the debugging session with Ctrl-F5 as usual. Open FireFox and right-click the Add-on icon in the right bottom corner to start monitoring for breakpoints. When the code reaches the breakpoint it will stop and you can inspect your variable states and call-stack. Output buffering is very useful if you don't want to mess up your output. I do this in a one-liner which I can comment/uncomment at will  PhpEdit has a built in debugger but I usually end up using echo(); and print_r(); the old fashioned way!! For the really gritty problems that would be too time consuming to use print_r/echo to figure out I use my IDE's (PhpEd) debugging feature.  Unlike other IDEs I've used PhpEd requires pretty much no setup.  the only reason I don't use it for any problems I encounter is that it's > slow.  I'm not sure that slowness is specific to PhpEd or any php debugger.  PhpEd is not free but I believe it uses one of the open-source debuggers (like XDebug previously mentioned) anyway.  The benefit with PhpEd again is that it requires no setup which I have found really pretty tedious in the past. Manual debugging is generally quicker for me -  in the tmp folder and tail it in the terminal with the command... It give's you running dialog from cake of what is going on which is pretty handy if you want to output something to it mid code you can use. This can usually give you a good idea of what is going on/wrong. print_r( debug_backtrace() ); or something like that :-) Komodo IDE works well with xdebug even for the remore debugging. It needs minimum amount of configuration. All you need is a version of php that Komodo can use locally to step through the code on a breakpoint. If you have the script imported into komodo project then you can set breakpoints with a mouse-click just how you would set it inside eclipse for debugging a java program.Remote debugging is obviously more tricky to get it to work correctly ( you might have to map the remote url with a php script in your workspace ) than a local debugging setup which is pretty easy to configure if you are on a MAC or a linux desktop. Nusphere is also a good debugger for php There are many PHP debugging techniques that can save you countless hours when coding. An effective but basic debugging technique is to simply turn on error reporting. Another slightly more advanced technique involves using print statements which can help pinpoint more elusive bugs by displaying what is actually going onto the screen. PHPeclipse is an Eclipse plug-in that can highlight common syntax errors and can be used in conjunction with a debugger to set breakpoints. and also used In a production environment I log relevant data to the server's error log with error_log(). i use zend studio for eclipse with the built in debugger. Its still slow compared to debugging with eclipse pdt with xdebug. Hopefully they will fix those issues the speed has improved over the recent releases but still stepping over things takes 2-3 seconds.The zend firefox toolbar really makes things easy (debug next page current page etc). Also it provides a profiler that will benchmark your code and provide pie-charts execution time etc. The most of bugs can be found easily by simply ing some of key variables but it obviously depends on what kind of application you develop. For a more complex algorithms the step/breakpoint/watch functions are very helpful (if not necessary) The Interactive Stepthrough PHP Debugger implemented as a SAPI module which can give give you complete control over the environment without impacting the functionality or performance of your code. It aims to be a lightweight powerful easy to use debugging platform for PHP 5.4+ and it's shipped out-of-box with PHP 5.6. Features includes: See the screenshots:  at php.net +1 for print_r(). Use it to dump out the contents of an object or variable. To make it more readable do it with a pre tag so you don't need to view source.  Also var_dump($thing) - this is very useful to see the type of subthings Depending on the issue I like a combination of error_reporting(E_ALL) mixed with echo tests (to find the offending line/file the error happened in initally; you KNOW it's not always the line/file php tells you right?) IDE brace matching (to resolve ""Parse error: syntax error unexpected $end"" issues) and print_r(); exit; dumps (real programmers view the source ;p).  You also can't beat phpdebug (check sourceforge) with ""memory_get_usage();"" and ""memory_get_peak_usage();"" to find the problem areas. The integrated debuggers where you can watch the values of variable change as you step through code are really cool. They do however require software setup on the server and a certain amount of configuration on the client. Both of which require periodic maintenance to keep in good working order. A print_r is easy to write and is guaranteed to work in any setup. Usually I find create a custom log function able to save on file store debug info and eventually re-print on a common footer. You can also override common Exception class so that this type of debugging is semi-automated."
111,Why would a Delphi programmer use Lazarus as the IDE instead of using Delphi's IDE? ,I've been very happy with the Delphi IDE for programming in Delphi.  But I've heard about the  says: The first thing to do when converting  a Delphi project  Having opened  Lazarus you should go to to Tools and  then Convert Delphi Project to Lazarus  Project. This won't do everything for  you but nonetheless will take you a  good deal of the way. Note that the  Lazarus IDE's conversion tools are  generally one-way conversions. If you  need to retain Delphi compatibility so  you can compile your project with both  Delphi and Lazarus consider  converting your files with the XDev  ToolkitWell a Delphi programmer cannot use Lazarus to write Delphi code because Lazarus is not Delphi. Lazarus is actually an IDE and a bunch of Delphi-ish class libraries for Free Pascal. But note things like Delphi's VCL is not there and to be perfectly blunt the IDE and debugging experiences in Lazarus are pretty spotty however it is free so that counts for a lot. Bottom line Delphi &lt;&gt; Lazarus. Use Delphi if you want a great IDE and debugger huge 3rd party support and tech suport you are targeting MS Windows plus you are willing to pay for it. Use Lazarus (free pascal) if you want a Free IDE that supports multiple platforms and has a Delphi-ish syntax. Ok. This is an old thread but could do with some updating. I stopped using Delphi maybe a decade ago largely because I had no choice. Having spent 5+ years working as a Delphi coder I was now a student again and the prices for Delphi were simply outrageous.  The problem with Delphi was never Delphi. Delphi was a genius system but Borland (and later its successors) completely misunderstood the changing computer world. Microsoft was able to deliver a programming environment that you could download for free and its .NET environment was comparable with the VCL in all the important ways meanwhile even a basic version of Delphi would break your bank or be plain out unavailable to student budgets. The end result is that with no new Delphi programmers coming on-line it became a risky proposition for businesses to continue to use. Finally with the rise of linux Kylix turned out to be a total trainwreck of an environment not utilizing available UI toolchains and with a suspicious stench of Wine pervading it topped off with an insulting attitude to GPL software that treated it as if it was shareware. Finally when Turbo Delphi came out many years later it was unable to utilize the amazing resources available via sites like tories component sites. It was clear Borland had no respect at all for its coder ecosystem. So Lazarus seemed to emerge out of all this taking a very long time to gestate and seemingly aiming at some sort of analogue to Delphi 4 held by many to be one of the cleanest and neatest in the Delphi line. It complied to just about everything its implementation of Object Pascal was spot-on and most importantly it was free in all the senses that matter to open source. However it has had a long history of bugginess and incomplete implementations of its controls. And this was bit of a deal breaker for me and many others. With that said I recently decided to download it out of curiosity and found that it's actually come a hell of a long way. The database components just work although you might need to follow a few tutorials and chase some leads around to get them all up and running and serious progress has been made towards iPhone and Android build targets.  I'm not sure I'm ready to deploy this to any of my commercial clients yet but I'm going to give it another run with a personal project to put it through its paces and if it does work I think I'm finally going to be re-united with my first programming love Pascal and in a matter that lets me use my Mac to do the heavy lifting whilst providing Windows and Linux builds.  So basically here are the facts on the comparison;-Lazarus and Delphi are totally separate entities. Lazarus is NOT a cross compiler for Delphi but has a certain degree of compatibility. Its more like GCC vs MS C++. Delphi is more polished and likely more stable.Lazarus provides a Delphi 4 like environment that old-hand Delphi coders will find very comfortable.but Lazarus can be temperamental at times and Delphi programmers need to understand that not everything in the latest and greatest Delphis will be there for them.Delphi does Windows and it does it very well (yes I know the new one has some cross compilation targets but word on the street is that it's a bit hacky and needs some time in the embacardo cooker before it's really there) whilst Lazarus complies to almost everything. The current target list is;- Darwin NetBSD OpenBSD FreeBSD Linux Solaris Win32 Win64 WinCE go32v2 (I think that's MS-DOS with 32bit extensions!) OS2 Netware(!) BEOS Haiku(?!) QNX wdosx(?) emx netwlibc Atari Amiga Palm-os Gameboy advance nds MacOS Morphos Plus there's experimental support for IOS and Android. On top of this the thing can use widget sets from  QT GTK GTK2 Win32/WIn64 Carbon fpGUI(no idea) Cocoa or no GUI at all with various degrees of implementation transparency.  Its an exhaustive list!  So Caveat Emptor. I strongly recommend Delphi coders download this and do some personal projects to get a feel for it not on the boss' dime but there's a lot of depth and substance to Lazarus and it's potentially a vital tool in the belt for dealing with life outside the Windows crib. Plus since Delphi's new masters still haven't learned a !@#$%^&amp;* thing about why Delphi fell from grace (Hint make it affordable or free to hobbyists and students to learn and create custom components)  it's really the only budget option available. If Embarcadero ever wake up maybe that will change. Until then viva Lazarus. The two main reasons for me are 1) Multiplatforms support (Linux Mac OS X Windows)  2) The price $0 Maybe I'm just reading this wrong but you seem to be under the impression that the IDEs are somehow interchangeable.  That's not correct.  Lazarus is built on top of the FPC compiler and is tied to it in much the same way that Delphi is tied to the DCC compiler.  Also they use different form description file formats.  Delphi can't read LFMs and Lazarus can try to read DFMs but it doesn't do a particularly good job of it. FPC/Lazarus is very similar to Delphi but it's a different dialect of Object Pascal and it would be a mistake to think they're equivalent. Lazarus is cross-platform and free both as in speech and beer while Delphi is neither. Lazarus does use a  is a powerful one click installation package for cross platform native Delphi like RAD/IDE based on Lazarus/FreePascal that eliminates painful cross platform setup. You can start coding just few minutes after the download so if cross platform 64 bits or price are key benefits for you then choose Lazarus over Delphi. Lazarus is highly compatible to Delphi and I have converted few applications without much problems. It is possible to maintain code that compiles on both. I don't have that much new to add but I thought I'd relate my crossplatform experience. As far as putting together a cross platform application sketch fairly quickly I find Lazarus to work very nicely. I've recently been using MonoDevelop of which there is much to commend but the gui designer stetic doesn't seem as complete as the Lazarus GUI designer. Or is it the toolkit (GTK#) that seems to lack some bits? Before that I've used Qt / C++ which also seemed to work out fairly well for crossplatform development but I'm not real keen on C++ and Qt's signal/slot framework is a bit curious but works well once you get your head wrapped around it. In sum I find RAD work and coding using Lazarus to be mostly joyful besides what a cool name for an IDE! Cheers
115,simulation - IDE for GPSS language ,GPSS stands for . And it looks like that the language is more dead than alive (I didn't find good and actual blog or web site). I began studying this language a few weeks ago and faced with the lack of good IDE. I have to work with GPSS World and a don't like this system. Does anyone know if there is any IDE or IDE-like system to work with GPSS? My dream is about intellisense good run-time debugger etc. P.S. Sorry but i can't create a new tag 'gpss'. Thanks.FastForward to 2016: I have used Wolverine's GPSS\H professional and student version.  There are several variations of GPSS and there are many other non-GPSS alternatives.     AGPSS has a GPSS has IDE.  A Toolbox GPSS-version exists for MATLAB (subset of commands).   GPSS's (Wolverine version) strength lies in that is computationally very efficient (lean) because it precedes Win-Tel \ DOS.  The successor to GPSS\H is Wolverine's SLX and both are considered to be at the forefront of speed and capability.  The student versions are available for download and evaluation Ok It's time to answer and finally close the question. As I told to  there are some companies in Russia but I didn't see their result.  However I found the one solution - . But I do not know if the development is in progress or the project already died. You can figure it out by yourself. As to me I would choose AnyLogic instead of GPSS. Thanks. I'm studing in UBA. We are using SNAKE in the Simulation course.
124,Any good visual HTML5 Editor or IDE? ,"Well it looks like Dreamweaver CS5 will try to smoother the HTML5 thing for a few more years (weeks actually).

Topstyle 4 is the only one I've com e across with HTML5 (and CSS3) support. Its early stages but it works enough for the most part. Since HTML5 is still in the works and doesn't have consistant support across any browsers yet my guess is that it's going to be quite a while before you get a WYSIWYG HTML5 Editor. In the mean time get used to editting your markup by hand in a good text editor like  has nice support for HTML5. Previously I was a heavy user of Eclipse but spend more time with NetBeans to play with HTML5 and Servlet. for online solution try maqetta and aloha editor for offline solution (download-able) try blue griffon they are free :)oh yeah one more my favorite editor :) and game editor also: construct2 Coffee Cup Just released one.

I have a model which uses the Eloquent facade  method is highlighted and flagged as Method 'findOrFail' not found in class App\Article. I am new to Laravel and the concept of Facades but am lost and have been unable to find an existing answer for my problem.Have you tried ? If you have problems during generation you could also just copy the pre-generated gist: Source:  As far as findOrFail goes I've had luck using class CLASSNAME extends \Eloquent instead of class CLASSNAME extends Model within your Model. This workaround will cause it to use the helper file so I believe you will need to deploy WITH the ide-helper file but I'm not certain. That will get most of them working it seems however I'm still having issues getting where to work within my Model not sure if it has to do with how I'm calling it $query-&gt;where(... but using \Eloquent seems to fix most of the methods.

144,VHDL language IDE ,  can anybody tell me IDE where i can write VHDL codes? both have IDES available for free download. At least as of a few years ago when I was using it regularly the Xilinx software didn't handle updates well at all -- to the point that if you decide to use it I'd recommend installing it in a virtual machine and if you ever decide to update it do a clean install into a fresh VM image. Your simulator software should have a primitive ID. Xilinx Altera Cadence ModelSim all have primitive VHDL and Verilog IDEs. Actually most HDL developers I've worked with don't use the IDEs except for non-HDL related tasks like top-level schematic capture routing and analysis.  On the teams I've worked on Notepadd++ was popular as well as Vi and Emacs.  I never had a license for it but one partner company used Visual SlickEdit for all of its editing.  It seemed like a nice tool. We used Cadence when I was doing my EE undergrad. No complaints (which is rare for university-provided software).

152,c++ - How to configure CLion IDE for Qt Framework? ,"How to configure CLion IDE for Qt Framework?Is this IDE compatible with Qt or are there other IDEs compatible with Qt? I just want to try to use something else than Qt Creator.I was as desperate as you until I read .It worked perfectly for me! To summarize there are 2 main steps: Firstly CLion uses CMake to compile your code. It is based on CMake configuration files (e.g ""CMakeLists.txt""). You have to add Qt based CMake commands (the lines with 'find_package' and 'target_link_libraries'): Secondly CLion has to use the  binary installed by Qt. For that go to:'Preferences' -&gt; 'Build Execution Deployment' -&gt; 'CMake' and in 'CMake options' append the CMake path that Qt uses which should be in the directory where Qt is installed. For instance on OSX: You can test that everything is working fine by doing a little test script in  and adding in the last line: You can do this with all the other Qt5 modules. This approach is one of the simplest way to be used for the newest >: CMakeLists.txt: Resource files (.qrc) should be added to add_executable list inorder for moc to be able to run its procedure on the resource and theinternal file like qmls texts ... be accessible. qml files should be included in a qrc file and load using > you used a beautifier like ""Uncrustify"" to auto beautify the code on saving a source file then: As Tom Lank mentions Qt projects can now be managed with and built under CMake which makes CLion happy. . One thing that isn't mentioned in the Qt CMake manual or above is that you'll also need the lines: All of these calls to  file as a project in CLion.Most likely you'll need to tell CMake where to find your Qt packages with a line like this before your 's: Finally if you're running on / building for windows Qt no longer comes pre-built with GCC/Mingw32 libraries. You need to build with visual studio. Luckily  and I've found it to work for Qt projects; just be sure to set the architecture (under Settings-&gt;Build Execution Development-&gt;CMake) to x86_amd64 in order to build in 64-bit mode and be compatible with Qt's pre-build libs. All of this is tested with CLion 2017.1 Qt 5.9 and the Visual Studio 2015 compiler. You can build QT applications in CLion. QT Provides CMake modules that take care of all details.  The following CMake script builds the example application '). You can easily develop Qt with VC Eclipse CLion etc. when you use CMake as a build tool. CMake will generate the project files for each IDE. I was using several IDEs this way. After this journey I am an even happier user of Qt Creator.  The only thing you need is to add QT install  to your PATH. Don't forget to restart PC afterwards because CLion for some reason isn't able to refresh the path only full pc restart helps. "
157,objective c - Apple iOS IDE for linux? ,"I am interested in getting to know whether there is an IDE to develop for Apple iOS? I am currently learning Objective-C but I don't have a Macbook or something like that. So actually I am looking for an ""all around"" IDE including: What else would I need to develop iPhone apps on Ubuntu (if that's possible)? Thank you for any suggestions.What you are asking for is neigh impossible. The only solution I could think of to develop on Linux would be to use GCC or Clang to compile Objective-C. There are no Apple Frameworks or simulators save GnuStep and that isn't 100% compatible. There are a few problems.  The iOS SDK libraries don't exist for Linux.  The simulator does not exist for Linux.  How do you plan to sign your app from Linux? You could technically use a VM but that is against the Mac OS X EULA. Another sketchy option is to compile against GNUStep and test on a jailbroken device.  Honestly your best bet is to break the bank and get a Mac (Mini or Air now that the MacBook is discontinued. That said you might consider spending a bit more on a larger screen. It's really hard to write code on just 11 inches of screen.) A few moths of developing may make back your initial investment.  Good luck! While probably not producing native looking apps there are a couple cross-platform multimedia  tool-stacks like the  for info on this. Basically running a virtual machine with an OSX image is likely to be the best approach if you'd like to distribute your app through the Apple store."

Is there any cool IDE or a simple editor for C with a unix terminal like feel ( on it :)) What other editors/IDE are as robust as gcc for windows? Also what is your personal favorite. I would like a try a few of the those before I stick with one. Thanks.If you are used to a Unix-y feel and are looking for a text editor I'd honestly avoid installing Visual Studio. It's a nice IDE but it is very heavyweight and perhaps much more than you are asking for. That said you might of course find that you like it but be aware that you are potentially looking at a several-hundred-megabytes download 2 gigs for the full package IIRC. Netbeans is good too but fairly heavy and a little difficult to get set up correctly with C and C++ at least last time I tried. It's a good alternative to VS though. I'd go for a more lightweight solution like Notepad++ vim for Windows or my personal favourite Geany -  - cross platform free IDE designed for GNU toolchain. Visual Studio 2010 has an express edition that's doanloadable for free. .  Personally I tend to use both. I heavily lean towards Visual Studio 2010 but occasionally compile using gcc to make sure that both compilers are working the same way. This used to be beneficial in the past (pre VS2010) but I haven't had much success in catching VS2010 make mistakes - yet.  In terms of the overall experience of integrated development debugging etc. it's hard to beat VS2010.  Net beansCode blockDev c++code lite are good IDE

Autocomplete in HSQL expressions in Hibernate configuration (including class property and DB column names) in Spring configuration and it will show you list of those beans which you can inject into that property.  Very smart autocomplete in Java code: and it shows you ONLY > functions in your project. Did I mention autocomplete and ctrl-clicking in paths to files like &lt;script src="""" &lt;img src="""" etc? Autocomplete in HTML tag attributes. Autocomplete in style attribute of HTML tags both attribute names and values. Autocomplete in class attributes as well.Type &lt;div class=""&lt;CTRL-SPACE&gt; and it will show you list of CSS classes defined in your project. Pick one ctrl-click on it and you will be redirected to where it is defined. Latest version has language injection so you can declare that you custom JSTL tag usually contains JavaScript and it will highlight JavaScript inside it. You can use Find Usages of any Java class or method and it will find where it is used including not only Java classes but Hibernate Spring JSP and other places. Rename Method refactoring renames method not only in Java classes but anywhere including comments (it can not be sure if string in comments is really method name so it will ask).

187,IDE for Android ,I used to lug my huge laptop all over the place but now I have a Galaxy Tab 10.1. Im loving the lighter baggage and I can do everything I can do on my laptop expect for the most important thing develop. The main reason for this is because i cant find a decent ide that runs on Android so I'm putting the question out there. Is there and ide i can run on the Android platform?Directly on android? No I don't think so.   However it is possible to install ubuntu on a tablet.  Then you could use eclipse or any other linux IDE I suppose.  Heres a video showing you how to install ubuntu on a tablet.  supports the full edit-compile-run cycle for Android Apps and has a great editor. It works fine on my devices (Transformer Prime and Samsung Galaxy S2).
188,Go IDE With GUI Design Support ,I was taking a look on Go language but I want to know if there is any IDE developed only for it but that have a GUI design feature as Visual Studio and Netbeans.You can also find an Eclipse plugin here:  However at the moment of writing this is still at an early development stage. Go isn't really designed for GUIs - it's precisely designed to meet the kind of needs that Google has. I dare say it's entirely possible to develop GUI frameworks with/in it but it's not the team's priority as far as I'm aware. lite ide is little cross platform and open source.you can try it. editor. It's definitely  a Go GUI IDE but at least for me the gocode auto complete feature is great. You can also use Notepad++ for now there is a language file for it here: A programming environment by Rob Pike it is very different from a traditional IDE but if you are open-minded and get over the first shock it can be extremely pleasant to use. Use Cloud-IDE.com online editor and online deploy - All FREE !! I believe the best options for developing Go are TextWrangler Vim or BBedit. 
190,IDE autocompletion for javascript AMD loading style ,Does anyone know of an IDE that can autocomplete javascript AMD style : Please don't just give the best cool IDE you like. I tried Komodo and Webstorm I just couldn't make them work or maybe I had not configured them correctly...but none give the possibility to set the same alias as in dojoConfig (too difficult?).For example in Webstorm there is a library concept I added dojo and my package but no way of course how it could without knowing the alias paths. There is also a Path Variables concept no way to understand how it works the documentation is so poor! Thank for any help.You might be looking for TernJS.   It is the best tool I know for the job. Tern is rather RAM-hungry though (compared to a pure text editor).Integration with Sublime Text is seamless and with other Sublime plugins you can bring it quite close to a definition of IDE. Below is an excerpt from TernJS documentation: Tern is a stand-alone code-analysis engine for JavaScript. It is  intended to be used with a code editor plugin to enhance the editor's  support for intelligent JavaScript editing. Features provided are: Tern is open-source (MIT license) written in JavaScript and capable  of running both on node.js and in the browser. Editor plugins There is currently Tern support for the following editors: It hasn't autocomplete and shortcuts are little bit difficult:) But very useful for me.  Well I am using PHPStorm 8.1 (Webstorm should be ok also) now and...I just declare my js packages as javascript libraries : Settings &gt; Languages &amp; Frameworks &gt; JavaScript &gt; Libraries &gt; Add... add and point to each of your packages'folder and enjoy :) Have to mention JetBrains IDE rocks give it a try sure you will adopt it since - at least - it resolves AMD style...
191,Enthought TraitsUI based Python IDE ,Has anybody come across an Enthought TraitsUI (Envisage etc) based Python IDE? I wonder why there is none when Enthought Tool Suite makes it so easy to create extensible python GUI applications. One reason I can think  of why such an IDE makes a lot of sense is because it will be cross platform. Any reason why such an IDE does not make sense?Any reason why such an IDE does not  make sense? Most people who use Python don't use the Enthought tool suite so there's not enough interest to create a project (or demand for a company to sell a product). I know that's not what you want to hear so here's a few options: You can always use Eclipse or another open-source IDE as a backend and just build a new UI. [Full disclosure: I work at Enthought] I agree with you the stack Traits + TraitsUI/pyface + Envisage makes a lot of sense to build a crossplatform IDE and is fairly simple. If you are interested in learning the stack and building one yourself there are several open source examples that you could use to get started: We have also been working ourselves using that stack as the backbone. The next version of EPD currently in beta will ship with that IDE (free) in the coming couple months.

Can some one point how to add the pymongo library to the WING ide (or to any other IDE for that matter)? i want to get the auto-completion for commands. ThanksWell you can consider using Sublime text. You can run your python programs straight from your editor. It has autocompletion (suggest a listing for what you might have meant to type in). Though it won't suggest function names as in Netbeans or eclipse. But still its a very elegant editor used by many. Also you can  If you are in windows platform just install the pymongo.exe file and it will install in python directory. Then you will be able to access it in any IDE such PyCharm by typing:   import pymongo
200,Cloud9 IDE and C Programming ,"How can I write a C program in the IDE cloud9? Whenever I start to write its showing errors I even tried to change the file extension to "".C"" but it doesn't work. Does the cloud9 IDE support C programming?Yes Cloud9 does support C and C++ programming Cloud9 has a varying level of support for different programming languages and frameworks. Cloud9's ACE editor currently supports highlighting for about 60 programming languages including C/C++. The list is growing and you can get the full list from the ""View -&gt; Syntax"" menu. The editor has extensive support for JavaScript with error highlighting and code completion. It also has live syntax error checks for CSS CoffeeScript PHP Python JSON and Lua. The run menu supports running Each project is a unix sandbox with the standard tools like bash make gcc vim java SDK or perl installed. The terminal in Cloud9 is a full xterm compatible terminal emulator and you can use this to compile and run your C programs. Cloud9 also has a package manager called  which currently has about 120 packages. These packages include e.g. different versions of python and ruby mono lua or groovy. In case you still need additional tools or libraries you can always download them to your workspace and compile and install them there. As you see it is hard to draw the line of what is actually supported but usually you will have at least syntax highlighting in the editor and running from the console. It claims support on the web page for ""Javascript and Node.js applications as well as HTML CSS PHP Java Ruby and 23 other languages"". Yet it's > to turn you off the idea just stating that (based on my experience) it doesn't seem as good as a substantial number of other solutions. Cloud 9 does support C ( and C++ ) using gcc and g++ gcc --version (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-4) You can use their integrated editor but the run button still acts like it trying to execute Javascript which is the default and seems to be their the target audience. They have a fine C hello world example --  Typically I just maximize the terminal and run vim ( they have 7.2 installed ) and it works just like any passable unix terminal.  They also have gdb installed if you need a debugger. There are comparisons against installed compiler solutions but that isn't what Cloud9 is competing against.  Their own description is Google Docs for code and that seems to pretty fairly accurate.  It certainly isn't all things to all people but it is a pretty amazing service. With Cloud9 I can write code on my Chromebook without having to install a bunch of stuff to almost make Linux run on it.  This would be a good solution for students since it would allow them to work in a computer lab without needing any software installed.  I have found that using github and c9 I can easily switch back and forth between c9 while I am remote and a local setup when I am on a real computer."

219,python - Ninja-IDE virtualenv not importing ,"I started a new project in the Ninja-IDE and assigned it to a virtualenv folder in the settings. The virtualenv works fine in the terminal but Ninja-IDE doesn't recognize the packages in it and throws an import error. How can I access the packages in the virtualenv in Ninja-IDE? Thanks!One quick answer so that others may find it useful. I had a very similar problem a little while ago and had a lot of trouble finding a quick workable solution anywhere not even google. I somehow figured out that the solution was to simply create a virtualenv folder with the version of numpy I wanted and then pointed the ""virtualenv"" property for NinjaIDE project to that folder. I restarted NinjaIDE and boom instantly worked. To set the virtualenv property for your project via the GUI go to the Project menu: and you should see a variable called ""Virtualenv Folder"". Point that to the folder for your virtualenv and it should work. (May need to restart NinjaIDE.)  This worked for me NinjaIDE version 2.2 under Ubuntu 12.04. Edit by asker: If the above doesn't fix the problem try PyCharm-- it works for me."
220,Simple JavaScript IDE ,I am brand new to JavaScript and I would like practice my skills using a simple windows based IDE. While learning I do not want to use any CSS or HTML. I would like if possible to have colour single stepping highlighting and syntax checking.  So for example you could type in your function(s) call it and receive the result I would like something better than the Internet Explorer console.There are a lot of good online IDEs at the moment.One of my favorites is  Besides the options listed in the answers above; these are additional options I use when I need to write/test JS without HTML/CSS :  The Firefox Developer Edition browser offers a good console with all the necessary features to write JavaScript.  To cite a specific feature - ScratchPad provides you with a good option to write JS code and you can use the run button to view it on the console. As you can see below it has the syntax coloring and even the options to save and open files directly from your computer. 
223,javascript - PHP IDE with design view ,I am looking for a PHP IDE to work with that contains a design view like ASP .NET where i can add button tables menus automatically. So is there an IDE like that for PHP? Eclipse for PHP Developers does contain this exact thing - because it's a java desktop client though it is pretty 'clunky' but give it a whirl!  Edit -- Just realised you essentially want a drag and drop interface - You actually want a html editor with drag and drop functionality as PHP itself is just server side scripting there's a bit of a difference between ASP.NET (as it's a framework) and PHP which is an actual scripting language. PHP generally just renders HTML elements - in which case you're actually looking for a drag and drop HTML interface. I'm loathed to say it but the only one I'm aware of that's reliable (ish!) is Dreamweaver. The closest you can get to .NET/VB ide is having an editor with html widgets  also has some mode or add-on for html widgets. Now you need to be aware  > ... real men code their ui by hand.

227,ide-haskell for atom editor isn't working ,I'm trying to use the  package for atom but for some reason it's not working. First I have ghc-mod and stylish haskell installed in sandboxes under  etc. I'm also currently running linux not Mac so I had to add some keymappings: These register just fine and are visible in the ide-haskell's package settings. However issuing the keystroke doesn't do anything (It used to open a file and save-as respectively). Where am I most likely to have screwed up? I installed ide-haskell > finishing the ghc-mod installation but that shouldn't really matter... the links are correct. If anyone could help with this I would be ecstatic :)You need to create a cabal project in the directory you're working in. Just run cabal init and answer the questions. Then open atom in the current directory. The Haskell IDE menu should appear. I know this is old but I want to mention that if you are using  to run atom within your configured Haskell environment. That works great for me on Windows.
228,Alternative IDE for Stata ,I am used to R-studio for R which has some features such as guessing what function you are trying to type by pressing There is no full-blown IDE for Stata. The question comes up pretty often at Stata User Group meetings and StataCorp developers always say that they work in text editors. See  -- there's plentiful customization for syntax highlighting in every major text editor but that's as far as you would get I am afraid. HTHStasK P.S. Now that I thought about it a bit more it is possible to send your code from a text editor into Stata. There are some hints to that in the document I linked to and it floated up on Statalist a bunch of times. I just was not paying close enough attention as I simply  whenever I make major changes. P.P.S. (Aug 2016) I use WinEdt and it has a Stata mod that can send do-files to execute in Stata. Still that's no IDE in the sense that you don't see objects variables macros etc. You can use Sublime Text to highlight Stata code. I'm not sure how to run code from Sublime in Stata using ctrl+d.  For highlighting follow this: Download:  from: to do this in Linux though). I think this is the closest one can get to an IDE environment for Stata at least for the time being.

But some time we need to customize it and change preference.   What is superior customization and changes you do it in visual studio IDE and other IDE? an addin that lets you use vi key bindings in Visual Studio. You'd be surprised how much time this saves!

237,simple ide for php ,i try to use notepad++ but it don't show syntax of function. how can i solve it or may be any else simple ide? try to use eclipse\netbeans but this is big monsters This is not fully featured editor like big ones out there but very useful for quick editing and beginners alike :) Try this . StarPhP is a freeware editor for PHP  and HTML. This editor is specially  designed to be a lightweight and easy  to use application. It contains  features for both professional  programmers and beginners.  Notepad++ is a text editor and source code editor for Windows.Notepad++is definitely my favorite Notepad replacement because of the extensive features that it has built-in.I have used notepad++ and it give me a useful result. The main thing that makes Notepad++ fit well with the Firefox metaphor is the self-update check capability.  If you are thinking of trying emacs the following link would be helpful. It shows you how to setup php-mode and how to do syntax checking in emacs. I tried lots of IDE. Phpstrom is the best one I ever have. auto complete for php html and javascript. also work with VCS like GIT or others. can do deployment as well. try it you will like it.
244,3d - Real HLSL IDE/debugger ,Are there any IDE's for developing HLSL code?  The three key features I want are:1) syntax highlighting2) auto-complete3) interaction debugging Visual Studio doesn't do any of these things and it doesn't seem that RenderMonkey or FX Composer do either. Is there some IDE that I'm not aware of or does one of these three IDE's actually support these features and I'm too clueless to figure out how to use them properly?Have you actually tried ATI's RenderMoney or NVidia's FX Composer? Both actually provide syntax highlighting. Futher more NVidia's Cg toolkits actually allows you to enable syntaxhightling in Visual Studio with some custom setting. As for auto-completion I don't think it's much needed as compare to our normal programming. It's because you won't be writing a very long code for your shader programming. Shader is quite critical in that it is run on every frame generated and every instruction require 1 to a few clock cycle to execute thus there's always a physical limit to how long you can afford to write. Interactive debugging is currently the limitation of GPU hardware. To actually do that the GPU has to be emulated with our CPU which is quite impossible considering that the REF (software rendering) device can never cop up with even obsolete GPU what more to say about emulating shader.

247,IDE for debugging scons ,"I have a project which uses scons and swig. Which IDE I can use for debugging the code? I want to set breakpoints and use ""step over"" ""continue"" .... while watching variable. (Eclipse plugin) worked well for me in the past. Actually the  command you run to perform your build is a Python script -- you can replace it by a similar script within your IDE and launch that for debugging. Having said that -- actually I found the > of that kind of ""internal DSL"" is implemented in Python (which is surely an educational experience but not helpful for solving problems with my build). Thus usually I solve my problems just with adding some print statements to look into this and that variable in the current construction environment while the build script is evaluated. The manpage of SCons has extensive documentation about the various variables you can access in that environment object and in the dependency nodes defined when you add targets. Any Python debugger should be fine.  Visual Studio (trials available): Tobuy the latest Visual Studio google ""Buy Visual Studio"" (as the linkchanges) you can also google for a specific version. Many areavailable on Amazon. PyCharm home:  As an aside if you (or others on your team) want to > debug Django PyCharm Pro is definitely the best for that."
248,Java IDE with GlassFish ,Please recommend some JAVA IDEs comes with GlassFish server. I have tried both Eclipse and Netbeans both are not working consistently I am looking for an IDE to support GlassFish by default without any stressful confgurations. NetBeans 7.3.1 should work out-of-the-box. Are you downloading the Java EE distirbution that includes GlassFish?
249,External IDE for InterSystems Caché ,I want to replace the Caché Studio because it needs to be ran on Windows. Browser based IDE would be most convenient solution for using OS indepedently and mobile.There isn't a browser-based IDE available for Caché programming.  In fact the only alternative to Caché Studio is George James Software's  a commercial Visual Studio extension which allows you to work with ObjectScript code on the file system.  It allows you to export the classes from Cache and work with them as normal files on the file system. However this is for Windows-based systems only so I am not sure if it meets your needs. The XML > the actual source code.  Unfortunately there is no other option besides Studio but Intersystems is certainly working on one.
250,.net - VS 2010 IDE 2GB limit ,"I am using VS 2010 on a win 7 64 bit system with 8 GB of memory. My application is 32 bit. While in the VS 2010 .Net IDE the app shows up in the Windows task manager as ""MyApp.vshost.exe *32"" while the VS IDE itself shows up as ""devenv.exe *32"".  I checked and it appears that the VS 2010 IDE file (devenv.exe) is complied with the /LargeAddressAware flag.  However when debugging large models the IDE fails with an Out of memory exception. In the Windows Task manager the ""MyApp.vshost.exe *32"" process indicates about 1400 MB of memory usage (while the ""devenv.exe *32"" process is well under 500 MB). Is it possible to set the ""MyApp.vshost.exe *32"" process to be /LargeAddressAware in order to avoid this out of memory situation? If so how can this be done in the IDE. While setting the final application binary to be /LargeAddressAware would work I still need to be able to debug the app in the IDE with these type of large models. I should also note that my app has a deep object hierarchy with many collections that together required a lot of memory. However my issue is not related to trying to create say 1 large array that requires greater then 2 GB of memory etc. I should note that I am able to run the same app in the VB6 IDE and not get an out of memory situation as long as the VB6 IDE is made /LargeAddressAware. In the case of VB6 the IDE and the app being debugged are part of the same process (and not split into 2 as is the case with VS 2010.) The VB6 process can be larger then 3 GB without running into out of memory issues. Ultimately my objective is to have my app run completely in 64 bit to access more memory. I am hoping that in such cases the IDE will allow the debugging process to exceed 2 GB without crashing (and certainly more then 1.4 GB as is the current case). However for now while 95% of my app is 64 bit I am calling a legacy COM 32 bit DLL and as such my entire app is forced to still run in 32 bit mode until I replace that DLL.the IDE fails with an Out of memory exception No your program fails with that exception not the IDE.  You'd have to run editbin.exe in a post build event to set the flag: That will > work on the vshost.exe version you'll have to turn off the hosting process.  Project + Properties Debug tab. Some options I can think of: Disable the VSHost process - Do you actually require the  to forcibly set the flag in the .vshost.exe (no idea if that would work though!)"
252,Does RubyMine 2.0 earn its $99 as a Rails IDE? ,"I've seen a lot of blogs talk about RubyMine lately as a best of breed Rails IDE. Currently I am using NetBeans IDE for my Ruby and Rails stuff but I was wondering if anyone here would personally recommend this IDE and reasons why I should fork out $99 for it.I used NetBeans for a while before switching to RubyMine some month ago prior the first release.I can say the IDE is worth the entire price. RubyMine has the best autocomplete support I have ever seen. It's a really clever IDE it can understand most of the Rails ""magics"" including method references by symbols metaprogramming Rails/Ruby convention and so on. Also RubyMine 2.0 introduced i18n support for Rails and having to maintain a couple of Rails apps localized in 5 different languages I must say this is an awesome feature. It supports the latest testing frameworks in the Ruby ecosystem including Shoulda Test::Unit RSpec and Cucumber. Unfortunately it lacks RCov support while I know Netbeans is going to integrate it. A couple of co-workers are still using NetBeans and they often have problem with SVN because Netbeans doesn't auto-refresh the working copy when you update it outside the IDE.RubyMine has an excellent SCM support and ships with SVN CVS and even Git compatibility. I don't want this answer to seems like a RubyMine promo so I encourage you to give it a try for 30days then make a choice. I've tried Netbean RadRails and RubyMine. In my personal opinion it's well worth the money and I heartily agree with weppos. Your best bet it to try the evaluation version for a while and make your own mind up. I find IDE preferences are very subjective the only real way to know if it's any good is to try it for yourself. it is a little buggy and a big resource eater but has the better ""intellisense"" refactoring and complementary areas support (haml) i ever seen for ruby/rails. it's appearance under mac os x is lame and is much less usable (in terms of UI usability) than any other ide. i guess that in the next major versions it will become the ruby/rails killer-ide. i would wait to buy it as i see it as an immature project right now. Suffice to say that Rubymine (2.5 EAP version) is the first IDE I actually like. Having usedto excellence of developing Rails apps in OS X with TexMate when I switched the job and was forced to get along without OS X I was quite satisfied to find Rubymine. A veteran Emacs user (over 10 years) and recent Vim convert (gotta love the extremely powerful command system and short key bindings) I soon found that either the file navigation cucumber editing or refactoring support was quite lacking in those. With Rubymine I get TextMate-style file navigation which is just awesome the only IDE which actually has a type inferencing engine and is able to capture many run-time errors during the editing phase plus all the features I ever used in Rails projects. Yes I'm going to buy the software when they release 3.0 or so and I don't know if I'll use TextMate in the future when I get again access to OS X. They say the OS X support is very good in Rubymine EAP versions but what's nice that you can have that for every other OS as well. Apologies for answering in short. I'll add that debugging via RubyMine is very convenient. Just set a breakpoint and  try to hit the point.  You can see all of your vars set watches and investigate objects right in the debug console. I'd highly recommend it to any Ruby developer. To me there are 3 big advantages in RubyMine that other free or cheap editors/IDE's don't have (notably TextMate and Ruby VIM): I use it and as of right now don't think it's quite worth it - if you like working with a full IDE RadRails is as good (though in different ways) and free. I admit I haven't got all the keyboard shortcuts in RubyMine down so I'm not as productive with it as I hope to be but I find myself doing stuff at the command line more than I think should be necessary with a 'real' IDE. It's been pretty stable for me (on linux) the source control integration is good and it's not as slow as it used to be (though I still end up in vim at times if I don't want to load it). I'm hoping a 'plugin' ecology will develop around it. Overall it's a pretty good product but not (yet?) worth the $99 over RadRails (haven't used NetBeans) I've used Netbeans for a while(1+ year) now. and have tried RadRails too. but i choose RubyMine cause: all in all i think if you take some time to learn its key mappings you can be very productive with it. you wouldn't need to use a shell at all(well sometimes you might need to but...you get the idea). just my 2 cents I've been using Rubymine to develop Rails apps for a while now. There was a point a few months ago when I would have been hesitant to recommend paying for it.However the rate at which it has been improving and adding new features is really impressive.If you're doing BDD (with Cucumber) then it's worth buying just for the step completion and navigation. Also the features that have come from IntelliJ like Javascript HTML CSS VCS support etc are excellent.    I am a former NetBeans user.  I LOVE RubyMine!  It has excellent rvm git Rspec and cucumber integration all of which are in my stack.  Go with it.  You won't be sorry. I used both Redmine and Textmate but I tend to spend more time coding in textmate. It's a matter of preference whatever gets the job done quicker is the best tool in my opinion. Good Luck @johnrlive I love how ""project aware"" RubyMine is. Coming from ST2 (which is still use daily) it's hard not to miss the elegance of an editor like ST2 but working on large scale projects with versioning RubyMine is the IDE of choice for me. I just wish the would improve the editor and UI.  I just started to explore the IDE concept being a happy TextMate programmer until just a couple days ago. But now that I've played with both NetBeans and RubyMine I gotta say RubyMine rocks. NetBeans is cool for the price but it's slow slow slow. Sometimes windows will lock up for long periods of time while something is apparently ""thinking"" - of what I can't imagine. On the other hand even as a fairly novice Ruby programmer I was able to get RubyMine conversing with Git and AutoTest within a few minutes -- in short I got up and running and back to programming pretty quickly. On the flip side I still haven't figured out how to get it to work with Heroku or Growl but I'm still pretty new at it. I would say depends on what your looking for. Netbeans is definitely a very capable and sufficient IDE. Rubymine shines in its autocompletion and really easy Git integration. If you have a lot of money to spare I would say ruby mine is the way to go. However in my case as I am a broke college student Netbeans and/or text mate does the job fine. Spending an additional minute on git outside of netbeans and using my extra monitor for documentation has worked well for me thus far. "
254,c++ - Multiplatform IDE ,I recently realized I'm making it unnecessarily hard on myself to use 4 different IDEs for every combination of (develop on Windows develop on Linux)x(program runs on ARM program runs on local x86 PC).Currently every time I switch between an ARM project and a x86 project (often a console app to pre-calculate lookup tables for the ARM project) I switch between IDEs. If I already have  talks about building multiple cross-compilers. But I'm missing the next step: Once I have a few cross-compilers built how do I hook an IDE up to them?)You can switch toolchain configurations within Eclipse based on targets or projects. There's no need to switch IDEs it's just a matter of associating toolchains correctly.

If you want cross-platform development I agree with whoever mentions Qt. It's a really great reliable (depends on your requirements of course) and flexible cross-platform framework. Good luck! Have you considered Vim.   Not exactly an IDE but you could easily put versions on one USB stick to allow you to run anywhere.   For some things I like Eclipse but it is only portable in your sense if Java is installed on the host machine.   The other big problem with Eclipse is that it is fairly machine demanding and in my opinion requires a fast SMP machine to work well.    Frankly though I don't use Eclipse for any of the ""C"" languages right now.     A slightly tougher choice might be EMACS again using the same approach as with Vim.  That is putting multiple copies for your different target machines on a USB stick. In the end I have to second something else suggested that is the best portable IDE is a laptop.    For example you can have several very good IDEs installed on a Mac and easily transfer files to a target machine.  Being Unix it is fairly easy to install the GCC or LLVM of your choice even cross compilers.  The big problem with a USB dongle approach is that you never can be sure of having everything you need there.        Xemacs.  If you want something that you can keep on a flash drive with a ton of other tools.  It isn't full features but sure is a step up for writing software than vim.  "
259,emacs - Which IDE are CLISP Programmers using? ,I noticed how SLIME (lisp development package for Emacs) does not come with a frame-source-location function for CLISP so you can't automagically jump to a source location when inside the debugger. Given that I figured CLISP users must be using some other IDE (though I guess IDE is a little bit misleading here maybe they're just using a different Emacs package). So what IDE/Emacs package are CLISP programmers using?I think Emacs and SLIME is still what those people use.
261,debugging - Android Studio IDE: Break on Exception ,"It seems my Android Studio does not want to break on any exception by default. Enabling break on ""Any Exception"" starts breaking within actual JDE libraries. Is there any way to force it to break only on exceptions within my code only? Coming from Visual Studio universe looking for the default VS debug behavior here. and set it to this: Add to the exclusion list in the condition any other non-exceptional exceptions you encounter. (BTW using  is a way of effectively getting a second ""Any exception"" entry.)"
266,c++ - IDE Font spacing problems ,I have been developing programs for a couple years now in Java and more recently C++.  Everything was going great until a couple months ago the font I was using in my editor suddenly got huge spaces between each letter making it almost unreadable.  For Java I used NetBeans IDE.  Now in my code I used the Papyrus font that I modified to be monospaced.  Gave my comments the hand written look while still being usable. A few months ago my comment spacing all of a sudden looked like it had a space between every character.  Figuring it was my fault when I modified the font I simply changed to a different font.  worked fine if a little less fun. Now as I am taking classes in C++ my instructor recommended Dev C++ IDE.  I know it is old but it is what I was told to use.  Now I am getting the same problem here only with all fonts.  Anyone know how to fix this? Screenshot: .This is what it Should look like:I had the same problem try changing your font family to 
269,php - IDE issue or genuine error? ,My IDE (PHP Designer 8) flags (in red) the above function return line that gets the first value from the database however when I run it there are no errors thrown and it produces the expected results (see below). If I remove the [0] then the flag disappears.  Is this truly a syntax error or an IDE issue?  Looks like an IDE issue. It appears that the IDE does not recognize that results() is returning a list. I've noticed that IDEs will often flag this kind of syntax (when you are offsetting into an anonymous temporary variable). If you want to get rid of the warning try assigning the result to a local variable.
271,java - How to detect that code is running inside eclipse IDE ,"How to  detect that code is running inside eclipse IDEI am not aware of a generic way to get this kind of information. One suggestion: When you start a Java program (or a web server) inside Tomcat simply add an argument that will indicate that this program is launched by Eclipse. You can do that by opening the ""Open Run Dialog"" (""Run"" menu) then select your type of application and add in the ""Arguments"" tab a  dir whereas most of your end users will be running the app from a JAR. You may try something like this:"
273,editor/ide for node.js development ,Which IDE or Editor do you use for node.js Development on Windows or Linux? Currently I only know 2 IDE-Extensions: both are in a pretty early Development-Stage so I wondered are there  more Alternatives out there? Or is it common to use an Editor with Syntax-Highlighting for Node.js Development? from Jetbrains is very good and allows debugging with node.js. Every IDE which supports JavaScript highlighting will do the job. I personally use Sublime Text. While you work on node apps you have to monitor their output. I just place the console in my second monitor but if you use only one you may need to setup a build process.
274,"How to solve a RubyMine ""'ruby-debug-ide' isn't installed"" error ",I get the error: but all gems were successfuly installed: I can run 'rdebug-ide' manually: But when I start debugging RubyMine asks to install the ruby-debug-ide gem. Why? And after installation I get: I'm running Mac OS X 10.11.3.Here's the actual command that worked for me: I started getting this after upgrading from 2017.x to 2018.1. In my case it seems that RubyMine needed a newer version but its error message implied it couldn't find any version and failed to install it. I think it was trying to install it with a different SDK. Manually installing the latest  (global/default) it is using. Check out where these required gems are installed and make sure RubyMine is using that gemset where these are installed successfully. I fixed this after viewing the responses here:  The solution at the bottom suggested 'removing all my gems. removing ruby. cleaning up directories and rvm. removing ruby mine then reinstalling everything' I started with the easiest of these which was to reinstall rubymine. That solved it for me.  I have faced this issue too with Rubymine 8 rvm 1.29.1 and Ruby version 2.3.3 And upgrading the Rubymine version from Rubymine 8 to Rubymine 2016.3 or latest resolves the issue for me. Check ruby  version is same to which you have installed.With those all doneyou will be able to debug ruby. Please check x286 vs 64 version both Ruby and Rmine version. I had this problem runnin x86 rubyMine on 64 ruby A combination of matching the host ide ruby version with the remote SDK version worked for me but required a few additional steps.  I too am running mac os as my host (running mohave) NOTE: I had to re-install the bundler gem on both host and remote host to get the gem manager to install things auto-majically. NOTE: I also had to set the default RVM on my local host and remote host and unset the previous version as default in the local host preferences. Once I did this I was able to get gems in sync and remote debugger to connect. My solution was to go to Rubymine settings to the available SDKs remove the SDK restart Rubymine and add the SDK again. Since you're using Mac OSX I couldn't provide the same exact answer for you but you can find a similar way of achieving this. I'm using Ubuntu with Vagrant so you may need to adapt it just a little bit. It may asks you one more time to install the gem but then the debug will works for sure.
280,java - Size of splash screen IDE ,For my thesis work I need to create an IDE and I want to create a splash screen for the IDE.So my first question is that I don't know which size for the image I must create for the splash screen.My second question is that probably a lot of different screen resolutions are available in the market and the screen splash might be bigger or smaller for some computers... Is there anything that we could do to solve this ? P.S.: I really liked the splash screen from IntelliJ IDE (15) I want to create something like that as a splash screen. //----------------------------------------------------------------// If you want to scale it in relation to the monitor's resolution I'd first get the height and width with the : Then you can scale an image that you're using for your splashscreen by using this method: Then center it on the screen by calculating the middle and setting your component there: actual implementation is up to you but these are the tools I use and it works fine for me.  Hope this helps!
281,PhpStorm very slow and sluggish on netbook optimize IDE for responsiveness? ,"I recently upgraded from PhpStorm 6 to PhpStorm 7. Delighted to see all the improvements but it runs awfully slow on my low-powered netbook. The delay between typing and seeing text appear is often 5-6 seconds and gets worse as line count increases. It is unusable at this stage. How can I improve the general IDE speed and responsiveness?: I made some changes to increase the responsiveness of the IDE. I'm sure there are more things one could do but I found these to improve the performance to well within usable margins. From most effective to least: These changes brought down both the startup time and significantly increased responsiveness of the IDE in general. Add these to your  file at the bottom: Solid speedup to the point that the editor is now actually usable. I will for the life of me just never understand why people create editors in Java. If you need to speed up PhpStorm right away turn on Power Save mode. (File &gt; Power Save Mode or using ""Hector the Inspector"" icon  in the IDE status bar). This mode turns off on-the-fly code inspectionsThis way you can finish what you have started and later decide what code inspections to deactivate.   The most effective way to speed up new phpstorm version is an experimental feature that is going to be shipped by default in phpstorm 2017.1. Until that you can activate it on jetbrains products (webstorm phpstorm etc.)    Click on Add editor.zero.latency.typing=trueClose and open again the application.   For me the change typing is not laggy anymore.Other tricks didn't helped me or not in a noticeable way. Try removing unnecessary files from your project.I had 3k+ *.html log files inside my project and that slowed down typing terribly when the 'Project' tab was open. (Hiding the project tab or turning off the PHP Plugin does also speeds up PHPStorm but obviously those are not viable trade-offs.) (I'm using PHPStorm 2016)"
282,angular - Angular2 - how to start and with which IDE ,I have used AngularJS 1.x now for a couple of months. Now I will switch to Angular2 (with TypeScript) and actually I am not sure which IDE to use.It is also not clear for me how to compile the TypeScript Code into JavaScript - actually is this necessary?I have read that Visual Studio Code would be a nice editor for Angular2 projects - is there a TypeScript compiler included? I would be glad for any information in this direction. I was wondering myself which IDE is the best suited for Angular2. I'm a big > (+ Typescript plugin).Better BUT no support for auto import (maybe it has some now ?) and also I had to wait 30s before I get any autocompletion. Then I tried Webstorm as the company I'm currently working at has some licences. It was great and I was really happy for a month. But using an editor that is not free felt ... weird. I wouldn't use it at home for personal projects I couldn't recommend it to other people easily. And honnestly I'm not a super fan of Webstorm interface. So I gave (another) try to  that I didn't find so great when I first tried it few months ago. It has seriously evolved and :- it's simple- it's complete   - Code   - Debugger (remote --&gt; super powerful)   - Git integration   - Plugin store- it has great great Angular2 support- intellisense is really awesome I'm using it since a month and so far I'm really happy and do not feel the need to change. Just to help you start with good plugins here's mine : Angular-cli compiles your Typescript and even your (sccs|sass|less) files. When you want to deploy your app : Will also minimify JS and CSS.  Once you feel more comfortable with Angular2 in general I'd strongly recommend you to learn (more) about- - 
284,Making Source writable from the Delphi IDE ,"Is it possible to make readonly source code (eg. .pas &amp; .dfm) writable from within the Delphi IDE?  The right click option to make files Readonly/Writable within the IDE doesn't change the properties on the file system.  Is there an IDE extension or similar that can achieve this? A way to do this without having to integrate a source control system would be preferable.  I am using Delphi XE and Delphi 6. Thanks! sseThis is how I would do it. Create a new package which will be installed into the IDE at designtime. If you have an existing package handy then you could carry on using it. Make sure the package  clause. Now add the following unit to your package. When you compile and install this package you will now have a new menu item on the File menu which both clears the read-only flag in the input buffer and makes the file writeable. You can call a .bat file from the tools menu.  So you could write a .bat file to do the work for  you and call it with $EDNAME as the parameter.Your .bat file should see the filename as %1.  Then you'd need a little bit of logic to change the read-only flag (attrib command?) and then see if there is a .dfm and do that one as well. You could also (obviously) make a Delphi command-line app to do this if you're not comfortable with .bat files.   This idea inspired by this article that talks about how to use a .bat file to integrate SVN commands with the Delphi tools menu: Another idea: Just add an option to the tools menu: ""open command prompt here"". It lets you do all sorts of things from the command line such as running the attrib command. Add a new entry to the Tools menu and use these settings: Also make yourself an ""Open Folder Here"" entry:"
285,What IronPython IDE should I use? ,"This question probably looks a lot like  that integrates with Visual Studio.  It was a logical choice for me because I use Visual Studio when I work with C#. One of the problem I have with IronPython Studio is that I cannot change the default colors.  I have a dark gray background color and black Python code doesn't look very good on that background.  I looked in Environment-&gt;Fonts and Colors in Option dialog but couldn't find the option to change IronPython colors.  Let it be my side question:How to change default colors in integrated IronPython Studio? I heard about SharpDevelop but I don't know if it's going to be a big improvement of IronPython Studio.  I decided to ask you before I'll try it. So please could you please let me know of pros and cons of your favorite IronPython IDE.  Don't tell me ""I use XYZ IDE and love it"".

286,visual studio - IDE placement on dual monitors ,"What IDE placement (output errors threads watch etc..) do you use (coding/debugging) in Visual Studio on Dual Monitors?Well slightly off topic I sit in front of 5 monitors two for each machine Machine A Machine B Machine C I have them configured like so - Left: The IDE with as large an editor window as possible.Right: Everything else. I always keep the IDE in the left monitor and save the right monitor for the app when running in debug mode.  If you are setting breakpoints in message handlers for events that fire when a window is redrawn you can get into some irritating event loops when your IDE pops up and covers your app (likewise when you expose the app again). Outside of that it really depends on which windows I need at the moment (call stack output memory etc.). We have some developers at our studio that use widescreen monitors turned vertical for more screen real-estate for their code.  I think that you have to have driver support for this mode.  For example the nVidia control panel will support rotation of monitors to accomplish what I've described. You lose the horizontal in favor of the vertical but many programmers here really like that mode. Properties window takes up 2/3 width of top half of monitor 2. Output/Error List/Pending Changes in a tab strip ~100% of lower half of monitor 2. Everything else is on monitor 1. I keep my IDE in my main monitor and put the properties output etc. tool windows grouped together detached on my secondary monitor. If I need to use the IDE and the secondary monitor at the same time (usually I don't just because of the type of apps I've been working on currently) then I'll switch to having the tool windows re-docked and set to auto-hide (which also works pretty well when using remote desktop). It depends on the monitors I have my laptop on the left due to the limitations of my desk so I have got used to having my IDE on the decent monitor on the right.  I would say the IDE should be the monitor easier to see my right monitor is more centered than the left laptop monitor I use a Mac therefore my Windows Vista (and XP) is virtualized in a VMWare or Parallels virtual machine. Both programs contain bugs when using multiple monitors and Unity/Coherence mode (that is make the windows invisible and only see the running programs).  Only the latest VMWare 2.0 RC released a few days ago is capable of this. (not without some glitches).  I use a Macbook Pro and an external 22'' display. The ""Main"" display is the external (22 &gt; 15) ;) So the OS X menu bar dock etc. is there. The Macbook Pro internal display is the small secondary display in my case sitting left of the big screen.  When I use VStudio I have the main VS display in the main display maximized. And the Solution Explorer Properties Classes and a few other toolbars using the left smaller screen.  All I see is Code and some toolbars but mainly all code. When I debug the floating tools disappear and others appear where the code is (the code window becomes a little bit smaller to accomodate this). No more floating stuff as the application runs in the Macbook Pro smaller display while I keep seeing the code/values/etc in the visual studio big screen. It's a nice way to work. I'd recommend it anytime. There are people that think that multiple displays not always means better productivity; solutions like ""virtual desktops"" are nice but cannot replace the speed of your eye moving from screen 1 to screen 2 to quickly glance at a property. I've tried Spaces on the mac and it doesn't come close. At least for programming. I keep everything in the left monitor and my DB/Firefox in the right hand one.  Mainly because i switch dev between one monitor and two monitors depending where I am and I dont want to have to get used to two layout configurations for using VS.  On my left the main screen (20"") with the IDE and a smaller one (15"") with Chrome PDFs and apps at my right :)"
287,c# - Looking for an online IDE ,I have been looking for a fairly decent online IDE that does well with both c# and java I have tried Cloud9IDE CodeRun and Amy Editor.  I really had liked CodeRun until i found that it was impossible for me to add another file into the same project unless i was just doing it wrong which is possible.  Amy Editor was very promising also until i couldn't figure out how to create a new project or compile the sample code i had written.  If anyone knows how to use these editors or of any other good online IDE environments then I'm game to learn.Why not run your IDE somewhere on a machine and connect to it remotely? You can even install your own Virtual Desktop on Amazon EC2 for example so you don't have to run the machine yourself. For an idea on how to do this see ?

I would like to help my clients do acceptance testing by providing them with a suite of tests that use some smarts to create random (or at least pseudo-random) values for the database. One of the issues with my Selenium IDE tests at the moment is that they have predefined values - which makes some types of testing problematic.  First off the Selenium IDE is rather limited you should consider switching to Selenium RC which can be driven by Java or Perl or Ruby or some other languages. Using just Selenium IDE you can embed JavaScript expressions to derive command parameters.You should be able to type a random number into a text field for example:  You can define helper functions in a file called ""user-extensions.js"". See the . >You can mix literals and random numbers like this: Gmail makes possible that automatically everything that use aliases for example  Multiplying *11111 to give you more random values than 1 to 9 (in Thilo example) You can add user exentions.js to get the random values . Copy the below code and save it as .js extension (randomgenerator.js) and add it to the Selenium core extensions (SeleniumIDE--&gt;Options---&gt;general tab) Way to use  Above code generates 6 charactes string and it assign to the variable x Code in HTML format looks like below: Here's a one-line solution to generating a random string of letters in JS: Useful for pasting into Selenium IDE.

313,IDE for css.less files dreamweaver ,"I'm using lesscss the 'framework/compiler' for css. My IDE dreamweaver does not recognize  as CSS. So no niceties such as error checking or code completion there. Is there anything I can do about that? Dreamweaver can be configured to recognize ""new"" filetypes and treat them as editable under preferences.  You can also edit some config files to help DreamWeaver figure out how to treat the files so it does code highlighting etc. though in my experience it does not always work as you would expect.  On the other hand can lesscss be configured to output .css files? Here's an Adobe article on getting Dreamweaver to add new file types. that might be of help Try giving the extension: less.css to your css file.Example: styles.less.css. This worked for me but I still need a base stylesheet such as: styles.css. Also You can compile .less files to .css directly from within Dreamweaver using a free (Donation-ware) plugin:   Dreamweaver has a very hard time with LESS in my experience. It doesn't properly handle nesting and will color those as though they are syntax errors. However it is mostly workable since the auto-complete does at least still work and the overall coloring is okay on everything except nested items. (at least for me) Also the extensions that are referenced above do not work on mac.  If you are having trouble getting DW to be able to open and color code LESS at all try this--  For Mac users there are TWO configuration folders (at least for DW5.5). Two sets of identical files FOUR in total files have to be changed: ~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS5.5/en_US/Configuration/DocumentTypes/MMDocumentTypes.xml~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS5.5/en_US/Configuration/Extensions.txt Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.5/Configuration/DocumentTypes/MMDocumentTypes.xmlAdobe Dreamweaver CS5.5/Configuration/Extensions.txt And this technote tells you what exactly to change in those files:  and for those on mac this little app works GREAT. All it does is watch your less files and automatically save them to css on save. This actually does all that and more as CSS and less have a little different syntax specially when it comes to nesting rules inside one another."

317,python - Does Django need an IDE? ,"My company is evaluating the possibility of developing a specialized IDE for Django.  So we would like to ask Django users:  Do you feel the need for a specialized IDE for Django? Would you be willing to pay for it or would you only consider free a open-source product?  What Django-specific features are you missing currently in your development tools?It's great that your company wants to contribute to the community but I have to say that I don't see what a 'Django IDE' would achieve. There are already plugins for all the main editors and IDEs to support Django - from Vim to TextMate to NetBeans - and these provide syntax highlighting indentation shortcuts and snippets for both Python source and Django templates. These can always do with more work of course so perhaps your efforts would be best focused on improving one of these. I would pay a reasonable amount for a Django-tailored IDE or plug-in. I don't know what I mean by reasonable but maye it helps to know that I would not pay more than $75 and I would only pay the $75 if the tool was really awesome. Now Django specific features: If I can think of anything else I will edit the answer. Good luck in designing your product! I am using Komodo Edit and it's very good. There is a lot of good open-sources product so i don't think that I would buy a commercial product.  Maybe a very good and easy-to-use debugger would make me change my mind.  I hope it helps.  You'll likely want an IDE that will provide you with the ability to do source-level debugging of your accompanying Python code. Without it your productivity will really be below what it could be. I use  but vice-versa. yes I will donate. I would definitely pay or donate for a pure Django IDE even tho there are already some existing plugins I feel something is always ""floating"". "

Does anybody know of a way to use the IDE with Drupal or if not what do you suggest I do?You can in the same way that you can use selenium on just about any web page.  From what I can see (though I haven’t' used it) the selenium module seems to be more about using Drupal to store and run selenium tests which is useful but will not explicitly test your Drupal site. (>) Drupal comes with it's own testing framework which uses  This is nice because you can then do continuous integration testing by using Drush to script the running of your tests. The question is what do you want to achieve? The Firefox &amp; Selenium IDE (FF extension) combination works great with Drupal for functional testing. It also works great if you want to capture some Drupal configuration settings (that you'd like to play back e.g. in another environment) but there are better ways - Patterns and Strongarm modules - to achieve that. A couple of tips &amp; tricks: while capturing clicks be careful with timings (between clicks) sometimes you need to add ""pause"" lines to your test case for HTML form checkboxes Selenium often records the ""click"" action instead of the much safer ""check"" or ""uncheck"" action (this is important if you run your test case several times against the same page / form) if your page reloads when you click a certain link use ""clickAndWait"" instead of the simple ""click"" action use ""verifyTextPresent"" often especially if you're running your tests ""blindly"" using Selenium RC. I use selenium IDE all the time. It's an awesome tool for productivity and communication.  But Drupal's Simpletest framework has a built in browser for user testing. So you probably won't that module. See:."
327,MacOS MongoDB IDE ,I am new in MongoDB and have been working with Oracle and SQL Server that have some easy to install and easy to use IDE. I know that Mongo already have some for windows but is there any MongoDB IDE for MacOS?  is pretty good. Although their shell version is a little behind. Its ok for querying and stuff not so great for admin tasks like adding/managing users. 
329,IDE integration with GIT ,We're considering migrating from CVS to GIT. Our whole development process is centered around IntelliJ and the plugin we've found (GIT4idea) is severely lacking. Essential features like global history logs or diff changes are completely missing. Are there any other alternatives in IntelliJ land?

333,c# - selfhosted WebAPI runs in IDE but not outside of IDE ,"I have a selfhosted WebAPI built into a console app.  When I run it via the VisualStudio IDE everything works fine.  I have a client app that connects and interacts with the WebAPI app just fine.  However if I run my WebAPI app outside of the IDE by just double clicking the EXE my client app is unable to connect to it at all.  I do not get any real useful error information either there are two InnerExceptions in the client (on the PostAsXmlAsync call).  One says ""Unable to connect to remote server"" and the 2nd is ""An error occurred while sending the request"". Normally I'd troubleshoot and debug this myself if it were a consistent error.  But the key element here is if I run this all via the VisualStudio IDE everything works as expected. Can anyone provide some suggestions on what I should be looking at/for?  Thanx!1) If all you are doing is accessing the self host locally you can set the following configuration option: With that you don't have to run the process with elevated privileges (again if you want to access it locally). 2) Another option is to reserve a specific port for the specific user: That also allows you to run self host not as admin as long as the process is started for a user for whom the port has been reserved. 3) Finally the last option is to just run it as admin."

336,php - Web based IDE solution ,"What I want to do is to work on my projects from ""everywhere"" with internet connection I tried followings: Tried to connect from my office to main PC with remote desktop apps like: Team Viewer etc.. It's very slow and boring. (Seeing what I typed after 2-3 second delay and it's really annoying) Carrying laptop with myself also not good idea. (It's weight about 4-5 kg.) Flash drive also not good idea... All my projects together is about 20-30 GB. The only comfortable way for me is:  (something like Netbeans I mean in-built project managementetc.. BUT web based).  I was looking for Web based IDE which supports PHP HTML JS and other various languages. My main PC is always connected to internet. So if there is any good open source (or free) solution I can serve this IDE either from my webhosting account or directly from my PC. (For ex. this service  is exactly what I need. But there are some problems: 1 its paid. 2 I don't want to host my projects in third party servers. I need something like that but want to instal such system on my own servers ) What do you think about this/what's your suggestion? Thx in advance...You should check out Codiad -  - you can host it on your own server configure it to do what you need and access it anywhere. If you want to work on a project from anywhere then you may want to look at using a decentralised version control system like Git instead. Advantages is you can work on any machine with Git and an IDE or text editor and not relying on a third-party web-based service that can do anything with your data or may disappear overnight. As an alternative way of solving the problem: All my projects are hosted on GitHub. I split my work between three computers. When I sit down to work on a project I run  and any changes I’ve made on the others get pulled down. You won’t have to re-sync all 20GB of data just the bits that you’ve changed. Then you can continue to work using native OS applications. You can install Git for free on your own server.  though. I use it a lot and while there's somewhat of a learning curve to it you can use it anywhere there's a console (linux or putty on windows) and I think it has all of the features you've mentioned."

347,python - Markdown in Spyder IDE ,I was experimenting in the Spyder IDE and learned that it is possible to define cells using the  separator. Now I couldn't find it but is it possible to use markdown like in a Jupyter notebook?No. As far as I know Spyder IDE has no markdown implemented as Jypter notebook even if it is connecting to a Jupyer notebook instance locally. I would suggest you to use Jupyter notebook for coding and annotation if you need such a thing. Spyder is just a IDE. But if you want to edit Jupyter notebook in a IDE just take a look at PyCharm IDE.

I was able to dowload it and Installed it succesfully from the link above though). further   : . IIRC Visual Studio will give you debugging if you assemble with /debug.  I think MS had a demo or sample of some VS plugin that helped a bit with IL. I'm not sure what it was named or if it was released.
355,An alternative IDE for Sybase Powerbuilder ,"Does anyone know of an alternative IDE for Sybase Powerbuilder?  It feels pretty clunky after working with VS2008 and Eclipse. If not has anyone successfully worked with this language outside the IDE? I'm not against using a simple text editor but I find edit-import-regenerate-test-export-edit is clunkier than simply using the Powerbuilder editor. To date the only tools I have had any success with are: EDIT: I added a bounty to draw some wider attention to the question.  It would be a very nice thing to have if it exists. EDIT: Well that was disappointing.  The bounty apparently did not cause even 1 new person to look at the question.None that I'm aware of although you could probably use a source control tool edit in your source control repository and Get Latest Version from the PB IDE to shorten your text editor cycle. Be warned that there are hacks required to edit anything over 128 ASCII. (My guess is that this is to allow everything Unicode to be source controlled in the most restrictive source control tools.) As Paul said PB12 is coming with based on the Visual Studio shell and will include things like collapsible code blocks Intellisense etc.... However for PB12 this will only be used for WPF targets and a few .NET-type targets (like assemblies) last I heard. Win32 targets will continue to use the ""classic"" IDE. Good luck Terry. P.S. Thanks for the PBL Peeper compliment. The PowerBuilder IDE  clunky but I don't think developing completely outside the PowerBuilder IDE is a good idea.  I think there are just too many dependencies right now. However the IDE for PowerBuilder 12 will be built using Microsoft's Visual Studio Isolated Shell so it ought to be much better when that is released.  Also I believe they'll be doing away with the PBL format which ought to make source control much easier to work with. Certainly something to watch. What I do is right-click the object and edit source. Then I copy the text and paste it into Notepad++ to edit. I copy and paste back to PowerBuilder then I can save and see any errors. I've got a fairly decent User Defined Language for PowerScript if anyone's interested. Added:Please be aware that I've seen the PB Source editor corrupt DataWindows. They were all large DataWindows. To be safe always export DataWindows to edit. One tool that will most probably make your PB experience way better is Visual Expert which provides a good source browser. Such a tool should have been integrated into the PB IDE a long time ago IMHO. Only problem is that it's not free as opposed to the other tools you mention. Regarding using external source editors you can probably take advantage of OrcaScript which is a scripting language that lets you perform actions such as export and import of PB objects from outside of the IDE. It will require some effort but you can setup a basic dev env using batch files with ORCA scripts and some additional external tools. However this setup will lack any visual editing capabilities which means no (feasible) GUI or DW work. If you're mostly into NVOs it could work. But then if that's the case why use PB in the first place?... I too have heard PB12's use of VS will be limited to some .NET stuff which will probably benefit only a very small portion of the PB programmers community. I'm afraid the rest of us are stuck with the awful IDE for years to come. Other than exporting the source and editing it I don't know of another IDE for PB. One problem you may have is that the exported source contains a lot of syntax that is not documented in the manuals.  The PB IDE generates this code but there is no support for creating it by hand.  I think you are stuck with the PB IDE In my modest five Years of experiences starting with Powerbuilder 5/6 now using PB 10 I tempt to : ... i came to the conclusion that there will be no chance in improving Powerbuilder to an state-of-the-art language In my philosophy - I obtained during those years - I distinguish between two types of OOP-oriented languages: ...In memory of the good old Unix(Solaris)/C++ days... I was researching a replacement solution that would be similar to PowerBuilder and I came across two that caught my eye. The first was 'React Studio'  . Still researching but I currently have React Studio at the top of our list."

Have you come across any python IDE with the above two features? of course the IDE need to have the essential features:Why not watch the great  for all my Python projects for the past 8 months and i definitely love it.

358,Is anyone using a firefox XUL IDE? ,I'm not interested in Firebug a XUL debugger or a JavaScript editor but a true WYSIWYG IDE for XUL form design.Here is a MozillaWiki page with 's XUL layout editor. I recall that it is very complete and easy to use and it comes with lots of examples of every single XUL element put in multiple layout scenarios. I believe you need a nightly build or a dev release of it which you can easily get from the website. The good thing is that besides the editor it comes with some other fancy and very useful XUL developer tools. And of course it is a great iTunes replacement ;) I think no Wysiwyg IDE available for Xulbut there is  it may help you

370,Good C++ Debugging/IDE Environment for Linux? ,I have a friend who is trying to make the switch to Linux but is hung up on the apparent lack of debugging/IDE environments for C++ especially as they relate to template programming. He has been using visual studio for years and is maybe a little spoiled by their awesome IDE. Does anyone have any good suggestions for an environment where he can under Linux develop and debug with all of the usual things (Breakpoints line highlighting for compilation errors step in/over/out/etc etc) that he's accustomed to? Thanks!Although many people think of it as a Java IDE he could try  is very nice too but you will need a very good computer. In my opinion the best choice iss gcc gdb and ViM or Gedit. My buddies from work use Eclipse + Scons they also use Valgrind(spelling?) for tracking memory leaks and such. Many of the IDE features you listed were debugger features.  The ddd (Data Display Debugger) debugger is quite a nice GUI wrapper for gdb allowing graphical representation of data structures a non-crappy source listing window (ie. unlike the l command of gdb where you don't get context) and also allows you to use any and all native gdb commands directly if desired. Have a look at CodeLite. It's available for Ubuntu and Fedora out of the box and even for Windows and Mac. So you can have the same IDE on different platforms. We tried Eclipse and NetBeans but left them due to their huge CPU and memory usage. We have a development server and all the developers connect to it via RDC. Thats why these IDEs miserably failed in our model. So we looked for some native IDE. Found CodeBlocks to be very good and super fast. We sort of settled on it but later found CodeLite and liked it better than CodeBlocks.

372,What is a best IDE for oracle? ,"I Work on a ORACLE 8.0.I know how to run oracle SQL command's in SQLPLUS.I searched to find a IDE such as SQL Server Management Studio but couldn't find it.  what is best IDE for ORACLE?thanks ""Best"" is a matter of opinion - available environments include: Wow.  Oracle 8.0 has been obsolete for almost 15 years.  That's an ancient version of the database.  Are you sure you're really using something that old?  That definitely complicates things because it means that any vaguely recent version of the Oracle client won't be able to connect to the database so you're eliminating the vast majority of tools. If you're really stuck with an ancient version of Oracle the old Java based Enterprise Manager application that shipped as a part of the Oracle client is the closest thing to SQL Server Management Studio.  I don't know if that was available way back in Oracle 8.0 but the version that shipped with the 8.1.7 Oracle client should connect to an Oracle 8.0 database.  Of course Oracle no longer makes either the 8.0 or 8.1.7 Oracle client available for download and you'd need to have a pretty old version of the operating system to be able to install something that old.  If you still have a support agreement (though that seems unlikely since you haven't upgraded Oracle in my working lifetime) you might be able to open a support request and get Oracle to send you a CD for desupported versions of the database or client."

393,Decent JavaScript IDE ,What is a decent IDE for developing JavaScript I'll be writing both client side stuff and writing for Rhino. Ideally It needs to run on Mac OSX although something that runs on Windows too would be nice.  Having had a play with both js2 and Aptana I think I'll be continuing to use Aptana. Mainly because I find emacs a bit hard to get my head round although I did think that the error hi-lighting in js2 was better than that in Aptana. I'm still looking for a way to visually debug my js code that is running atop Rhino...Aptana IDE absolutely. Stable great syntax support for all the major javascript libraries very good css and html editors. Also good support for php air ruby on rails and iPhone app development (I never tested this one). Aptana can also connect to remote site via ftp (sftp in the pro edition) and to svn and cvs repositories. It's based on Eclipse so it's not exactly a lightweight application. But it's really really good. You can also use it as an Eclipse plugin if you develop java wab app but when I tested it in this version about 1 year ago it was not stable. Much better to use the standalone version. If you're familiar with Emacs Steve Yegge's  is definitely the best IDE/editor (that I have used) for developing JavaScript. Notable features include live error reporting JavaScript macros and syntax auto-complete for ALL major frameworks!  If you have a very big application written in Javascript there's only IntelliJ Idea. It parses multiple Javascript files and highlights not only syntax errors but undeclared variables and functions allows to jump from function call to function definition and more. I've tried Emacs (because that's my favorite editor) and Komodo and they don't come close. I guess it's the same for Eclipse. Personally I think that superior parsing and navigation abilties of Idea are only required when you're working with crappy undocumented code otherwise I'd happily write the code in Emacs using js2-mode but I'm working with huge poorly documented and buggy framework and it really helps to be able to jump to the source of the function or superclass to check how they work.

It's pretty simple imo.12-18 is more like teenager not a kid I'm sure that they fluent with much more complicated interfaces like facebook :) The Python IDLE has most of these features (never used the debugger before so I don't know how good it is). It's probably the most minimalist Python IDE out there.

405,smalltalk - alternative IDE for squeak/pharo ,"I've been using smalltalk for a while now and I love the language and the concept. What I just hate is the System browser. This tool doesn't even resemble a modern IDE. How am I supposed to code without tabs outlines and handy shortcuts? I often find myself implementing a selector and noticing that it would be nice to isolate a piece of code in a separate (private) selector just for readability shake but I don't. Because it takes like 5 mouse clicks and I have to navigate away from the selector I am working at and navigate back to it. Oh wait I can't! Because it has syntax errors because I haven't finished it yet! Kills me. And I don't have a 24 inch display to open 3 browsers. Sorry for a little rant. My question is is there a real IDE (Eclipse Net.Beans VS) for smalltalk? Maybe for some commercial version of smalltalk?Historically the real ""IDE"" is the Smalltalk one and one could claim that the others are just an adaptation to the limits of traditional textual programming languages (not rethorical just check out the evolution of typical development environment UIs and how they are adding features that exists in Smalltalk from the very beggining like the senders and references in VS). Just a side note: actually more than 2000 open-source projects in the  has an IDE called CodeMonkey for writing Smalltalk applications.  It's not specifically for Squeak and instead uses their own smalltalk implementation but it may be worth looking into.  Unfortunately it's only available in their SVN repository so it's a pain to compile and install."

At Michael's suggestion I tried the sideflow.js user extension instead. With sideflow.js I have tried the following expressions: All throw the same error: But the following expressions work fine: It seems there is an issue around the == operator...Selenium IDE doesn't provide a way to act on a value (if else) you will need to run WebDriver and use the programming language to provide that functionality.  However in IDE you can stop the test if the values are not equal by using any of the  and IDE will flag the evaluation depending on the result and the test will continue as normal. if you just need to compare two variables then use command verifyExpression storeValue|id=id1|var1 storeValue|id=id2|var2 verifyExpression|${var1}|${var1} if two variables matches then no error will throw if not error will throw. Thank you Note the single quotes around both the variable and the text.  This took me a while also.Not sure however if you need to use the javascript piece how it needs to be formatted. I believe runscript has to be used after each store variable request.  I may be wrong but it seems to me this is what actually triggers the call to the sideflow.js to execute its functions.  I'm inferring this from my own trial and errors attempting to solve my issues.For integers the following code worked for me.  with == it evaulated true and went to the correct label.
411,spring - Struts1 with IntelliJ IDE ,I have developed struts1 application with Eclipse. I had to change my IDE into IntelliJ. I need to develop a new application integrating struts1 and Spring. I found some interesting tutorials from  and Since above examples were developed using Eclipse IDE I might wonder is there is any better (easy) way of doing it using Intellij .  Please mentioned any tutorials or better way to doing this.What did you try? I got Spring working in IntelliJ using Maven and copying other . I hope that also can work for you. Configure Maven for IntelliJ if you can get spring working with IntelliJ try make it work from the command prompt with maven + your app server (I can recommend jetty) and then you can open the Spring/Maven project in IntelliJ and it will work.

418,Lightweight Java IDE that Maintains Indentation? ,"Whenever I am debugging a java program I have to have the code indented! And I hate to manually indent code one by one (using Tab). I would really like a lightweight Java IDE that automatically indents ALL your code at a push of a button. A good example is ""Ready To Program"" Java IDE but the downside to this IDE is that it is not compatible with JDK 1.5+  Are there any suggestions on such a Java IDE? to properly format/indent your Java code.  It's even got a handy shortcut:  Edit: Oh yeah Netbeans is great but not really lightweight... In the good old days I used to use emacs as an ""IDE"" for Java development.  It has excellent support for code indentation and formatting. Coding Java in NPP must be similar experience to shaving yourself with blunt stone and using vodka instead of aftershave. It may look manly but there's no reason. It's XXI century. Intellij will run on any reasonable PC same with NetBeans and Eclipse. Those features are no-brainer for me along with about hundred of others. Build in debugger with ability to execute any piece of code or checking variable state are also necessary. I know that most of debugger may be replaced with good suite of unit tests however sometimes you just need to check something live. And as we are on topic of unit tests even that is possible to simplify with good IDE. Intellij allows you to navigate between class and test class run single test whole class or suite with simple key stroke generate test method from template etc. If you live from writing code then don't do it to yourself and just buy a license or use open version. Life is to short to work on NPP with plugins. Disclaimer: Vim is okay if you have to reconfigure something on live system in order to save a lot of $$$ c's it'll take time to deploy new version. In any other case using advanced notepad is just stupid. Why? For same reason as coding not on decent hardware but on OLPC.  "
419,Delphi IDE begin-end pair indicator ,In Delphi IDE brackets () are easy to match together because the IDE highlights the matching pair when clicked.

423,Delphi IDE Line Length ,In Delphi 7 IDE do the lines need to be a given length? I see a gray line in some Delphi code I'm working with and it looks like ever line ends right before it.It's just a guide to line length. Some people don't like long lines because they can be hard to read on different resolutions or when doing comparisons.  It's called the > groupbox. The margin is a visual assistent. The standard position is 80 characters which defaults to the maximum unscrolled size of many source formatting output media such as the one used here at Stack Overflow. Originally it had something to do with the paper width on (matrix) printers. Maybe it still does.

442,ruby - Rails -- IDE Recommendations ,  I am looking for a good IDE for Ruby on Rails with the following qualifications: Works on a Windows PC (if it doesn't then it's not going to help me) Good auto-completion (for both classes provided by default (or by gem) for ruby and rails as well as for my own user-defined classes). Good syntax highlighter - most IDEs have solid syntax highlighting (I currently use Notepad++ and it does the trick relatively well) but I would really like for the syntax highlighter to detect which language to highlight in for the Rails views (highlight HTML in general JS inside  tags and Ruby inside ERB tags) - Notepad++ doesn't have that capability which makes the views that contain ERB JS and HTML a little difficult to read. Good debugger that runs when I execute my RoR app locally. If you know of any good IDEs out there that meet as many of these qualifications as possible that are relatively cheap that would be great!  If it is totally worth purchasing (i.e. RubyMine looks good but $69 is kind of expensive for an IDE when Notepad++ does work acceptably) then I can stomach the cost.  Thanks in advance!Actually as a Rails enthusiast myself. I strongly recommend Rubymine. Rubymine has a pretty neat debugger and I would say does a decent job of auto-completion. Give it a shot I think you'd like it. If you do end up using it try out   I've been using Netbeans I think Netbeans a good idea.  Eclipse sometime sucks with the different versions of Ruby runtime.

455,Selenium IDE - exporting test scripts ,I'm trying to export my test automation created in Selenium IDE but I can't find the option to export. I have a few test scenarios where the tests are the same but I need to make a copy of an existing test and swap some IDs for it to work. I can only save it as a .side file and not as individual Python scripts for Selenium. I'd like to export an existing script and re import it into Selenium IDE as a copy (where I can make some changes while keeping the majority of the commands the same). My Selenium IDE looks like this:  How can I export my test scripts (to Python) or how can I make a copy of an existing test script inside Selenium IDE (ex. make a copy of UAT FCC-A Application such that it makes another Test with all the same commands)?

466,linux - non-IDE C development environment ,"How do I set up a non-IDE-based C development environment on Linux?gcc + make + vi and you will live happily ever after! A pretty good development environment is most likely already there--no setup necessary.  This is because most Linux installations are  GCC. If I have to code on the command line I'd probably go with vi or nano over emacs I just can't cope with emacs anymore. Okay someone's gotta say it: Emacs gcc and make. If - as a commenter suggested - you're looking for instructions on setting this up there's probably no set up needed as most Linux distributions I've used come with these programs already installed. If you're not a masochist: gcc + cmake + nano ;) Make sure to edit your .nanorc file (you can copy an example from /etc/nanorc generally) Emacs + Cedet is the best I use gtkemacs gcc make but more often scons these days. This question is dangerously close to inciting religious wars.  Let me get it started: All configurations other than mine are inferior. I would recommend gcc + vim/vi + (make).  Vim/vi is almost impossible to ""just pick up and use"" because it will be completely foreign and you will struggle to even move the cursor or insert text but fortunately Vim comes with an extremely helpful tutor you can start by invoking the command > in the shell. It will get you up and running in no time! While Vim's interface is really bizarre and esoteric at first once you get used to it (shouldn't take very long once you finish vimtutor) you will see your productivity when editing code increase !"
467,scripting - interpreted java IDE environment ,In scripting languages like Ruby/Python/Perl we can start an interactive session and create new variables and essentially execute whatever statements. But in Java I only know of a way to print arbitrary expressions - in Eclipse's debug-expression view. There is no way to create new vars and later utilize that var (though you can assign to pre-existing vars). Is there any way to run Java in a interpreted IDE environment just like scripting languages?Check out  of JShell if you'd like to see it in action.

Using that I can compile and run my program. But I am facing problems in taking input from sublime text console. Is it possible to use scanf or cin function in Sublime text ?? If possible please suggest me the exact way.If not possible please suggest me a good IDE or text editor like sublime text by which I can easily run C or C++ program. N:B: Don't suggest me of using codeblocks. Take thanks in advance.As mentioned before REPL is a good solution. Another simple workaround is running the program in a new console window. Here's how my build system for running C++ programs on Windows looks like: You can save it into your sublime user packages catalog with extension .
471,How do I make my PHP IDE understand Dependency Injection Containers? ,Current situation: I have dependencies in my project that I solve by using dependency injection. I want to take the next logic step by using a dependency injection container (DIC) to ease the management of my dependencies and to lazy-load classes. I looked at  ran some test and really appreciate how DIC’s work. I’d probably go for Pimple because of its simplicity and raw power. If I didn’t have this problem: Due to the abstraction that DIC’s offer the IDE I’m using (PHPStorm) no longer understands what’s going on in my code. It doesn’t understand that $container['mailer'] or $sc-&gt;mailer is holding a class object. I also tried Netbeans IDE: same problem. This is really a problem for me because my IDE becomes useless. I don’t want to program without code hints autocompletion and refactoring tools when dealing with classes. And I don’t want my IDE to find all kinds of false positives when validating code. So my question is: Has anyone dealt with this problem and found a solution?You can define class of the variable 'manually': In PhpStorm (and by  which can read that file and open the autocomplete with the service names and its type (class string and etc). I'm using those two components and I can say that are good options for auto completion for Silex/Pimple. Pimple just introduce container builder principe. If you understand it you don't need Pimple any more: This way Pimple does not hide type of object in mixed $c['some key']. You would have autocomplete suggestions when edit your container. Phpstorm is able to autoresolve method return type from your code. And you would have clear container.  You can ever override container: To be honest container written in 'programming' lanuage is wrong way to go. Container responsibility is to bring initialized graph of objects to caller. Having access to 'programming language' allows to violate that responsibility with easy. Some DSL for configuring dependency is better. Moreover most of original dependency information (argument typehints of constructors) is just ignored by Pimple and sfDepenencyContainer making your configuration bloated and fragile.
473,python input() doesn't work in IDE - eof ,I've a problem with input() raw_input() commands in my NINJA-IDE. When I tried to type in NINJA-IDE command line: it gave me such result: But when I typed this commands in shell command line it works properly.My sys.version in NINJA_IDE is 2.7.3. I can't find any solution. Is it related with IDE preferences or environment variables $PATH or $PYTHONPATH?Any ideas?As far as I can see ninja IDE does not let you use input like . Sometimes this is related to the fact that the editor does not have access to  where you get the values in the console.  In the case of sublime text you can install SublimeREPL maybe there's something similar for ninja ide.

495,testing - How to loop tests in Selenium IDE? ,"I've been testing in Selenium IDE. It's pretty easy to use and I have created some test cases with it. I've been searching Google trying to find a way to repeat my tests automatically. I've seen a solution with gotolabel while loops etc. But I couldn't make any of them works. Can someone give me a tip on how to loop my test  times or loop forever. I appreciate any help. Do this: The js file provides goto gotoIf and while loop functionality in Selenium IDE. The example below shows a simple loop:   as stated in the answer above install the user extension which will add loop functionality to Selenium IDE tests. The example below shows a simple loop: I'm new to Selenium (just started using it a few minutes ago). After a quick Google search for ""selenium loop"" this stackoverflow.com question came up. I immediately jumped into the extension and started using loops. The accepted answer is very helpful. However I wanted to point out something else for others that are new to selenium (and stumble on this page). I created a simple test for a simple web page. I added a loop so that the test would run indefinitely (until I paused/stopped it). However I noticed that by doing this the Runs/Failures counters within the Selenium GUI do not increment with each loop (I am guessing because a single test case was never running to completion it was just looping indefinitely). So I dug a bit further. My goal was to leave the same test running for a long time (a few hours or possibly overnight) to see if there were any failures (I'm chasing an intermittent bug at the moment). The simplest way (for me after a few minutes of searching/experimenting) was to do the following (likely no plugins needed although the attached plugin is definitely helpful if you want to run a few small loops within a test case): Now I have the same simple test suite running many times and the Runs/Failures counters are incrementing as expected (without the need for any loops). Use the . After restarting Firefox use the  command to jump there. For example: There are other commands that you can see on the plug-in page and documented in the To loop forever just replace  with an extremely large number that will take centuries to execute which probably is as good as forever if you are running Selenium IDE. Selenium IDE now has flow control. These Control Flow commands work by specifying opening and closing commands to denote a set (or block) of commands.  Here are each of the available control flow commands accompanied by their companion and/or closing commands. if else if else endtimes enddo repeat ifwhile end You can read more about it here:  This is a sample for sampcop user in order to automate spam complaints using label and goto Label commands: 1st Login on spamcop.net  2nd use Report Spam option 3rd start this script Your test suite file is just an HTML file so just do the following: "
