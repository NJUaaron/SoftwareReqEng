This is especially useful if you have build files or logs or other temporary files that are part of your projects directory structure but you only want to search amongst the source code. You should also be aware of that files/directories matched for exclusion in the Resource Filters will not show up in the Package Explorer either so you might not always want this.

So what is this > that everyone knows but me? Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors. See  file. Linting is a process by a linter program that analyzes source code in a particular programming language and flag potential problems like syntax errors deviations from a prescribed coding style or using constructs known to be unsafe.  For example a JavaScript linter would flag the first use of parseInt below as unsafe:"

I'm also > closing this question so people can stillreact or maybe even add new suggestions or additions to thealready really nice answers... I recommend you read :   If you like Eclipse for Java I suggest Eclipse CDT. Despite C/C++ support isn't so powerful as is for Java it still offers most of the features. It has a nice feature named Managed Project that makes working with C/C++ projects easier if you don't have experience with Makefiles. But you can still use Makefiles.I do C and Java coding and I'm really happy with CDT. I'm developing the firmware for a embedded device in C and a application in Java that talks to this device and is really nice to  use the same environment for both. I guess it probably makes me more productive. I love how people completely miss the request in the original question for an IDE.  Linux is NOT an IDE.  That's just not what those words mean.  I learned c and c++ using vi and gcc and make and I'm not saying they aren't adequate tools but they are NOT an IDE.  Even if you use more elaborate tools like vim or emacs or whatever fancy editor you want typing commands on a command line is not an IDE. Also you all know make exists as part of visual studio right?  The idea that an IDE is ""limiting"" is just silly if you can use the IDE to speed some things yet are still able to fall back on command line stuff when needed. All that said I'd suggest as several above have trying Code blocks.  Its got decent code highlighting a pretty effortless way to create a project code it run it etc that is the core of a real IDE and seems fairly stable.  Debugging sucks...I have never seen a decent interactive debugger in any linux/unix variant.  gdb ain't it.  If you're used to visual studio style debugging you're pretty much out of luck. Anyway I'll go pack my things I know the one-view-only linux crowd will shout this down and run me out of town in no time. make + vim + gdb = one great IDE I quite like  for Eclipse could fill your needs? The Linux Tools project aims to bring a full-featured C and C++ IDE to Linux developers. We build on the source editing and debugging features of the CDT and integrate popular native development tools such as the GNU Autotools Valgrind OProfile RPM SystemTap GCov GProf LTTng etc. Current projects include LTTng trace viewers and analyzers an RPM .spec editor Autotools build integration a Valgrind heap usage analysis tool and OProfile call profiling tools. On Linux there are plenty of IDEs:  In > experience the most valuable are .Both provide all ""standard"" features (i.e. autocompletion syntax highlightning debugger git integration).It is worth noting that Eclipse also provides refactoring functionalities while Qt Creator provides integration with Valgrind and support for deployment on remote targets.

I'd mostly agree but the problem is also one of perception: we forget how difficult it was to become productive in any chose IDE (or other environment).  I find IDE's (Visual Studio NetBeans Eclipse) amazingly cumbersome in so many ways. As an old-time UNIX guy I always use Emacs. But that has a pretty steep   and long learning curve so I'm not sure I can recommend it to newcomers. I'd second that; use Emacs as my primary editor on both Linux and on MSW (XP2W2K).I would disagree that it has a > delays many seconds before refreshing files from disk.

14,eclipse - What is the best IDE to develop Android apps in? ,I am about to start developing an android app and need to get an IDE. Eclipse and the android eclipse plugin appears to be the natural choice. However I am familiar with intelliJ and re-sharper so I would prefer use intelliJ.  Has anyone used ? Is this any good? Should I just bite the bullet and learn Eclipse? IntelliJ now has support for Android. See  is the best option for android. i have used both eclipse and intellij and found intellij is much easier to use with android as compared to eclipse because of these reasons :- Intellij provides a built-in support for android and you don't have to configure it as you need to do with eclipse.Intellij gives you auto-lookup feature which is really important for developer like us to increase our productivity. And if we talk about eclipse you have to type each and every method classname etc on your own. (May be eclipse has this feature too but i never found it and trust me i tried to find it like anything)Its much more user friendly and easy to use than eclipse.I hope it will help you and other members of stack overflow to decide which IDE is best for Android development. My personal choice is Intellij. - visual editor. IDEA has one as well but it's rather primitive. I suspect that this feature will soon be deleted as IDEA will improve its editor.- many projects into one right pane (this is also my personal con as I like IDEA's one-project-per-pane thing)- faster compiles Android projects. IDEA has made its compilation process faster so I also soon expect to delete this Eclipse pro - faster intellisense (if you like Resharper then you know what I am talking about)- smarter autocomplete - my friend and I decided to write the same class. I finished before him simply because IDEA faster reacts to my wishes- incredibly smart - do not know what to do? just press Ctrl+Shift+Space and IDEA will tell you what should come there. It also recognizes naming scheme to if you're filling  method.- will add more as I remember of them   - Still the only con is that if you open Eclipse Android project and edit any XML layout file Eclipse will no longer be able to display edited file into its visual layout editor. This has not been fixed as of this day and it's IDEA's bug as it somehow messes the XML. Bottom line: if you're a person who does not see advantages of ReSharper in .NET (and we all coded in .NET) then you'll probably stick to Eclipse. It's official Android IDE and you believe it's the best.If you liked ReSharper and want to code faster then you'll appreciate IDEA and will stick to it forever.  An IDE which supports Android development is  - great for anyone familiar with Basic  Eclipse and Netbeans are both horrible slow and I'ts a miracle that even the serious developers has been sticking with it for years not even try to stick with a better product. Java as platform is a shame when it comes to non-handheld platforms (winmaclinux) and if anyone are going to develop on the platform I say do what else but do not use Java at all. For mobility it's probably has a kind of good luck here as the systems are more down-scaled. As far I know there aren't any existing IDE for Java which aren't iself written in a Java environment. This is horrible because Java is messing up the desktop  environment.  I'm willing to spend hours on google to find an Java IDE/Editor which are capable for android projects but will use a native environment for itself. I Feel Eclipse IDE is more suitable for android applications rather than other IDEs.Because its providing us more than five perspectives which will make our project flexible and ease.You may try Eclipse ides starts with 3.6 and above will provide you better performance.  which are all latest and supports all kind of access. I am a huge supporter of using the environment that is most familiar to you. However this isn't always the best option. In some cases a different environment can result in (far?) greater efficency in the long run. In this particular case I suspect that sticking with what you already know is a good option but someone starting new would benifit from the easy setup and sdk/ndk integration offered by eclipse. I also don't know how available geolocation manipulation (or phone state manipulation - ie incoming call etc) is in other IDE's but integration within eclipse feels seamless.  that i worked with that. you can try it.
15,How do you split and unsplit a window/view in Eclipse IDE? ,How do you split a window/view in Eclipse IDE? I want to edit code while viewing the different code in the same file. If there is a trick to open the same file twice this might do but I would rather just split the one current view instead of having two of the same which might get confusing.This is possible with the menu items . That works on Eclipse Juno or higher.For the previous Eclipse versions check  out Simply go to Window &gt; New Window This will open up a new window of the same Workspace in eclipse.  You can open up separate files in each Window. Below are the steps to  editor horizontally or verticallygo to:  to split editor horizontally or to split editor vertically. It will open two editors side by side or will pileup tow. If you want to see two different files in same eclipse you can Right-click a tab -&gt;  to tabs again.
19,Tips for using Vim as a Java IDE? ,"I'm addicted to Vim it's now my de facto way of editing text files. Being that it's mainly a text editor and not an IDE has anyone got tricks for me to make it easier when developing Java apps? Some questions I have: Anything else (other than ""Don't do it!"") that I should know about?Some tips: Have fun :-) I've been a Vim user for years.  I'm starting to find myself starting up Eclipse occasionally (using the vi plugin which I have to say has a variety of issues).  The main reason is that Java builds take quite a while...and they are just getting slower and slower with the addition of highly componentized build-frameworks like maven.  So validating your changes tends to take quite a while which for me seems to often lead to stacking up a bunch of compile issues I have to resolve later and filtering through the commit messages takes a while. When I get too big of a queue of compile issues I fire up Eclipse.  It lets me make cake-work of the changes.  It's slow brutal to use and not nearly as nice of an editor as Vim is (I've been using Vim for nearly a decade so it's second nature to me).  I find for precision editingâ€”needing to fix a specific bug needing to refactor some specific bit of logic or something else...I simply can't be as efficient at editing in Eclipse as I can in Vim. Also a tip: This makes ). I have just uploaded  for the development of Java Maven projects. And don't forget to set the highlighting if you haven't already:  EDIT:  Oh an BTW i've tried eclim off and on but the reason I like vim is its lightness.  Executing eclipse even on headless mode is just too much mental lifting for me. EDIT2:  I've been using playframework lately and this will probably work with maven builds too: For compiling you can configure VIM's make to run maven or in mycase run a build script tee that to a file. ""play_compile"" is just a compile script.  It uses SBT so Maven should work just fine here.  Even direct javac will work.  This way you can use VIM""s quickfix buffer (:cnext :clist: cprev etc). For jumping around the classes I use .  Its beautiful. Use it.  Faster than eclipse in jumping around files. For jumping around methods I use tagsearch with exuberant c-tags. Jump into method declarations by using ctrl-].  Go back    usingCtrl-o.  Doesnt work as good as eclipse but it works good enough. I use  is a nice tool for coding with useful snippets (like in TextMate). You can use (or modify) a pre-made package or make your own."
24,What Ruby IDE do you prefer? ,I've been using Eclipse with RDT (not RadRails) a lot lately and I'm quite happy with it but I'm wondering if you guys know any decent alternatives. I know NetBeans also supports Ruby these days but I'm not sure what it has to offer over Eclipse. Please list any features you think are brilliant or useful when suggesting an IDE makes it easier to compare. Also I said Ruby not Rails. While Rails support is a plus I prefer things to be none Rails-centric. It should also be available on Linux and optionally Solaris.Have you tried . Once I found Geany (Ubuntu) I switched from TextMate (OSX) and never looked back. Geany is a lean clean speedy IDE that can be used either as a text editor or a light-weight IDE. It supports not only text editing features (syntax highlighting code folding auto-completion auto-closing symbol lists code navigation directory tree multi-tabbed open files etc.) but also normal IDE features such as simple project management compile-build-run within the main window. Unlike TextMate it has a Terminal screen within its own window; you do not have to go back and force between your editor window and terminal window. Unlike TextMate it supports international languages. Unlike TextMate it supports multi-platforms Unlike TextMate it is open-source and free. Geany is now my favorite C/Ruby/XML development tool.   RubyMine is so awesome. Everything just works. I could go on and on. Code completion is fast smooth and accurate. Formatting is instantaneous. Project navigation is easy and without struggle. You can pop open any file with a few keystrokes. You don't even need to keep the project tree open but it's there if you want. You can configure just about any aspect of it to behave exactly how you want. NetBeans Eclipse and RubyMine all have more or less the same set of features. However RubyMine is just so much more cleanly designed and easy to use. There's nothing awkward or clunky about it. There are all these nice little design touches that show how JetBrains really put thought into it instead of just amassing a big pile of features. Incidentally RubyMine can do a lot of the things that Vim can do like select and edit a column of text or split the view into several editing panels with different files in them. 
25,LLVM C++ IDE for Windows ,Is there some C/C++ IDE for Windows which is  (merged from answers):LLVM is supported in  as far as I know. I am the main author of the plug-in so you can ask any questions related to it. The plug-in offers the basic functionality for Clang and llvm-gcc compilation and support Linux and Windows (w/ Cygwin &amp; MiNGW). LLVM tools such as assembler archiver linker and static compiler (llc) are configured and can be customized via UI. The plug-in offers all the benefits that IDE can offer such as easy configuration and building with one action.  The only drawback is that it is not ready yet as it lacks of some of the advanced features that LLVM can offer such as Clang analyze and smart auto-completion. The plug-in is also not tested well and may not work perfectly therefore I hope I can get user feedback via mailing list found from Google code development site (listed below). I wish I had time to develop it further. I only develop it in my spare time which is very limited. I welcome any developers to participate and contribute to the project. Development site: Eclipse marketplace (100% free &amp; open-source):.It can be downloaded s as of 2018 which is crucial for debugging).

36,java.io.Console support in Eclipse IDE ,"I use the Eclipse IDE to develop compile and run my Java projects. Today I'm trying to use the  when an application is run ""through"" Eclipse. Eclipse run the program on a background process rather than a top-level process with the console window we're familiar with. Is there a way to force Eclipse to run the program as a top level process or at least create a Console that the JVM will recognize? Otherwise I'm forced to jar the project up and run on a command-line environment external to Eclipse.I assume you want to be able to use step-through debugging from Eclipse. You can just run the classes externally by setting the built classes in the bin directories on the JRE classpath. You can debug using the remote debugger and taking advantage of the class files built in your project. In this example the Eclipse project structure looks like this:  So all you have to do any time you want to debug the app is: You can track this issue in  offers alternatives to using System.console(). One is to use a BufferedReader wrapped around System.in the second is to use a Scanner wrapped around System.in.  Neither are as concise as console but both work in eclipse without having to resort to debug silliness! Let's say your Eclipse workspace is C:\MyWorkspace you created your java application inside a maven project MyProject and your Java main class is com.mydomain.mypackage.MyClass. In this case you can run your main class that uses  on the command line: NB1: if it's not in a maven project check the output folder in project properties | Java Build Path | Source. It might not be ""target/classes"" NB2: if it is a maven project but your class is in src/test/java you'll likely have to use ""target\test-classes"" instead of ""target\classes"""
39,java - IDE for Swing ,Is there any IDE that simplifies creating Swing applications (ideally something along the lines of Visual Studio)Like others have mentioned NetBeans' visual editor is pretty good but it's based pretty heavily on the  plugin: which is also based on Eclipse simply adding a few plugins to it as many other commercial products do. It is still not able to parse any Swing code (I doubt any Swing WISIWYG editor does) but if you start with it it gives you relatively seamless experience.You need to pay for it though. At the end of the day I have worked with different similar UI tools Flash Builder Delphi etc. but unless you do some relatively trivial UI design not including much business logic and communication with other layers you'll have to accept that what you are capable of creating in code once you learn to do it properly is much more powerful than what any editor is capable of providing you with. I have switched between several IDEs and the one that I believe has the best GUI builder in terms of use and performance would have to be NetBeans. I have tried a few and the closest I have found that comes close to Visual Studio is NetBeans. Version 6.5 is excellent and really improved over version 5. I'm a big fan of JetBrains and when it comes to Java  Use NetBeans I have also successfully developed one application using NetBeans. It is realy awesome it helps you while writing the code.Since Swing generates some code on its own so it is really helpful to use Netbeans.Go through it and you can always ask question and problems.It will be good if you go for latest version release. I have always coded my UIs by hand. The frustration of dealing with screen builders and filling out all those property sheets is too much for me. After a couple of screens and a little research I am just as productive. As I'm using Eclipse I use the Visual Editor plugin. It generates clean source code with good patterns and easy to patch/modify/extend.Unfortunately it is not very stable. But it's worth trying. I like Eclipse's VisualEditor (VE) and sometime ago I've tried to switch toanother editor but I found it impossible. Visual editor has thisfeature that it generates manageable readable editable and easy-to-understand code. Unlike both mentioned earlier NetBeans editor and WindowBuilder it uses the lazy initialization pattern to separate initialization of components. Also it does not need to lock down parts of code that you can't edit; you may edit code by hand and VE is still able to work with your changes. The only disadvantage of VE is that it uses  is good option and it is free also. As others have mentioned my best experience with Java SWING applications is with NetBeans. NetBeans has a WYSIWYG editor and the code is automatically generated for you which is then protected however you can add custom code to add listeners and other events that the end user may be interested in using such as buttons text forms and areas and other nice GUI tools.
40,Best C++ IDE or Editor for Windows ,"What is the best C++ IDE or editor for using on Windows? I use Notepad++ but am missing IntelliSense from Visual Studio.I've found the latest release of NetBeans which includes C/C++ support to be excellent.  a powerful open-source cross platform IDE. It has code completion amongst other features. I will quote myself from this question: Someone already said this before me  but QtCreator is really good for Qt4  development. Not only it has a really good code  completion support. It also knows a  little more about the code and what to  complete then I thought I needed. For  example it knows about slots/signals.  This means that connecting  slots/signals via code is much easier  then before. The code editing is really nice. I  remember that when refactoring code  (a few variables starting with  underscore) it remembered the cursor  position between lines and this made  the refactoring much easier. The code  indentation is smart enough to not get  in my way (KDevelop was configurable  but QtCreator learns how I code. At  least it feels like it does). Then there are the cool key  combinations. Most of the  functionality of the IDE can be  accessed using shortcuts. The  ""control+k"" thingie is a nice thing  which some command line users would  like but I am more GUI oriented. I  don't use it. What I really like is the split  window command. Yes KDevelop3 does  it but not as nice as QtCreator. My  favorite is control+e3 which I use to  display the header and implementations  of my classes. Once again the  navigation here is the best I have  seen (control+eo). It also has a nice SCM integration. I  usually use SVN and quite frankly  it's not as good as I need: no  shortcut to diff the project no diff  to commit the whole project no option  to commit several files. I also don't like the ""total  integration of external tools"". I  still like the external QtAssistant -  control+tab is easier to read large  articles. But.... when you define a  QString s and 3 lines bellow you want  to read the interface of QString you  put your cursor on ""s"" and press F1 -  the assistant comes as a sidebar with  QString's documentation. A huge  advantage. Want to follow a definition? F2 to the  help. F4? Changes  header/implementation (yes eclipse  does this better...). The debugger is good. It's not as good  as VisualStudio but ... it has support  for Qt4 internals (you can see the  value of QString and QList!). I can continue... but IMHO you will  need to give it a second and third  try. It really is a good product. Not  as flexible as Eclipse (hi  ryansstack) but it's a really small  fast and young project. I stopped  developing QDevelop because I really  found what I was looking for. ps: yes I mean stopped developing  QDevelop. I was in the development  team. My response is for Qt4 development only. Be warned. SlickEdit is very cool and does support something like intellisense. At my current company I now use Visual Studio and I've mostly gotten used to it - but there are still some SlickEdit features I miss.  As a complete all-in one package Visual Studio 2008 is the best IDE for C++ development with Windows Visual studio is great but there are few tricks you can enhance it with. SonicFileFinder is one - helps you to search source files by partial match. You can map solution-tree to Alt+1 partial filename search to alt+2 and properties-window to alt+3. These are the three most used windows.  Another great tool that is ofter misunderstood is ctrl+shift+F shortcut for searching file contents. People dont use because it's so slow but my advice is - deal with it. Searching  the whole solution (or even all files in project folder) is only slow the first time you use it. Consequitive searches are as fast as jump-to-definition-feature. I've tried SlickEdit Notepad++ emacs jEdit and Visual Studio. VS wins hands-down for Best Windows IDE.  jEdit is probably the best GUI cross-platform editor/almost-IDE and emacs is probably the best terminal cross-platform editor/almost-IDE. The advantage with using these is that when you jump to a Mac or Linux box you know how they work.  I tried Eclipse but it ran like a no-legged dog it was so slow so I didn't use it much. Maybe tech is better now but eh. With Intellisense code folding edit and continue and a whole host of other features Visual Studio is certainly the best IDE.  However for simple code editing I often use UltraEdit.  It has some great features not found in Visual Studio.  One surprisingly useful feature is being able to select a column in the editor.  You can find and replace within the column (useful for tabs vs. spaces wars...) delete the column etc... How about CodeBlocks i find it so fine with me especially the new 10.05 version. I would recommend . Here's another vote for Visual Studio.  The debugger and Intellisense are definitely it's hallmarks.  While other IDE's offer code-completion I've often found them to be somewhat sluggish in this area for some reason (sluggish being a reference to the speed at which code-completion occurs and offers selections).   Other than VS NetBeans is a good polished IDE and is updated on a very regular cycle. I think it's largely a matter of taste but I would recommend begginers to stick to a pure editor (vi emacs...) instead of a full fledged IDE so they can figure out the whole toolchain that modern IDEs hide. Just for the record my weapon of choice is Emacs. personally i dont like microsoft......I hate to admit that visual studio is the best IDE i ever use.....Netbeans is gud but drasticaly slow....other free IDEs are useless..so people try to stick with VS.... M$ VS2008 is a better IDE for this. The question says specifically IDE so I am guessing thats what you want. In that case the main options are Visual Studio and Eclipse CDT as stated above. Of those I personally prefer Eclipse. However don't necessarily limit yourself to an IDE. I prefer to use vim as my editor and WinDbg as my debugger.

49,Which IDE for Scala 2.8? ," is the same question for older version of Scala but they say that Eclipse plugin has been improved vastly. Is it the best IDE now? How do different Scala IDE compare today? I've been pretty successful with IDEA 9. I've briefly tried both Netbeans and Eclipse and wasn't able to get what I wanted. Eclipse's code-complete didn't behave as well as I'd have liked and I couldn't find a way to make Netbeans handle Scala scripts; It'd just complain that the file wasn't a class. To be clear I've been using IDEA for a few years for Java so keep that in mind:) For the moment Scala Plugin in IntelliJ IDEA is the best. It handles Scala 2.8 well. IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition is now free and open source (and works with Scala) so I can't see any reason for not using it. The plugin is still somewhat buggy (many ""false negatives"" i.e. the code without red underscores may not compile successfully; but almost no ""false positives"") but perfectly usable. The best thing is that you can use IDEA's excellent debugger with Scala (not without some issues but it actually works!). FSC (Fast Scala Compiler) is also supported in latest builds. A huge time-saver. The plugin development team is quite responsive. Some of the guys work directly in JetBrains and possess intimate knowledge about IDEA platform so the development progresses fast. JetBrains IDEA's Scala plug-in handles 2.7 and 2.8 equally well. I cannot make any comparisons because I have used only IDEA. Using Eclipse Helios with the dev-version of the new Scala(2.8) plugin as there isn't an official release yet. That > beta definitively -- but I can't confirm the frequently expressed opinion that this plugin is outright horrible ;-) I'd say the experience is already OK-ish and indeed better than the current state of affairs with the Groovy plugin. OTOH the experience with plain Java is way more smooth (feels like flying at times) and the current CDT I'd rate somewhat in between. Incremental compile and error highlighting work quite well for me; tweaking a DSL implementation into form just by continuously rewriting your code until the error markers are gone -- without ever having to test-run your program -- is outright fun and just again shows that FP / static typing rocks! Problems encountered from time to time:- implicits and nested types in other compilation units (esp. nested / super packages) aren't picked up at times when there are still other errors around; they will be picked up after an full build- there seems to be a memory leak in the version I'm using right now (from end august 2010) necessitating to restart the workbench after some hours of work- beware when you're using AspectJ to make sure you get a version of the Scala plugin which relies on a JDT weaving bundle version which also works with AJDT PS: I'm using maven builds in all my projects and generated the eclipse projects with the eclipse-maven-plugin and then imported them as plain-flat eclipse projects. I can just strongly recommend everyone to keep away from the M2-eclipse plugin (for maven) in its current (2010) state it makes your workbench painfully slow is buggy and has lots of almost unpredictable behaviour because it constantly tries to do magic things behind the scenes (and besides that the aspectj support is broken since this spring) i use both eclipse and IDEA eclipse supports type detection isbetter than IDEA (it is veryneccessery thing if you want programin functional style that you can beaware from type of expressions andvariables.) : IDEA supports type detection like eclipse but you haveto define a value in your functionsfor example: deftestTs[A](a:List[String]b:List[A])= for{      ai &lt;- a      bi &lt;- b    }  yield (aibi)   }deftestTs[A](a:List[String]b:List[A]):List[(StringA)]={    val result = for{      ai &lt;- a      bi &lt;- b    }  yield (aibi)   }I think that the best option so far is the ScalaIDE for Eclipse. You can go to the ScalaIDE Web Site and look around to see by yourself.  to get an idea. For everyone who is really considering doing some serious development with Scala I strongly recommend to evaluate the IDEs in question beyond the basics. When you are into an agile approach which in my option requires a painless refactoring support without surprises (especially in multi-module projects) things are pretty tight at the moment. It would be pretty neat if someone came up with a IDE independent specification-like list of refactorings (and desired outcomes) which could be used to verify an IDE's refactoring support. The officially endorsed and supported (by Typesafe) for Scala 2.9 is Eclipse. The current version is far superior to prior versions and includes a context-aware REPL full-featured debugger and even the ability to debug REPL statements.  I think this question needs to be updated and the answers revisited. I don't recommend the Scala IDE/Eclipse.  It doesn't have a lot of the features that are even available for Eclipse with Java.  And there are bugs. I am using the latest NetBeans and haven't tried anything else. I've met at least 2 notable bugs in NetBeans while coding in Scala: One: NB occasionally come unable to run a program hanging on classpath scanning.Solution: Create a new project copy your code there and go on.Comment:  of particular namespaces or classes and complains when you use them.Solution: Just ignore and go on - compiler founds no errors and the program works. I'd recommend IDEA's plugin for now. The Scala plugin for NetBeans is quite nice too. It doesn't yet support NetBeans 6.9 the newest release though and you still need to download it manually instead of installing it directly from the plugin manager inside NetBeans.  However it integrates better with Maven projects than IDEA's plugin does (this is true for NB and IDEA in general in my opinion). It partly depends on your style of working as all the options have strengths and weaknesses. If you need refactoring across mixed java/scala projects then IntelliJ is your only option. If you want to do any work on the compiler or a compiler plugin then Eclipse has the advantage of being able to launch a runtime workspace with a custom compiler build including breakpoints.  It also improved massively for the 2.8 Scala release. Netbeans is a fine choice to go with if you're already very familiar with that platform the costs of learning a new environment may well outweigh any benefits and all three solutions are improving rapidly. I haven't tried netbeans scala plugin yet but I find that Intellij IDEA plugin is at any way much better a scala ide than the Scala eclipse plugin which is sooooo slow that drives me crazy.Though swing applications don't work well with my tiling window manager. try IDEAX the latest community edition of Intellij IDEA (version 10) it has improved scala plugin which has faster code compilation and exceution in addition to that it has Maven3 and SBT support with which we can develop Lift applications. IntelliJ IDEA community edition + Scala Plugin + SBT plugin"
52,Choosing an IDE/Editor for Clojure coding ,"I'm looking for an editor or an IDE for my Clojure coding and I found this thread: However I have a couple of questions:Which IDE offers the best Clojure environment (right now): IntelliJ Eclipse or NetBeans?What are the advantages of Aquamacs (I read Rick is using it) over the previous heavy-weight IDEs?I have spent significant chunks of time (on a Mac) with: My opinions on those: > - The Eclipse editor is coming along and the structural editing has some of the niceties of paredit (but not the truly essential slurp barf splice capability).  The Eclipse repl is just a stock command-line repl and is pretty bad in comparison to NetBeans.  However the NetBeans remote repl has been broken out into an independent project and is coming very soon to Eclipse which will make Eclipse even more attractive.  Maven integration is very good.  I use Eclipse now when I want to see lots of files and projects at once which I have a hard time doing in Emacs. At the moment my bet is that the Eclipse tooling will start to pull away from the others.  But I'm still hoping for a Clojure-specific IDE to show up. :)      The world has changed a lot since I first wrote this. There are now at least 6 very good Clojure environments. If you have not allegiance to a pre-existing editor and want an easy place to start there are two great choices: 1)  There you can see most of the keyboard shortcuts. Sublime Text with Paredit and SublimeREPL is a quite a good option. Sublime Text is a powerful and light weight editor. It enjoys a big umbrella of plugins. Agree with Alex. I have tried NetBeansEmacs Textmate and Eclipse on OSX. For now Eclipse is a better choice. BTW it also depends on your background. If you are a Java programmer Eclipse is a very good choice. Sometimes I use the REPL - for example to try out Clojure 1.3 Alpha3.We do need a Clojure-specific IDE; something like Komodo. There is a new Clojure plugin for Intellij called .   Unfortunately it looks like . Make sure you can get emacs.app for mac.  According to the writer:""The reason I recommend Emacs is that it offers tight integration with a Clojure REPL which allows you to instantly try out your code as you write. That kind of tight feedback loop will be useful while learning Clojure and later when writing real Clojure programs. Emacs is also great for working with any Lisp dialect; in fact Emacs is written in a Lisp dialect called Emacs Lisp (elisp).""."
53,Scheme IDE for Windows ,What is a good Scheme IDE for Windows? OK I'll admit it; I'm not at RMS's level and don't want to use Emacs or any character-based interface -- I want a graphic IDE with colorization a REPL and usable in-line help for a specific well-documented dialect of Scheme. I have searched around and PLT Scheme/DrScheme seems the best but even that does not look too sophisticated. is an excellenet product well worth taking a look at. It's got all the features you're asking for I think what you want actually is Emacs. Let's see: I've been playing with Xacc.Ide and Iron Scheme and found they were pretty good although they felt not finished in some places. They're good enough for trying out scheme I'm not sure if I'd use them for writing commercial software though. I've seen the author of both of them hang around here so maybe he can tell more.. As far as I know (I used DrScheme for a few months before switching to Emacs) DrScheme has many IDE-like features but they are presented in a simplified interface because of its educational focus. Do some digging and I think you'll be happy what you find. Also I can't resist since I > use Emacs---an OS specific install of emacs is hardly ever character based. I just found out the scheme plugin for eclipse I haven't try it yet.It looks pretty nice.and its git repository I personally use ChezScheme. I run scheme scripts from the console and edit them in eclipse using the SchemeWay plugin. Eclipse is superior to Emacs in my opinion and it has some nice features like automatic indentation and autocomplete for defined names.
54,php - PHPDoc type hinting for array of objects? ,"So in PHPDoc one can specify  doesn't seem to be valid for example. The best you can do is say I do that a lot in Zend Studio. Don't know about other editors but it ought to work. In the PhpStorm IDE from JetBrains you can use  is not necessary. . I prefer to read and write clean code - as outlined in ""Clean Code"" by Robert C. Martin.When following his credo you should not require the developer (as user of your API) to know the (internal) structure of your array.  The API user may ask: Is that an array with one dimension only? Are the objects spread around on all levels of a multi dimensional array? How many nested loops (foreach etc.) do i need to access all objects? What type of objects are ""stored"" in that array? As you outlined you want to use that array (which contains objects) as a one dimensional array.  As outlined by Nishi you can use: for that.  But again: be aware - this is not a standard docblock notation. This notation was introduced by some IDE producers.  Okay okay as a developer you know that ""[]"" is tied to an array in PHP. But what do a ""something[]"" mean in normal PHP context? ""[]"" means: create new element within ""something"". The new element could be everything. But what you want to express is: array of objects with the same type and itÂ´s exact type. As you can see the IDE producer introduces a new context. A new context you had to learn. A new context other PHP developers had to learn (to understand your docblocks). Bad style (!). Because your array do have one dimension you maybe want to call that ""array of objects"" a ""list"". Be aware that ""list"" has a very special meaning in other programming languages. It would be mutch better to call it ""collection"" for example. Remember: you use a programming language that enables you all options of OOP.Use a class instead of an array and make your class traversable like an array. E.g.: Or if you want to store the internal objects on different levels within an multi dimensional array/object structure: This solution replaces your array by an object of type ""orderCollection"" but do not enable code completion within your IDE so far. Okay. Next step: Implement the methods that are introduced by the interface with docblocks - particular:  Do not forget to use type hinting for: This solution stops introducing a lot of: all over your code files (e.g. within loops) as Zahymaka confirmed with her/his answer. Your API user is not forced to introduce that docblocks to have code completion. To have @return on only one place reduces the redundancy (@var) as mutch as possible. Sprinkle ""docBlocks with @var"" would make your code worst readable. Finaly you are done. Looks hard to achive? Looks like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Not realy since you are familiar with that interfaces and with clean code. Remember: your source code is written once / read many. If code completion of your IDE do not work with this approach switch to a better one (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA PhpStorm Netbeans) or file a feature request on the issue tracker of your IDE producer. Thanks to Christian Weiss (from Germany) for being my trainer and for teaching me such a great stuff. PS: Meet me and him on XING.  Now usage of classes: Once again: I suspect not all IDE support it but PhpStorm does. Try yours post in comment the results! I know I'm late to the party but I've been working on this problem recently.  I hope someone sees this because the accepted answer although correct is > the best way you can do this.  Not in PHPStorm at least I haven't tested NetBeans though. The best way involves extending the ArrayIterator class rather than using native array types.  This allows you to type hint at a class-level rather than at an instance-level meaning you only have to PHPDoc once not throughout your code (which is not only messy and violates DRY but can also be problematic when it comes to refactoring - PHPStorm has a habit of missing PHPDoc when refactoring) See code below: The key here is the PHPDoc  to signify ""an array of Foo's"" but it's not supported by IDE's. I've found something which is working it can save lives !"

88,Is Matlab an IDE? ,"I'm a little confused as to what classifies as an IDE. According to Wikipedia: An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. So is MatLab considered an IDE? As with many things in software there are no hard rules. But if anything fits the description of IDE matlab does.  The basic engine can be run purely from the command line but when you marry that with the graphical environment it has all the hallmarks of an IDE - richly featured text editor debugging support memory/workspace introspection etc etc.  In some ways the IDE is what you pay for. Minus that there's little advantage over open source numerical languages like Python or Julia.  MatLab workbooks could be considered and IDE. Depending how you define ""comprehensive facilities"" Vim is an IDE."

100,vim - Modal fully fledged IDE ,I am trying to find a good IDE. I always found Vim's modal behaviour interesting but Vim is more of a text editor than an IDE. Even though I have made a few changes to my .vimrc file Vim isn't IDE enough. Any suggestions? FYI: By IDE I mean it's got to have a debugger autocomplete and easy compilation  Edit: I do web development backend node.js python and Ruby on RailsI'd start by listing features you need from your IDE in order of importance.  Think about (random order): Of course you can consider many more features and find them much more important than the ones I listed here. It's totally individual preference since that's you who has to be comfortable.  If you want to use the power of VIM you have basically three options:  Start with vanilla VIM and incrementally add settings and plugins you need. Check out existing configs and adapt them. To make it fully fledged IDE I'd recommend some plugins:  I recommend one of these: or this:  It also depends what your programming environment is. Having autocomplete and compiling from in the vim editor is no problem. Debugging depends but you can also do debugging with other tools and be perfectly fine. Just because other IDEs do it doesn't mean it's the best way. Don't try to get it perfect just from the beginning and don't try to copy every feature your known IDE has. Accept the initial pain and enjoy all those little improvements that you can make every single day. All those improvements will sum up and after a while you will be very proficient. Even years after you still will find ways to improve your workflow. There has been recent development in (at least) those three projects based on nvim extensibility and addressing your very concern: I seems that they are all in early alpha though let's hope the best for them :)
101,Is there any online IDE for Java? ,It doesn't have to be full blown of course and console output only would be enough.

103,Best IDE/Editor for ColdFusion? ,"I am just starting at a job in which I will be using a lot of ColdFusion. What is the best IDE/Editor to use?I'd like to provide my personal reasoning behind why you might choose any of these editors (at least the ones I'm familiar with). Just saying ""use this use that"" is not at all helpful. To large degree the question is wrong. There's rarely a ""best IDE"" for a language; rather there are multiple environments each suiting particular needs. Here goes: 1) Dreamweaver Why you would use it: its history as a designer tool makes it much easier for ""non-coder"" types to start cranking out websites. If you're a solo developer building a lot of ""Tom's Corner Store"" type of sites even if they require some CF Coding (mailing list subscribers current specials light content management etc) its design tools ""template"" features and ease-of-deployment (ftp) make it an attractive choice. It has good-enough code coloring and code completion for the built-in CF tags and functions. It can interrogate user-defined functions in the same page. It has excellent CSS support. You can find a wealth of extensions too.  It's pretty stable and in my experience hasn't been very ""crashy"". It will do a fair amount of code generation for you as well (whether that code is ""good"" is debatable).  All in all Dreamweaver is incredible software for web site designers. Why you wouldn't use it: It is not free and it is certainly not a ""coder's editor"". While it provides for extensions they're typically interface-focused (javascript validation etc) unlike say Eclipse plugins which can run the gamut. For large projects it simply does not have the code navigation features that many coders come to expect. It's web-focused. So if you're a polyglot or even just like to dabble in compiled languages (java etc) then you'll need to keep another editor on hand for those tasks.... you won't be able to do it all in one place.  ColdFusion unit testing support is nonexistent in Dreamweaver. There is no step debugging for ColdFusion. 2) CFEclipse plugged into Eclipse.  Why you'd use it: CFEclipse is going on 6 years old now and has matured significantly. It's been quite stable for the last few years and most crashiness has been due to Eclipse itself and not CFEclipse (which was not true in the early days). Recently CFEclipse has seen an infusion of fresh blood and features are being added to make coding in it even more productive.  It contains a wealth of keyboard shortcuts many of the toolbar features people love from ColdFusion Studio days and Eclipse's in-built code navigation features (namely Ctrl-Shift-R for finding files quickly). It has content assist for native CF Tags and functions and some support for in-page variables though that's never worked all that well. It does not support in-page functions nor does it provide native true component insight (i.e. insight into components that you write and use in other code). It will support component insight to some extent with Dictionaries but even then it requires a lot of work on the part of the dictionary creator. Most people find dictionaries too much work to maintain in my experience. The lastest version of CFEclipse contains the best CFML formatting you'll find.  For me ""method explorer"" and ""Snip Tree View"" -- particularly keyboard shortcuts for inserting snippets -- have been big productivity boosters. If you work with ColdSpring ModelGlue Mach-II ColdBox and other frameworks with xml configuration files CFEclipse's Framework Explorer is brilliant. Because it's a plugin to Eclipse you can do everything else you'd want to do in Eclipse. You wanna code java? You can. You want webservice support? you got that. You want to do step debugging you can do so with the free Adobe-provided extensions for Eclipse. The large plugin ecosystem is one of the most attractive features of Eclipse and you shouldn't discount this when deciding on an editor. For example I would not want to work without Mylyn which integrates with issue tracking and in my experience has transformed the way I work much for the better. Eclipse's version control system support is excellent as well. Subversion is well supported; there's a VSS plugin; and recently a git plugin (if not two) has been accepted into the Eclipse foundation so we'll see native git support very soon (you can get it now with a plugin). Eclipse's ANT support is excellent.  You can easily plug the MXUnit Eclipse plugin into Eclipse for unit testing your CFML (full disclosure: I contribute to MXUnit). Finally I have full confidence that the folks working on CFEclipse -- Denny Mark Jim Peter et al. -- will continue to work toward keeping CFEclipse as the best open source CFML IDE available. These are some of the brightest minds in the ColdFusion community and are passionate about their mission. If you choose to use CFEclipse you are not choosing to use an IDE that will be supplanted by ColdFusion Builder. This project is in good hands. Why you wouldn't use it: it's a code IDE not a design tool like Dreamweaver. It's not perfect... code assist can be too aggressive in its suggestions. Eclipse itself especially when you pile it up with all kinds of plugins can get unstable on lesser machines.  Finally people who don't like the ""Project"" view of the world often have complaints about it because they're used to working directly with the file system view of the world. Its deployment support is nowhere near as simple as Dreamweaver though you can find plugins that get close. 3) ColdFusion Builder Why you'd use it: all of what I said previously about Eclipse itself applies to CFBuilder when used as a plugin to Eclipse. I cannot speak to the Standalone version because as of this writing it still doesn't support plugins very well. This will most surely be fixed by the time it is released but I don't want to speculate on what the Standalone may or may not do. One of CFBuilder's big draws is ""Extensions"". These are a way to plug in CFML code into your editor. It's hard to describe so I'd suggest googling for ""ColdFusion Builder Extensions"" and you'll most likely be amazed. Adobe's Terry Ryan has created ""Apptacular"" for scaffolding applications from a database and Brian Rinaldi has a series of posts on building CFBuilder extensions. These are huge and will prove themselves to be a developer's best friend after CFBuilder is released. CFBuilder's deployment support is in my opinion on par with if not superior to Dreamweaver's. CFBuilder does not require an additional plugin to do step debugging. Just hit the debug button and off you go. CFBuilder contains true component insight meaning that it can introspect components you write and provide ctrl-space content assist. It can be wonky however and does require some configuration. But please remember that as of now CFBuilder is still in beta. My best guess is that it'll be at least a few versions until all the kinks are worked out of this feature. Still it's a big productivity and learning booster to get content assist on your own components. CFBuilder provides a ""Servers"" view for stopping/starting your CF Server. It's built on Aptana and so contains the Aptana ""tail log"" view which is great for watching log files. Just like CFEclipse it has a Snip Tree View. The CFBuilder ""vision"" is led by Adobe's Adam Lehman. He's passionate about CF and is a force of nature. I have great hopes for CFBuilder because of Adam's leadership. Why you wouldn't use it: For one it won't be free. Noone outside Adobe knows yet how much it will cost however. ""Extensions"" and the deployment features alone may be worth the price. Time will tell. Because it's an Adobe product I think it's reasonable to assume that releases will come as frequently as most Adobe products which means... not very often. While CFEclipse deploys rather frequently lately -- and makes available a ""nightly"" site for the brave -- CFBuilder will most likely not do such daring-do. CFEclipse can afford to make potentially unstable builds available to the public while it is perhaps not in Adobe's best interests to do so with CFBuilder. Finally it's still in Beta and might not be released for some time. If you get it now and start using it remember that. In my experience debugging is wonky content assist sometimes works sometimes doesn't and a lot of people have experience crashiness. It's free beta software... you're getting what you pay for. But know that the more you work with this beta release and particularly if you provide feedback via the public bug database the better off all of us will be if it provides a best of breed editor for CFML. Personally: At home when I do ""designer"" work I use Dreamweaver when I feel that its Templates will help me build a site as quickly as possible. For existing side projects which require maintenance coding and easy deployments I use ColdFusion builder. At work where I do almost no design work CFEclipse has been my IDE since 2006. I've begun using ColdFusion builder a lot though currently I split my time between CFBuilder and CFEclipse. One reason is that as of this writing CFEclipse is more stable (i.e. it doesn't crash and I don't lose work). I fully expect stability problems to be mitigated by the time CFBuilder costs money.  Both CFBuilder and CFEclipse have public bug databases. CFEclipse has a well-attended public mailing list and if you have questions you'll get answers quickly. I cannot yet speak to the speed with which CFBuilder questions are answered. Finally for ""coders"" it's my experience that once you invest the time in learning the tools and shortcuts Eclipse provides superior productivity compared with designer tools like Dreamweaver. For cranking out a designed site a designer tool like Dreamweaver confers significant advantages. The answer to the best ColdFusion IDE isn't an answer but a question: ""What are you trying to do with ColdFusion?"" The answer to that question will lead you to an IDE that suits your needs for a particular project. Different circumstances or projects may lead you to a different tool which better suits your needs. Notepad++ with CF syntax highlighting. For free: Eclipse with CFEclipes plugin For cost: If you're a developer use Coldfusion Builder if you're a front end designer Dreamweaver edits Coldfusion pretty well. I use it quite often. I have heavily used Dreamweaver CFeclipse with eclipse and now Coldfusion Builder.  What I found is this:  - This is Adobe's version of CFeclipse.  It's still pretty new and getting to later beta.  I switched to it about 6 months ago and haven't looked back.  It's got a lot of wizards including the ability to write your own plugins in CFML that will run right inside CFbuilder.  It's free right now on beta but will likely be pretty cheap like the first flex builder that came out. My Choice: Coldfusion Builder.  It doesn't mean the others aren't capable but you'll spend the least amoutn of time getting setup and maintaining your plugins etc.   Since I had paid for and used Dreamweaver for a lot of years (Eclipse was generally sluggish sometimes on PCs' a while back until the excess of ram + cpu today) spending to have an adobe maintained copy of eclipse is okay with me.

129,text editor - Multiple Language IDE ,I've been using Notepad++ for years and although it is comfortable I am feeling the need to move up into the IDE world for various reasons which I'll outline below. I am looking for IDE recommendations for someone who works in multiple languages on a daily basis - I am currently looking at Eclipse and Netbeans but willing to consider any option. The reason I have not made the switch to a full-fledged IDE yet is because they feel so bloated they are slow to load and eat up a ton of memory. Recently I have been working on an astronomical number of projects (5-6 at work upwards of 10 personally) in a variety of languages (Python PHP Ruby Java Javascript xHTML CSS TorqueScript to name a few). These are just the languages I am using on a daily basis - although I don't expect to find an IDE that will meet all the demands of these languages (especially the more obscure TorqueScript on the list). So what would you recommend for someone who needs a fast configurable IDE that offers support for a variety of languages syntax highlighting (preferably with various color schemes) project organization/browsing Intellisense-ish code completion? I forgot to mention I am primarily targetting the Windows environment here - when I'm on my Xubuntu machine (minimally) Geany works fine for what I need to accomplish.I would recommend Eclipse as the closest match for the multi-language requirements. There are IDEs that possibly shine better for a given language (e.g. I prefer IntelliJ for Java) but none that have such a broad coverage of multiple languages. As far as memory/bloat it's a price you pay for the convenience that an IDE provides. The  covers a whole pool of languages and above all that you get a free VM with root access. Definitely worth checking out.
141,Best IDE for Perl 5 ,"I have a good experience with Bash shell scripting and am now moving to Perl. What is the best IDE for Perl 5? Will Perl 6 kill Perl 5? Or will Perl 5 always be alive?""Best"" is of course a matter of taste. Rather than ""best"" I'll answer this as ""what editor should I use for Perl if I don't already have a strong preference for an editor?"" I went on a short quest to answer this question for my students. What I recommend now is . This is the editor available on any Unix machine and you'll need to use it when you inevitably find yourself needing to edit files on a Unix machine. It is very powerful but also very baffling. Atom has rendered the rest of this answer obsolete. ). I don't know of any of my clients using Perl6 and given this and the extant documentation for Perl5 I would reach for Perl5 with little fear of being overtaken in the near future. You can check EPIC plugin for Eclipse. Far from having all features but you can do some debug and use Eclipse feature quite easily. You can go safely with Perl 5. Perl 6 is a new language still being worked on and its date of release is unknown so you shouldn't care about it for now."
143,Good IDE for HTML ,"I recently started to learn HTML from Code Academy. I have searched around a bit but I have not been able to find a good IDE that closely resembles the one used in the Code Academy course. If anyone has any suggestions please tell me. I'm just looking for an IDE that resembles the one used in the Code Academy course.Most devs I know use Sublime Text me personally I use a variety of tools depending on what I'm working on. Which are good however are as always with this type of question subject to opinion. What's good for me may not suit you where as something I hate may be the perfect tool for you. One bit of advice I will give you though learn to code raw before you go looking for an editor that has all the bells and whistles and does stuff for you. If your just starting out and your learning HTML one of the worst things IMHO that you can do is to use an editor that writes the code for you. I've trained a LOT of developers over the years and by far the ones that always performed the worst where the ones that used automated tools early in their training. If you learn to write code using a very minimalist editor then you'll quickly grow to understand what your writing better rather than thinking ""oh my editor will do this for me and I can look it up later"" For me personally I have no problems logging into a Linux server at the command line and using something like midnight commander to live edit web pages in real time on a live web site :-) If I want the bells and whistles and I'm on windows then Visual Studio is often my tool of choice if I'm on Linux at a desktop then often Net beans. Every application has it's pros and cons the best way to find your perfect tool is to just try a few and see how you feel it's like buying a new pair of shoes unless you try them you'll never know if their going to fit or not. For HTML and such I really like Sublime Text ("
145,c++ - IDE for Objective C ,What are the IDE's or development tools best suited for projects involving Objective C C and C++?  Is there a common IDE which would support all the three languages. If you are using Objective-C for macos or iphone apps it seems there is no way around 
148,open source - Opensource/free HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript IDE? ,What is the best open source/free HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript IDE? Thank you!!!Most of the time when I write code I am programming C# applications using Visual Studio which is my favorite IDE. However when it comes to Javascript VS is quite poor. It does not support collapse to definitions (AKA code folding in other IDEs / editors) does not support code outlining and also has a very primitive and most of the times useless autocomplete. Because of that at some point I have started to search alternative tools for JS programming and the best I came across was . It also has support for HTML and CSS (as well as for some server side languages like Ruby PHP Phyton) but I have only used it for JS and that is an area where it shines. It has very good code outlining and one of the best autocomplete implementations I have ever seen for Javascript (even thought it is still improvable). Aptana Studio is based Eclipse and is available as a plugin or as a full package version. On their site they are saying that the next version is going to totally independent from Eclipse which would make it a lot more light weight and more performant. However the current Beta version of Aptana Studio 3 is still based on Eclipse. You can find more on Aptana Studio 3 on the official page: .This also may help: an extensive  after few years with Aptana... I enjoy using it.
149,What is the best IDE for PHP? ,I'm a PHP developer and now I use  and several others but I'm not really decided they all look nice enough but a bit complicated. I'm sure it'll all get easy once I get used to it but I don't want to waste my time. This is what I'm looking for:Are you sure you're looking for an IDE?  The features you're describing along with the impression of being too complicated that you got from e.g. Aptana suggest that perhaps all you really want is a good editor with syntax highlighting and integration with some common workflow tools.  For this there are tons of options. I've used .He says it here:  would be my second choice. My only problem with Komodo is that the autocomplete is not as good. With properly structured apps where you use phpDoc to document return types etc. it should be alright. But I work on a project that doesn't really do that and Komodo can't read across files to know that $user is a User object for example. Personally everything that is based uppon Eclipse or NetBeans is an overkill the GUI is crap and the performance is soooo slow compared to other alternatives. If you're willing to pay I would suggest Zend IDE (version 5.5 not 6 because it's based on Eclipse) and EditPlus for a more lightweight yet powerfull code editor. If you're looking for free alternatives or if you code in other languages other than PHP OpenKomodo is a really nice IDE with almost all the features (no SVN neither CVS) that you require the only con I see about OpenKomodo is that sometimes it messes my code indentation but then again I don't use it on a very regular basis. As for a free lightweight alternative: Notepad++. =) My personal preference is Eclipse (with various plug-ins) as I am developing in several languages (PHP Java and Ruby) and this way I am always used to interface and keyboard shortcuts. This is not a minor thing as you become very productive this way. I haven't used Aptana but will (hopefully) soon - it does look interesting though.For others IDEs I have used: jEdit (for little Java) Notepad++ (still for some scripting and short test code runs).And for the features You asked: Eclipse support many source code version servers ( is as close to Eclipse java power as it could get. Eclipse PDT is much weaker (last time I checked). I'm using PHPDesigner but I will go for Eclipse PDT. I was always against Eclipse until few months ago when I have one Java project to finish... Great IDE Now I can't imagine one day without Eclipse. :) Have you tried NetBeans 6? Zend Studio and NetBeans 6 are the best IDEs with PHP support you'll come across and NetBeans is free.

160,php - PHPDoc type hinting for array of objects? ,"So in PHPDoc one can specify  doesn't seem to be valid for example. The best you can do is say I do that a lot in Zend Studio. Don't know about other editors but it ought to work. In the PhpStorm IDE from JetBrains you can use  is not necessary. . I prefer to read and write clean code - as outlined in ""Clean Code"" by Robert C. Martin.When following his credo you should not require the developer (as user of your API) to know the (internal) structure of your array.  The API user may ask: Is that an array with one dimension only? Are the objects spread around on all levels of a multi dimensional array? How many nested loops (foreach etc.) do i need to access all objects? What type of objects are ""stored"" in that array? As you outlined you want to use that array (which contains objects) as a one dimensional array.  As outlined by Nishi you can use: for that.  But again: be aware - this is not a standard docblock notation. This notation was introduced by some IDE producers.  Okay okay as a developer you know that ""[]"" is tied to an array in PHP. But what do a ""something[]"" mean in normal PHP context? ""[]"" means: create new element within ""something"". The new element could be everything. But what you want to express is: array of objects with the same type and itÂ´s exact type. As you can see the IDE producer introduces a new context. A new context you had to learn. A new context other PHP developers had to learn (to understand your docblocks). Bad style (!). Because your array do have one dimension you maybe want to call that ""array of objects"" a ""list"". Be aware that ""list"" has a very special meaning in other programming languages. It would be mutch better to call it ""collection"" for example. Remember: you use a programming language that enables you all options of OOP.Use a class instead of an array and make your class traversable like an array. E.g.: Or if you want to store the internal objects on different levels within an multi dimensional array/object structure: This solution replaces your array by an object of type ""orderCollection"" but do not enable code completion within your IDE so far. Okay. Next step: Implement the methods that are introduced by the interface with docblocks - particular:  Do not forget to use type hinting for: This solution stops introducing a lot of: all over your code files (e.g. within loops) as Zahymaka confirmed with her/his answer. Your API user is not forced to introduce that docblocks to have code completion. To have @return on only one place reduces the redundancy (@var) as mutch as possible. Sprinkle ""docBlocks with @var"" would make your code worst readable. Finaly you are done. Looks hard to achive? Looks like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Not realy since you are familiar with that interfaces and with clean code. Remember: your source code is written once / read many. If code completion of your IDE do not work with this approach switch to a better one (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA PhpStorm Netbeans) or file a feature request on the issue tracker of your IDE producer. Thanks to Christian Weiss (from Germany) for being my trainer and for teaching me such a great stuff. PS: Meet me and him on XING.  Now usage of classes: Once again: I suspect not all IDE support it but PhpStorm does. Try yours post in comment the results! I know I'm late to the party but I've been working on this problem recently.  I hope someone sees this because the accepted answer although correct is > the best way you can do this.  Not in PHPStorm at least I haven't tested NetBeans though. The best way involves extending the ArrayIterator class rather than using native array types.  This allows you to type hint at a class-level rather than at an instance-level meaning you only have to PHPDoc once not throughout your code (which is not only messy and violates DRY but can also be problematic when it comes to refactoring - PHPStorm has a habit of missing PHPDoc when refactoring) See code below: The key here is the PHPDoc  to signify ""an array of Foo's"" but it's not supported by IDE's. I've found something which is working it can save lives !"
161,macos - Good C IDE for Mac? ,"I've just started a job where I'm programming in C on a Mac which is my first experience using a Mac for development. For now I'm using Xcode as my editor then using make/gcc/svn at the command line for compiling and source control. Is there a good full featured IDE out there for Macs that will compile C code (something comparable to VS would be ideal) or should I stick with these low level tools? EDIT: so I called Xcode a ""low level tool"" because I was under the impression that it was just a text editor for code like gvim. I will definitely look into it's compiling/source control features.You can also try  Xcode can manage project and compile for you as any IDE. But if you're familiar with CLI I would recommand you to use a good editor and your usual build tools. Emacs and vim are available on os x (using xcode just for its editor is not ideal). Many mac dev love the excellent TextMate editor but it is not a free (as in freedom) software. Obviously 'good' is a subjective decision but Xcode 3.2 is certainly up to par with what you can do in VisualStudio (if one considers VS good is another thing of course).   I have a project with 250000+ lines of codes 10 dylibs helpfile all in an SVN (Perforce) etc. and hardly ever go outside Xcode. Xcode has a few peculiar ways to do some things and the debugger is not quite as powerful as the current one in VisualStudio but overall there's hardly anything you can not do from within the IDE (and the options to adjust the shortcuts within the IDE Debugger and Editor to your needs are really awesome).

162,php - Popping the IDE cherry ,Although I've been a developer for years I've never used a PHP IDE - I've always just used a decent editor. What am I missing? I generally code on local servers so I can debug as if my code were running on my own machine I have code highlighting I have shortcuts set up to look up function names and so on. Is it worth investing the time in learning to use a full IDE? Is it worth investing the money in purchasing one? Looking at (the slightly aging)  I would probably go for PhpDesigner or possibly Eclipse.Consider  is a veteran in the IDE field. It's not free but it's not expensive either - yet. Has a long trial period and you can use it afterwards - it just closes every half an hour but that's it. phped from nusphere. We prefer it over zend). Regards rbo i've been using nuSphere netbeans and eclipse for a while and of these three i find netbeans the most usefull. it doesn't hang as often as eclipse does and it has a lot of shortcuts for project browsing. i find myself browsing the projects a lot faster using netbeans than the other 2 and it has a lot of features you most likely won't use but you can disable them so they won't eat up resources. I tried PHPed and nusphere debugger and it works really good too. I prefer PHPed instead NetBeans is lightweight you can encode your php scripts for distribution nusphere has php express too an extension to execute php scripts encoded with nucoder inside PHPEd.

The only IDE i've used before is eclipse so maybe I'm not thinking of an IDE the right way but I'm expecting something kind of like eclipse.(>) I think our installation instructions are quite clear but I repeat them here for you again: If you are new to Python or the Scientific Python ecosystem we  recommend you to install and use . It comes with Spyder and all its dependencies along with the most important Python scientific libraries (i.e. Numpy Pandas Matplotlib IPython etc) in a single easy to use environment. After installing Anaconda you need to open the Anaconda Navigator (using Spotlight) and run Spyder from there. Another option is to open  but you should really remove what you installed with it and use Anaconda instead. As we said in our installation instructions too: We also support pip but please be aware that pip installations are for advanced users with good knowledge of all Spyder dependencies. This clearly seems to be not your case.

192,Alternative SilkTest IDE ,"Coming from Eclipse there are many features that simply do not exist in the SilkTest IDE. My question is this: Is there an alternative IDE to SilkTest that I could use to maintain our SilkTest scripts? Something that can offer some of the power that Eclipse and many other mainstream IDEs bring to the table? Some of the power I'm referring to is: If the answer is ""No"" that's acceptable and is what I expect but I will wait for a short time to give others the opportunity to answer. Additionally we have the 2009 license of SilkTest. If these features are available in newer versions of the IDE that's also an acceptable answer. Thank you.For 4Test (SilkTest's classic scripting language) the answer is 'No'.  However for some time there are Silk4J and Silk4Net around which allow you to create your test scripts in either Eclipse or Visual Studio using Java or a .Net language. You can then use all the features the IDEs provide. Note:I work for Borland on the SilkTest team so my answers are probably biased."

194,java - Error: Could not find or load main class in intelliJ IDE ,"I'm a beginner in Java and am trying to run my code using IntelliJ that I just installed as my IDE with JDK 1.7.  The following piece of code keeps does not even compile and keeps giving me the error: Is there any change that i have to make in the compiler settings?? Or is it the code.This might help: 1) ""Build"" menu -&gt; """".Sometimes Intellij doesn't rewrite the classes because they already exist this way you ask Intellij to rewrite everything. 2) ""Run"" menu -&gt; """".  For me the solution was to fix the output directory under project settings.  Before I was using just ""target"" for the Project compiler output.  Instead I updated it to have a full path e.g. D:\dev\sigplusjava2_68\target If none of above answers didn't work for you just close your intelliJ IDE and remove intelliJ IDE file and folder from root of project:  Then open project with intelliJ. It must work now. I had this problem and I tried everything under the sun that I could think of and on this site.  None of my Java classes were being picked up after I pulled from a remote branch. All the classes had red Js by their names in the Project Hierarchy not blue Cs. In the end I tried to follow this tutorial and a few steps in tried something not described and fixed the issue: Now hit >  : I have encountered this problem with intellij :I have a maven multi-module project the problem is that i runing a class which not exist the  module within the configuration so my problem is fixed by setting the right module (""edit configuration"" -&gt; ""use class of module"")  may this help you Invalidate cache and restart your intellij it worked for me. I know this was asked a while ago but I was just stumbling over this issue and thought my findings might help others. As pointed out the error message is basically a result of the out folder. That's because when you're trying to run the program it compiles the code first and puts the compiled result to the out location and then it tries to load the compiled code from the out location. If the compiled code is not in the location expected you'll get the error.  The point I'm particularly wanting to share is that some times the code is not compiled (built) even though your run configuration specifies ""Build"" in the ""Before launch"" section of the configuration panel.  When can this happen? One situation that can cause this to happen is if you're using modules and you manually delete the module out directory. For example if I have a module named ""foo"" there should be a directory named foo under out/production. If you manually delete it the build system may not know that it needs to be rebuilt.  Even worse if you select Build | Build module 'foo' it still may not rebuild the module. If that's the case you should select a file in the module for example 'bar.java' and then select Build | Recompile 'bar.java'. Now the out directory out/production/foo should be restored.  Since IntelliJ typically knows about any changes going on this surprised me and took me a little time to figure out so I thought I'd share.  I have faced such problems when the class is in the default folder i.e. when the class does not declare a package. So I guess using a package statement (eg. ) on top of the class should fix it. I had to mark the ""src"" folder as ""Sources"". After restarting IntelliJ and rebuilding the project I could run the project without further issues (see ).Edit: You can access the ""Project Structure"" tab via File-&gt;Project Structure or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S. Open Modules Tab (Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S). I had two modules under one project. I've solve the problem after removing the second redundant module (see screenshot). As others have noted you have to . IntelliJ could not find the main class even though everything was set up correctly.My solution: delete the  folder then restart IntelliJ. Follow these steps Yippee....your code will run:) For me the problem was a special character in the file path. IntelliJ allowed me to open the project however when I built/ran the project it couldn't locate the class any more because it was transforming the file path to remove the special character and therefore was looking in the wrong directory. To solve the problem I just removed the special character from the folder name my project was stored in and reopened the project in IntelliJ."
199,debugging - JavaScript IDE/Compiler ,"Now I hope some of you people will understand what I'm asking. I'm new to programming. I got introduced to JavaScript on Codecademy.com I use labs.codecademy.com for my JavaScript writing but it's limited. What IDE/Compiler can I use that's pretty simplistic in terms of being new to programming. Where I'm not surrounded by buttons that I don't know how to use yet. Does this even exist? A simple IDE?I think these two editors/IDEs are simple and good for beginners: More ""complicated"" but good javascript support: This is very subjective but nevertheless have look at this editors and choose what suites best for you. I hope I could help you. Notepad?  JavaScript doesn't have a compiler really.  Though there are ways of shrinking the code that some people call ""compiling"" but it isn't ""compiling"" in the strictest sense of the word. If you are looking for something JavaScript specific give  a try.  The personal license is $50 and I'm sure that while it will do more than you need right now it will grow with you. There is a 30 day trial. I was researching this exact question for my daughter. Like you she started learning JavaScript on Codecademy. She loves it but she is frequently frustrated when she doesn't understand why a program doesn't work. So I researched IDEs and debuggers and I read that Visual Studio has a debugger that is easy to use. But after installing 4 different versions I had to jump through lots of hoops to create a JavaScript project in Visual Studio Express 2013 and then I couldn't debug it. After a while I gave up and installed Eclipse. I have used Eclipse before and it's very powerful. I was originally looking for alternatives because I felt using Eclipse for JavaScript is kind of like using an airplane when all you need is a bicycle :) There are many versions and packages of Eclipse. I think this one might be the simplest to install:(Helios is a version and this specific package is for JavaScript developers) I actually used the latest version (Kepler). Unfortunately it doesn't have a package for JavaScript so I used the Java package:and then added JSDT: Yes Eclipse can be intimidating for a beginner but the good thing about Eclipse is that it works on multiple platforms you can find support for pretty much any language and it's free :) If you are serious about programming I recommend you invest a little time in learning how to use Eclipse. Let me know if this helps or if you have more questions."

204,Which Python IDE ,  Hi recently started looking at Python basically for scripting so far I've been doing exercises from the web which is OK. I'm using gEdit and its fine. but I'm curious to know what is a good IDE for python that will still allow me to discover. One of the things I'm used to in Visual Studio is code completioncode snippets and tips so when you type FOO then CTRL+SPACE you get to see what methodsproperties etc are available for FOO. You can select a method press F1 and get HELP on its usage. Really helps discovery and learning. Can anyone recommend a good IDE preferably FREE that works well on windows(Linux is optional) and has features such as code completioncode snippetscode tipsYou might want to try Vim or Eclipse.

209,c# - IDE Support for WinForms ,Hey guys I'm a newbie and I just wanted to know of the people who do Winforms on Visual studio at your place of work do your forms have IDE support. Because for some reason I don't have IDE support on 99% of the windows forms I'm working with. I mean I can not see anything on the design view except for errors is this the usual case in industry????Sorry WinForms is not broken for us (me). Check your code. Sometimes WinForms applications that were developed under Visual Sudio 2003 (or earlier) when upgraded to Visual Studio 2005 (or later) become unstable. Start with a new form and if the IDE (it is called a visual designer) works fine then think about re-creating the old forms from scratch with the newest VS installation. Are you using any 3rd party UI controls? Some have dll's for the design view to work and if you haven't installed the toolkit on your developer machine you might get errors like this.  One possible explanation for having errors on forms is licensing. If your company uses third-party controls on their forms they could cause errors when trying to display the forms on unlicensed machines. Another possible explanation for errors with third-party controls is simply installation. If you don't have the controls installed and referenced properly that could also cause errors. You could try to post some of the errors you have to another Stack Overflow question and perhaps the community could help you solve your errors.  Your question isn't clear! if the Visual Studio Designer not working well then re-install the IDE Or explain more... You should be able to view the forms in the design view. Always unless there is an error in code. In case the project is building you should get the same error (this is a runtime error) that you will generally get when you run the code.

224,eclipse - Help in writing a IDE ,"I m embarking on a difficult journey to create/replace a IDE for one of the middleware products from Bigblue. Thy have created a IDE based on eclipse and Its a PIA to use it and very very slow even on decent configuration machine. Problem is there is no alternative to this.But i m planning to create one.So to start off i need to write a GUI in C++. I m planning to use Qt for this.But i need to understand how eclipse generate aritifacts and such. There are some graphical elements in Eclipse IDE used by bigblue. I need to create exacltly those graphical elements in my IDE. So its basically writing a eclipse IDE only in C++  but for the middle ware product only. Any guidance  suggestions are most welcome.  I know i might fail in this endeavor but I would rather try and fail than just to complain about how slow the IDE is. Thanks all. Edit : I have been using the Eclipse IDE for 5 years provided by bigblue and its dead slow I have to use their version because it has customized environment for middleware tool.I m finally tired of it.:(Eclipse by itself isn't slow and Java is fairly fast so I have to think you would win by simply doing a better Eclipse plugin. If you don't believe me or if I'm wrong then I have to think the back-up plan is to write a plugin for a different IDE. Even VS has third-party plug-ins. You can try to optimize your running environment. Buy more RAM!  A development machine for Eclipse should have 4 GB RAM. Working with less is a waste of time. Optimize your Eclipse JVM parameters - lots of articles on that subject. I found that Eclipse works more smoothly on Mac OS X and Linux boxes than on Windows. My guess is that it is probably due to the superior memory management of Unix based OSs. Personally I often find myself running 2-3 instances of Eclipse on OS X and they are all running just fine. Do not judge the entire Eclipse ecosystem by your experience with a single IDE based on it. The Eclipse platform is not slow in itself and modern JVMs are pretty efficient (although a little memory hungry). If the IDE you are forced to use is slow and badly designed it is probably due to that particular IDE and not because of Eclipse itself. I have quite a few years of experience designing and implementing IDEs and I can tell you that if you embark on writing your own IDE you will need at least 3-4 people just to keep it up with the feature set found in Eclipse/Visual Studio/etc. If you write it only for your own use you will find that you get very little time over to do real work. Eclipse is a wonderful ""platform"" for developing our own IDE.  That way you don't need to worry too much about the mundane things and you can focus on what sets your IDE apart.  A good place to start is the   The only practical way to approach the problem as described in the OP is to write your IDE features as an extension to an existing IDE framework. For a full-featured IDE you'll probably be starting with one of the following: If you write your own IDE from scratch you'll spend all your time working on the core IDE and end up with a product not nearly as good as one based on an existing IDE. Use a profiler to guide your work and you'll find the extension plenty fast enough."
234,c# - Selenium IDE testscript to Selenium IDE ,I have a question. Is there anybody here who could at least give me an idea or a video perhaps on how to create a test script from Selenium IDE converting it into Selenium webdriver setting it up in the visual studio and successfully running it. Your help is highly appreciated.There are dozens and dozens of these videos already online. There is no point in using IDE. Go straight to webdriver. You must chose a language to write in first C#Java etc. If you don't know either of these it's best to study these first and then move on to Selenium webdriver. I suggest C#. You can use the Microsoft virtual academy to learn this from scratch.  Best of luck-Aaron
236,hex - Regarding HiTop5 IDE from Hitex ,I have a STM32 Performance stick for developing USB device.It comes along with HiTop5 IDE for software development and debugging. I have written programs and flashed into the microcontroller using the IDE. Now I want to use only the microcontroller and want to load the programs I have written using the IDE to it. There is a .htp file created to load the project once build is done and .elf created in the objects folder. But there seems to be no hex file created for me to load the program with other methods. I've searched the net on how to create a hex using this IDE. But didn't find any.  Has anybody used this IDE and know how to generate a hex file from it?Go to Project settings in Hitop IDE in the select the application of the project openedclick on the general box Check the create standard code box it will ask for intel hex or s format select intel hex option.Next time you build the project hex file will be generated.

Any solution?"

242,python - Vpython in Wing IDE ,"I am using Wing IDE and I have installed VIDLE with Vpython. VIDLE works fine but if I want to use it on Wing IDE somehow it can't import the visual module. It always gives an error ""No module named visual"". How can I import the visual module into the IDE? I thought maybe the problem lies in the version of the Vpython or the Python itself. The installed Vpython is for Python 2.7 (I've tried another one for 3.4 but the VIDLE wouldn't work with it). Both Python 2.7 and 3.4 are installed on the PC but I don't even know which one is taken as default on the IDE. So if this really has something to do with the version how can I change the Python path on Wing IDE? Sorry I am quite new in Python and I've looked everywhere but didn't come to any helpful answer. Thank you in advance."

257,terminology - confused with the IDE concept ,this question though has nothing to do with the programming stuff gets me bugged while I try to delve deeper a bit. I am confused with what this IDE means. somewhere it says its an editor or somewhere like its some PHP editor. I use dreamweaver normally and notepad ++ occasionally .. Is this what IDE is ? or is that I have misunderstood things.??An integrated development environment is generally a whole bunch of tools integrated into one. This includes editor compiler debugger and whatever other tools you may want to add. Back in pre-history we used to use an editor to edit the files then we would exit and use a compiler then a linker to produce the final product (actually when I first started we used punch cards and 80x25 data entry sheets and handed them to data entry operators for input into the computer but I don't want to bore the youngsters among you). Nowadays we just press the  key or if you use Emacs Â Â Â Â Â 
258,Best IDE for developing Java Desktop Applications ,I've been developing Java Web apps using Eclipse as the IDE. Planning to start developing a desktop app based on Java.  Can someone suggest the best IDE for developing Java based desktop apps? (One that would have drag drop for building the interface like Visual Studio)I recommend   Response to RTFM messages:I agree reading the manual is a good way to learn more about the tool. The OP is trying to figure out a few tools to learn more in depth and finally zero in on one (or a subset to meet varying requirements). To get to the first list before reading the accompanying manuals one would require some directions and help based on experience. If you had to read manuals of all related tools before identifying the tool that meets your requirement a new tool would have come in or your project would have gone past you! Response to original question on best IDE based editor: In some ways it doesn't matter which tool you use as long as you put the effort into learning it in depth. Know your tools! Read the Free Manual! In practice: you would want to pick Eclipse for SWT and Netbeans for Swing (Matisse is great when you are getting started). I haven't used IntelliJ but I am sure it is excellent. A couple of years ago I used Eclipse with  which I found very useful. I liked the code that it generated - it was really easy to take that and add the extra functionality I needed. if you aim for windows only than Visual studio is the best choice.For multiple platforms Mono is very good and it does not have java's .Of course you would use C# rather than Java if going with Mono or VS.
259,emacs - Which IDE are CLISP Programmers using? ,I noticed how SLIME (lisp development package for Emacs) does not come with a frame-source-location function for CLISP so you can't automagically jump to a source location when inside the debugger. Given that I figured CLISP users must be using some other IDE (though I guess IDE is a little bit misleading here maybe they're just using a different Emacs package). So what IDE/Emacs package are CLISP programmers using?I think Emacs and SLIME is still what those people use.
260,debugging - IronPython embedded IDE ,"I'd like to use embedded IronPython as a way of allowing users to script / extend my app. Running the scripts is easy enough but I also need to provide some sort of IDE or editor as well - this is the bit I'm not sure how to do. As far as I can see I have only a few options: The trouble with options 1. and 2. is that obviously they are a lot of work! (And will most likely be far inferior to ""real"" IDEs) - I was kind of hoping that someone else might have written an IronPython IDE that I could extend and embed in my app but I've had no such luck. Option 3. would be my preference - I'd imagine that I would save my script to a temporary file and then start the IDE with the path to my file as a parameter.  The problem is that in order to be able to test / run the scripts I need to set up some environmental objects beforehand - this makes testing and debugging the scripts from an external IDE rather cumbersome. I don't mind insisting that only certain IDEs are supported (i.e. Visual Studio) and so I was kind of thinking I could write out a custom MSBuild file that ensured that the environment was all set up correctly when someone pressed F5 but then I realised I was starting to be silly.  The other option I considered was if there were any open source IDEs that I could canibalise into embedded script editor. Or alternatively is there another soltion that I'm missing?The  is open source and it already has support for Python (but not IronPython AFAIK) so I imagine that might get you pretty close to what you want with some modifications.  Licensing is pretty liberal (LGPLv2 and MIT)."
263,Best IDE for Grails 1.1.X development ,I've been on a frustrating quest to find an IDE which provides reasonable support for Grails 1.1 development. My minimum requirements are: Here's a rundown of my experience so far Using the latest plugins available from the update site Eclipse's support for Groovy/Grails is truly pathetic. It provides little more than code completion and spurious errors As soon as I imported the project NetBeans began scanning it. The Navigator view was waiting for the scanning to finish before showing it's contents. About 20 minutes later both the Navigator view and I were still waiting. Also support for code completion on dynamic finders is poor and for some reason it copied all the plugins into $PROJECT_ROOT/web-app/plugins.  Although the general consensus is that IntelliJ is the best IDE for Groovy/Grails . The root cause of the problem appears to be the change in the location of the plugins folder. IntelliJ is unable to build the app because it can't find classes I'm importing from plugins even though those plugins are listed in application.properties So my question (finally) is whether anyone has found an IDE (not TextMate or Vim) that works with Grails 1.1.X when the plugin folder is in it's default location i.e. under $HOME/.grails/1.1.X/plugins? If so I'd be really grateful for information about: ThanksDonI'm unclear on which version of IntelliJ  IDEA the author of that blog post tested tha didn't work with Grails 1.1.1.   Idea 8.1.2 works very well for me on OSX with Grails 1.1 and 1.1.1.  Grails is installed under /Developer/grails-1.1.1 (with a symlink at /Developer/grails ) and the plugins are in the ~/.grails/1.1.1/plugins directory.    I didn't have to install any extra Idea plugins. What I did have to do was tell it where the plugins were and install the missing ones once I had upgraded to 1.1.1.  IDEA's grails integration can even recognize the plugins from the Grails repository and install them from the IDE. . The Spring Tools Suite is also an excellent choice for grails/groovy development. I use it and do not have any cause for regret. I've been using Netbeans 6.7 for some time and it's very slow the code completion rarely works. Basically I'm using it as an editor and to format my code. I used the EAP version of IDEA 8.1 and it was really nice - very easy to setup and develop in compared to the other IDEs.  Sorry I don't remember exactly how to import an existing project but it was fairly straight forward. If cost is not an issue then IDEA would probably be the best choice. I use STS (SpringSource Toolkit) I like it better than Intellij or Netbeans. I am using 2.3.3.M2

270,php - Lightweight IDE for Linux ,Even though I have a robust and fast computer (Pentium Dual Core 2.0 with 2Gb RAM) I'm always searching for lightweight software to have on it so it runs fast even when many apps are up and running simultaneously. On the last few weeks I've been migrating gradually to Linux and want to install a free lightweight yet useful IDE to program on C++ and PHP.  Syntax highlighting and code completion tips are must-haves. (or Emacs varying on religion) will always be my first answer to this question over any point-and-click IDE.As they write in  for Gtk/Gnome for KDE? Again it's a 'smart editor' rather than an IDE.  Seems to know how to handle most languages and once its started it is pretty smart still Java but less resource hungry than Netbeans and Eclipse. I would say ).

284,Making Source writable from the Delphi IDE ,"Is it possible to make readonly source code (eg. .pas &amp; .dfm) writable from within the Delphi IDE?  The right click option to make files Readonly/Writable within the IDE doesn't change the properties on the file system.  Is there an IDE extension or similar that can achieve this? A way to do this without having to integrate a source control system would be preferable.  I am using Delphi XE and Delphi 6. Thanks! sseThis is how I would do it. Create a new package which will be installed into the IDE at designtime. If you have an existing package handy then you could carry on using it. Make sure the package  clause. Now add the following unit to your package. When you compile and install this package you will now have a new menu item on the File menu which both clears the read-only flag in the input buffer and makes the file writeable. You can call a .bat file from the tools menu.  So you could write a .bat file to do the work for  you and call it with $EDNAME as the parameter.Your .bat file should see the filename as %1.  Then you'd need a little bit of logic to change the read-only flag (attrib command?) and then see if there is a .dfm and do that one as well. You could also (obviously) make a Delphi command-line app to do this if you're not comfortable with .bat files.   This idea inspired by this article that talks about how to use a .bat file to integrate SVN commands with the Delphi tools menu: Another idea: Just add an option to the tools menu: ""open command prompt here"". It lets you do all sorts of things from the command line such as running the attrib command. Add a new entry to the Tools menu and use these settings: Also make yourself an ""Open Folder Here"" entry:"
288,Liferay IDE Alternatives ,I am using Liferay Developer Studio for theme development and as a frontend developer I am not impress with the tool's performance. Below are few reasons I am looking for alternative IDE compatible for Liferay development. I am sure there are many others too faced same issues which actually makes the development slower. This question is not against the Liferay of course it's a great enterprise level CMS tool. But yes looking for alternate IDE with best compatibility for the purpose. Thanks in advance.You can use  as editor.  Please refere to those links : 1 -  You can use any IDE you want. The only one difference between LiferayIDE and others IDEs is you can avoid using BladeCLI by hands. And nothing can stop you to use another IDE build you project with maven or gradle and then continue to develop. If you are a front-end developer you really should use Gulp and Yo. First time you'll feel yourself confused a bit but after short period of time you'll understand all benefits.

I have just downloaded Ruby from  because I thought it might be a cool language to learn but I can't find where the IDE is in the folder is there an IDE with it or not? If so can anyone tell me where it is?Ruby is just the interpreter and doesn't provide any IDE. You can use the editor of your choice like  The state of Ruby IDEs in 2016 is very sad the original question does not deserve to be rated down as it addresses a valid point. Except Intellij Rubymine there is no actively maintained fully featured IDE available for Ruby that supports Intellisense (or comparable functionality) and fast visual debugging. Unless you shell out more than USD200 in the first year and still more than USD100 each subsequent year to Intellij you'll have to do with Emacs Vi(m) Atom Visual Studio Code etc. like solutions for source code editing without Intellisense support and rely on rdebug ruby-debug-ide (super slow!) or my favorite debugging console: pry. I am hoping for someone to enable Intellisense for Ruby in Visual Studio Code and provide a decent debugging plugin there. There are many IDEs which support Ruby. There is Ruby Mine from Intellij Netbeans has a Ruby setting. Atom has a Ruby setting and is my favorite right now. I'm sure Visual Studio and Visual Studio code both have Ruby plugins.  Typically programming languages do not come with a dedicated IDE because IDEs only help you a little technically you can just use Notepad. So it's up to you to find one that you like.

I do not know which IDE is best suitable for codeingiter framework. is there any one who can help me in this regard. thanks.If you want a simple IDE you can go for  just use Google for the others). There is many IDE Editor available in market for development but PHP Storm and Sublime text Editor is best for PHP Development I found netbeans the best IDE for php development so far. It has got nice auto-completion feature debugging utility and most importantly easy to use version controll system to list some. Before I've used Zend Studio for coding but then I've moved to the Netbeans as far as it's the best IDE for me with very useful plug-ins such as svn git etc... and auto code format functionality is very useful to make your code neat and improve the readability of your code.

338,IDE for PHP with Visual Designer? ,"Im new to PHP..I commonly see online that many PHP developers like to code php in simple notepad.. however   its always nice to use an IDE which helps the user being more productive by making fewer mistakes and writing good code. My Question is ""WHICH IS THE BEST IDE FOR DEVELOPMENT IN PHP?"" Im looking for a PHP IDE which provides good:- For me its important to have a visual designer in an IDE. Various IDE's dont have this such as Netbeans. Also is there any way to develop PHP applications in Visual Studio? (without/with using VS add-on)First of all I dont like to say ""I prefer Notepad"". It is just a lie and foolishness. Notepad is good for students who want to learn very basic. For an experienced programmer it is wasting of time like saying MSDOS is better than Windows7 . :D In my line of work I have used Eclipse NuSphere phpED Netbeans Dreamveawer PHPDesigner PSPad UltraEdit and Notepad as well. Among them Dreamveawer has the Visual Designer but for PHP I dont like it much. Eclipse Netbeans PHPDesigner and NuSphere phpED are my best choice for PHP coding. I like the code completion feature of them. I suggest you can do the design part with Dreamveawer (DV is best for Visual Designing for me). Then you can use another IDE for PHP Coding. Eclipse &amp; Netbeans are both doing a nice job and are free. :) For designing you can use Dreamweaver etc and then later embedd PHP code  Use -markkoberlein I user .  About your requests: My experience with ide:s is that almost every ide out there is realy good but they allmoust allways lack in som functionality. For instance:PHPEdit is the only ide that has good support for sitedebugging with . I think is a great ide and ther's also a personal lisence for opensource projects d.s. Expression Web 4 isn't the most robust for PHP but it's got the HTML and CSS (visually) down pretty well. Doesn't have the ""Live View"" of DW though. I completely recommend you try PHPStorm. It doesn't have the visual features of DW but it excels in PHP. Debugging is easy to set up. It does language injection (autocompleting HTML in PHP statement for example) which almost no other IDE does. It pretty light on it's feet and is very extensible.  For design view - drag and drop components onto a form - take a look at Embarcadero's HTML5 builder.     Set form and component properties write PHP and JavaScript Events.Forms for visual components and a hidden ""datamodule"" form for database connection query and table components to work out your data logic.     This upgrades and renames their RadPHP product which was principally for building PHP/javascript browser applications - a sort of Visual Studio for the PHP language - and adds development for mobile devices with this upgrade.Lots of features but only shows those relevant to whether you are designing coding or debugging to keep it simple.     Gives easy intuitive and quick results for the novice (like me!) and rapid development for experts. The hype is about mobile but is still an awesome web development tool - and not expensive compared with other editors.  Sorry if this sounds like a sales pitch but the IDE deserves to be better known."

I'm interested in working with Julia but unfortunately I'm having trouble in finding a program that has a ""not bad"" Julia debugger as RStudio does for R. I'm interested in an IDE to use in a mac in an offline way. Thank youPS: I've checked other messages over the web but I just found 2014's messages  is the Julia debugger. Pretty soon (next week?) the Juno developers will release a new version of Juno which has Gallium integrated into their IDE. This requires Julia v0.5. While there's still a ways to go this sounds like what you're looking for."

345,eclipse - Installing ANTLR IDE with Aptana ,I'm trying to install Antlr IDE with Aptana and I got this error log from the Update Manager. What exactly is going on?From what I see ANTLR IDE is based on Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) while Aptana Studio stand-alone is shipped with Eclipse 3.6. That's probably the reason you are getting this installation issue. You can install Aptana Studio as a plugin on top of Eclipse 3.7 and then install ANTLR IDE as well. Checkout the  (Aptana Studio tab) for the Studio's update site. Cheers As a side note... I was hesitated helping you out. You have 0% acceptance rate so take this into attention. Others may not help.
348,terminology - Java Framework IDE ,Hi anybody please tell me the difference between IDE and a FRAMEWORK suppose that am using eclipse (for java) by default which framework am following.IDE Stands for Integrated Development Environment and is a tool that allows you to program in a certain language and usually includes an integrated compiler debugger syntax highlighting and various other tools that allow you to develop applications quicker. E.g. Eclipse IDE Visual Studio Netbeans IDE. A framework is a library or set of classes that makes it easier to implement a certain type of application and is usually deployed with your application. It usually provides a structure that you need to adhere to and various helper classes. E.g. Spring Framework .Net MVC Struts etc. IDE is the development environment the editor where you would normally write code. It also might include a compiler debugger ... A framework is a set of reusable libraries or classes which you could use in your code. Some IDE's (eclipse netbeans) offer a > a framework i.e. you follow its rules enjoy its benefits and suffer its limitations (although a good framework offers extension points to minimise these).  Contrast this with a library which is a collection of code units (e.g. functions classes etc.) from which you draw as necessary but without constraining the structure of your own code. Using a framework is a bigger architectural decision than using a library. A typical enterprise project will use one or more frameworks and several libraries.
352,cil - IDE for MSIL ,There's any number of questions about MSIL on SO but none that directly answer this. I've been using  which does have a syntax definition file for MSIL and then using ILASM in a command prompt window. I did find a reference to ILIDE but the link is broken. Is there an IDE or add-on / plugin to Visual Studio / Eclipse for MSIL that allows syntax highlighting intellisense code completion debugging etc.?Use  (note : strangely some links to ilide are broken some of them even mentioning earlier links that are broken  but then supply a link that's broken too.  I was able to dowload it and Installed it succesfully from the link above though). further   : . IIRC Visual Studio will give you debugging if you assemble with /debug.  I think MS had a demo or sample of some VS plugin that helped a bit with IL. I'm not sure what it was named or if it was released.
353,IDE for Ruby on Rails ,"What is the new best IDE for ruby on rails development? I have used Komodo Edit and now using Netbeans 6.9.1""Best"" is subjective. I find IntelliJ to be the overall winner IDE-wise. I use Sublime Text 2 for non-IDE Rails development. Co-workers tends towards Vim. "

I know what they have PyCharm for Python) But in PHPStom I used a connection to a remove server) But PyCharm not have it( My Python project is on remote server... Which IDE you advise?
362,Why do we use WebDriver instead of Selenium IDE? ,Why can't we just record all of our test cases in  and run it in WebDriver with Eclipse? I need a clear explanation as I am very much confused in using WebDriver! And can anyone please explain why IDE recorded scripts fail in WebDriver?why cant we just record all of our test cases in IDE export it to java/webdriver and run it in webdriver Great question and here is the answer: Selenium IDE is a Record and Playback tool which is very easy to use but it's very unreliable.  Record and playback is typically a frowned upon in web applications.  Since web applications are frequently changed the IDE is not an ideal solution for a production environment because of the maintenance nightmare that may arise. Let me give you a practical example.  You record your test and you find an element with a dynamic ID.  Sure we can import it into eclipse but what happens when that test starts failing down the road? why not simply make your test agile and independent to catch these in the first place. It also boils down to your principles of test automation.  Test automation in MY opinion (and several other professionals) believe that test automation should be approached from a programming perspective.  Programmers should write the tests and maintain the tests.  Ideally your quality assurance personnel should be trained to write and maintain their own tests. So again back to your question the IDE is designed to be a quick solution to automation NOT a solution to a full regression suite.   And can anyone please explain why IDE recorded scripts fail in Webdriver? I haven't used the IDE in a while but the reason they fail is because the scripts that are exported are simply the  not an entire java file.  This also is because Selenium IDE exportations are supposed to be agnostic when it comes to how to run your test.  Say I'm a user of jUnit.. what if Selenium IDE exported it to TestNG all the time?  That wouldn't be fair.. honestly i'd rather create my own tests than changing that one line every single time i create my test file. You may read the full text of a research conducted called Why do Record/Replay Testsof Web Applications Break?For a Maven integration of flow controls command/aliases/macros used by Selenium IDE and Maven's SureFire test plugin see: for some examples. We've also used our selenium test cases for load testing with Soasta - WebDriver allows simple IDE tests to be used in many different contexts. Because when the complexity of your code will increase it will be difficult for you to manage it using IDE. Maintenance of your scripts will be difficult using IDE. Also Exporting test cases from IDE to webdriver is not 100% reliable. Other people have said a lot of helpful answers. One thing that is missing is that if you write code instead of using the IDE you have the power to make changes to the database. It depends on the website you are testing how useful this is but here are some useful examples I've experienced. In one case the website had multiple sections of a class. One of our tests was merging these sections into one. The IDE couldn't do this. But with webdriver we can add all of our test data into the database perform the merge and then remove the data from the database.  Another advantage that webdriver has is Selenium Grid. With Grid you can run your tests in parallel and on multiple browsers. This makes your testing run faster and you can more thoroughly test the code. 
367,React Native online IDE ,I'm interested in learning React Native however I have old amd computer which can't run Anroid Simulator. Is there any online IDE with android emulator for React Native? I would like to be able to compile app.I know I can run it on AWS but unfortunately I don't have credit card. I can pay with paypal.You can run it from snack.io. From your browser exactly your will get a simulator and an editor. However you can run projects only created in your snack account. CHECK OUT expo.com before you proceed.
368,IDE Plugin to handle Qooxdoo syntax ,does anyone know about an IDE or eventually a (preferrably Aptana) IDE plug-in which adds support for Qooxdoo framework? Thanks.Spket IDE has autocompletion support for qooxdoo:  Edit: Spket actually works fine with newer qooxdoo versions just create a profile using a qooxdoo 1.3 SDK folder as shown in the linked page.
373,Why use an IDE? ,"This may be too opinionated but what I'm trying to understand why some companies mandate the use of an IDE. In college all I used was vim although on occasion I used netbeans for use with Java. Netbeans was nice because it did code completion and had some nice templates for configuration of some the stranger services I tried.  Now that my friends are working at big companies they are telling me that they are required to use eclipse or visual studio but no one can seem to give a good reason why. Can someone explain to me why companies force their developers into restricted development environments?If you're good at using vim and know everything there is to know about it then there is no reason to switch to an IDE. That said many IDEs will have lots of useful features that come standard. Maintaining an install of Eclipse is a lot easier than maintaining an install of Vim with plugins X Y and Z in order to simulate the same capabilities. And the most important of all... I love vim and will use it for simple things or when I want to run a macro or am stuck with C code. But for more complicated tasks I'll fire up Eclipse/Visual Studio/Wing. I've written code in lots of different IDEs and occasionally in notepad.  You may totally love notepad but at some point using notepad is industrial sabatoge kind of like hiring a gardener who shows up with a spoon instead of a shovel and a thimble instead of a bucket.  (But who knows maybe the most beautiful garden can be made with a spoon and a thimble but it sure isn't going to be fast) Some IDE's have team and management features.  For example in Visual Studio there is a screen that finds all the TODO: lines in source code. This allows for a different workflow that may or may not exist in other IDEs.  Ditto for source control integration static code analysis etc. Big organizations are slow to change. Not really a programming related problem. Because companies standardize on tools as well as platforms--if your choice of tools is in conflict with their standards then you can either object silently use your tool or use the required tool.   All three are valid; provided your alternative doesn't cause other team-members issues and provided that you have a valid argument to make (not just whining). For example: I develop in Visual Studio 2008 as required by work but use VS2010 whenever possible.  Solutions/Projects saved in 2010 can't be opened in 2008 without some manual finagling--so I can't use the tool of my choice because it would cause friction for other developers.  We also are required to produce code according to documented standards which are enforced by Resharper and StyleCop--if I switched to a different IDE I would have more difficulty in ensuring the code I produced was up to our standards.  Sufficiently bad developers are greatly assisted by the adoption of an appropriately-configured IDE.  It takes a lot of extra time to help each snowflake through his own custom development environment; if somebody doesn't have the chops to maintain their own dev environment independently it gets very expensive to support them. Corporate IT shops are very bad at telling the difference between ""sufficiently bad"" and ""sufficiently good"" developers.  So they just make everybody do the same thing. Disclaimer: I use Eclipse and love it. Theoretically it would decrease the amount of training needed to get an unexperienced developer to deal with the problems of a particular IDE if all the team uses that one tool. Anyway most of the top companies don't force developers to use some specific IDE for now... I agree with this last way of thinking: You don't need your team to master one particular tool having team knowledge in many will improve your likelyhood to know better ways to solve a particular roblems. For me I use Visual Studio with ReSharper.  I cannot be nearly as productive (in .Net) without it.  At least nobody has ever shown me a way to be more productive... Vim that is great.  You can run Vim inside of Visual Studio + R# and get all the niceties that the IDE provides like code navigation code completion and refactoring. Same reason we use a hammer to nail things instead of rocks.  It's a better tool. Now if you are asking why you are forced to use a specific IDE over another well that's a different topic. A place that uses .NET will use Visual Studio 99% of the time at least that's what I've seen.  And I haven't found anything out there that is better than Visual Studio for writing .NET applications. There is much more than code completion into an IDE: etc Nothing to do with incompetence from the programmers. Anybody would be A LOT less productive using vim for developing a big Java EE application. How big were you projects at college? A couple of classes in a couple of files? Or rather a couple of hundreds of classes in a couple of hundreds of files? Today I had the ""honor"" of looking at a file in a rather large project where the programmer opted to use vi (yes vi not vim) and a handcrafted commandline compiler call (no ). The file contained on function spanning about 900 lines with a series of if-else-if-else-constructs (because that way you have all your code in one place!!!!!!). Macho-Programmer at his finest. OK there are very good reasons for enforcing a particular toolset within a production environment: Companies want to standardize everything so that if an employee leaves they can replace that person with minimal effort. Commercial IDEs provide a complex enough environment to support a single interface for a variety of development needs and supporting varying levels of code access. For instance the same file-set could be used by the developer by non-programmers (graphics designers etc.) and document writers.  Combine this with integrated version control and code management without the need of someone learning a particular version control system all of a sudden IDEs start to look nicer and nicer. It also streamlines maintenance of build systems in a multi-homed environment. IDEs are easier to give tutorials to via phone or video and probably come with those. etc. etc. and so forth. The business decision making behind enforcing a standardized environment goes beyond the preference of a single programmer or for that matter perhaps the understanding of the programming team.   Using an IDE helps an employee to work with huge projects with minimal training. Learn a few key combos - and you will comfortably work with multi-thousand-file project in Eclipse IDE handles most of the work for you under the hood. Just imagine how many years of learning it takes to feel comfortable developing such projects in Vim. Besides with an IDE it is easy to support common coding standards across the entire team: just set a couple of options and an IDE will force you to write code in a standardized way. Plus IDE gives a few added bonuses like refactoring tools (especially good in Eclipse) integrated debugging (especially good in Visual Studio) intellisense integrated unit tests integrated version control system etc. The advantages and disadvantages of using an IDE also greatly depends on the development platform. Some platforms are geared towards the use of IDEs others are not. As a rule of thumb you should use IDE for Java and .Net development (unless you're extremely advanced); you should not use IDE for ruby python perl LISP etc development (unless you're extremely new to these languages and associated frameworks). Features like these aren't available in vim: Those are the reasons I choose IntelliJ.  I could go back to sticks and bones but I'd be a lot less productive. As said before the question about using an IDE is basicaly productivity. However there is some questions that should be considered by the company when choosing a specific IDE. that includes: Of course there is a lot more. However I think that this short list help you to see that there is some decisions that are not so easy to take when we are talking about money and some greater companies. And if you start using your own IDE think what mess will be when another developer start doing maintenance into your code. How do you think will the application be signed at the version manager ? Now think about a company with 30+ developers each using its own IDE (each with its own configuration files version and all that stuff)...  Real programmers use the best tools available to get the job done.  Some companies have licenses for tools but there's nothing saying you can't license/use another IDE and then just have the other IDE open to copy/paste what you've done in your local IDE. The question is a bit open-ended perhaps you can make it community wiki... As you point out the IDE can be useful or even a must have for some operations like refactoring or even project exploring: I use Eclipse at my work on Java projects and I find very useful to get a list of all occurrences of the usage of a public method or a class in a project. Likely I appreciate to be able to rename it from where it is defined and having all these occurrences automatically updated.The fact I have the JavaDoc displayed when hovering over a name is very nice too. Like autocompletion jump to a class name etc.And of course debugging facilities... Now usage of Eclipse isn't mandatory in our shop! Some years ago some people used the Delphi IDE (forgot its name) I tried NetBeans etc. But I think we > standardized on Eclipse but it was a natural evolution rather than a company policy. And we often just open files in a text editor when we need a quick update..."
374,Monaca IDE - console.log never appears ,X-Post from here for exposure:   Odd question but only once while using Monaca IDE has anything ever shown up in the console.log portion of the IDE itself. It only occurred when I had a device synced via the debugger. I have since tried syncing it and I never get the device to show in the drop down box it usually says unknown device /www/html/â€¦ Now do know that I have put several console.log(â€˜testâ€™); lines of code to try this out and still no success. I would think that the IDEâ€™s console area would show the log operations from the emulator and not from the device debugger as it has its own log that is view-able on the device but this apparently isnâ€™t the case. Is this correct or am I just really missing something simple here?So this isnâ€™t that big of an issue but I figured out the problem. Basically I keep the Monaca IDE tab open in Chrome all the time (I work via my laptop remotely). When I come back after a long absence (several hours I donâ€™t know what the time out is) the bottom section in the console has the Chrome error showing like that page timed out. The IDE is still there just that section is grayed out. So to fix this I would just refresh the page. The section pops back and all is good EXCEPT I just figured out that it is at that moment when the device connection no longer works. I can still click Run on Device and it works - syncing with the device - but the console.log no longer shows up. In order to get that back and working you have to close the tab and reopen it; then everything works.

401,java - NetBeans IDE under Oracle ,"I'm a bit freaked about what I just read. I did some research as I want to start programming in Java and I came to the conclusion that NetBeans is the best IDE for me because of its capable Swing GUI Designer and powerful reporting with Jasper Reports (iReport).  Yet Oracle (who will soon buy Sun) doesn't seem to care about NetBeans. As I will start building appz in Java no too long from now I would like to know your opinion on the following matter: Shall I continue using NetBeans in spite of the rumours that Oracle will discontinue it or shall I make another the IDE of choice? PS: Basically NetBeans would be the choice but because of the current circumstances I'm doubting this decision. Thank you Oracle have put a lot of time and money into their own product JDeveloper.  It has some pretty neat features.  But it has never got much traction in the industry because many Java developers don't like using proprietary software even though Oracle make quite a big play over their commit to open standards. Anyway at the moment Oracle are still integrating a lot of their freshly acquired BEA WebLogic functionality into the JDeveloper suite.  But I'm sure that once they have sealed the deal to buy Sun they will start to look at what they can take from NetBeans.  Because whatever you may think about Larry Ellison's business methods he knows the value of a dollar.  If there are things worth having in NetBeans they will not be thrown away they will end up in JDeveloper.  So you say it will abandon NetBeans  and salvage some pieces which will go  into JDeveloper? In the long run Oracle will not maintain two Java IDEs.  But look at their strategy for handling previous acquisitions (Seibel JD Edwards BEA etc).  Oracle have kept those products current while they devised a plan for getting the customers onto Oracle's own brand applications.  In some cases this meant dumping Oracle's offering in favour of the acquired product (Seibel Analytics BEA WebLogic Server).  Oracle has made similar sounding pronouncements with regards to MySQL.  People may scoff but I think Oracle will keep MySQL going partly because Larry thinks they can make money from it but also just to spike .  The pertinent bit is NetBeans the Sun-driven open source  Java IDE that has competed with Oracle  JDeveloper and the Eclipse platform  will remain as a ""lightweight  development environment for Java  developers"" Kurian said. But  JDeveloper continues as Oracle's  enterprise development tool. I was a long time eclipse user and although I still like it for some things I believe Netbeans to be a far superior IDE for Java development.  I would say go ahead and use NetBeans.  You will appreciate it more than Eclipse.  In the worst case scenario that Netbeans is no longer supported you will be a much better developer by the time it has reached its end of life (i dont think this will happen though).   Eclipse is better than Netbeans IMHO even though eclipse doesn't allow you to create GUI. If NetBeans seem better for your needs  go with it. I prefer Eclipse but it's just a personal choice. Even if in the future NetBeans will be no longer supported you'll still be able to use it or you'll maybe prefer to start using a another IDE. Java code remain java code no matter of the IDE. I believe that NetBeans will remain supported even under Oracle reign. Since there's a lot of Java developer using it Oracle won't tell all of them to go away. You worry too much. So what if Oracle discontinues NetBeans next month? Your installation still works and will for a long time. Just keep the installer in case you have to set up a new computer. Later you can still make a switch to another IDE. Should Oracle discontinue NetBeans (or threaten to) surely most other IDEs will offer an ""Import NetBeans project"" option."

I did a checkout to my SVN repository with TortoiseSVN and now I want to import the SVN project (a >) into Eclipse and commit files to SVN repository directly from Eclipse IDE.How can i accomplish this? Thanks for help!You need to install an SVN Plugin. I would recommend Subversive you can find it in the Eclipse Marketplace ( and configure your SVN repository. Now you can make all SVN operations directly from Eclipse and there is no need to use TortoiseSVN anymore. The easiest is to use a SVN plugin for eclipse such as Subclipse - . Once installed you would not have any dependency to TortoiseSVN.  Also note that if you wish to use both Subclipse and TortoiseSVN on the same files on your file system your working copy format version supported by the respective clients must be the same. There is a plugin which allows simple usage of Tortoise SVN (and also Beyond Compare) in Eclipse: The 2 Phase Installation instructions are provided in the Eclipse site which I followed to install Tortoise SVN in my Eclipse Luna.I followed the Phase I - Option 1 and Phase 2 which worked well for me. 
418,Lightweight Java IDE that Maintains Indentation? ,"Whenever I am debugging a java program I have to have the code indented! And I hate to manually indent code one by one (using Tab). I would really like a lightweight Java IDE that automatically indents ALL your code at a push of a button. A good example is ""Ready To Program"" Java IDE but the downside to this IDE is that it is not compatible with JDK 1.5+  Are there any suggestions on such a Java IDE? to properly format/indent your Java code.  It's even got a handy shortcut:  Edit: Oh yeah Netbeans is great but not really lightweight... In the good old days I used to use emacs as an ""IDE"" for Java development.  It has excellent support for code indentation and formatting. Coding Java in NPP must be similar experience to shaving yourself with blunt stone and using vodka instead of aftershave. It may look manly but there's no reason. It's XXI century. Intellij will run on any reasonable PC same with NetBeans and Eclipse. Those features are no-brainer for me along with about hundred of others. Build in debugger with ability to execute any piece of code or checking variable state are also necessary. I know that most of debugger may be replaced with good suite of unit tests however sometimes you just need to check something live. And as we are on topic of unit tests even that is possible to simplify with good IDE. Intellij allows you to navigate between class and test class run single test whole class or suite with simple key stroke generate test method from template etc. If you live from writing code then don't do it to yourself and just buy a license or use open version. Life is to short to work on NPP with plugins. Disclaimer: Vim is okay if you have to reconfigure something on live system in order to save a lot of $$$ c's it'll take time to deploy new version. In any other case using advanced notepad is just stupid. Why? For same reason as coding not on decent hardware but on OLPC.  "
419,Delphi IDE begin-end pair indicator ,In Delphi IDE brackets () are easy to match together because the IDE highlights the matching pair when clicked. Is there any way to do this with begin-end pairs?It would definitely improve work efficiency.At least in XE2 I didn't find that option.I use the CnPack (open-source) plug-in; it offers structural highlighting.Delphi 10 Seattle has it natively (per ).
422,iced coffeescript - IDE for IcedCoffeeScript programming? ,What IDE can I use to develop IcedCoffeeScript code with syntax highlight and intellisense?  I tried to use Webstorm but it does not support IcedCoffeeScript.You can't have more than syntax checking/coloring and snippets with (iced)CoffeeScript (on any IDE) because the way the language operate. So intellisense is out of game. Many environments supports autocomplete who can help. note: all editors can have different kinds of autocomplete features with or without packages(extensions).
424,c# - Delegates and VisualStudio IDE ,I have the following code on a control of my own: I thought the IDE would recognize this delegate and allow me to choose a suitable already implemented function or create a new one if I wanted just like it does to events although at least at first glance that does not seem to be the case. Is there a way to set a function to a delegate through the IDE?no there is not use event if you want to use that feature
425,cross compiling - Multiple IDE project files ,We are currently working in a team where we use both Visual Studio and Code::Blocks is there a way to replicate changes between those project files? So if one adds a file to the project file it will also get adjusted in the project file of the other IDE? Please note: We want our project to work on multiple IDE's platforms and compilers. Thus a general solution is welcome too.I assume you're using a VCS? If so my intuition would be to write a script that syncs up your project files (based on modification date?) and run it as a checkin hook if any of the project files are changed in the commit. . CMake uses it's own syntax (which is fairly complex though still easier than autotools in my opinion) which is used with project file generators which supports make visual studio codeblocks eclipse and possibly others.  It also has a installer generator which can make NSIS installers Mac OS X bundles and debian/red hat packages (and again possibly others) which I find quite useful.
427,Selenium IDE HTML Enriquecido ,I am using Selenium IDE but when i tried with command type over a enrich html do not work. Anybody have any idea what I can to do?
432,C++ IDE detecting syntax errors without recompilation? ,I work on Code::Blocks IDE on Windows. Great amount of time is wasted for code recompilation to find errors.Is there a C++ IDE that detects syntax errors without recompilation? I suppose any clang-based IDE would be an option?Microsoft Visual Studio with it's IntelliSense. You'd be surprised at how efficient Qt Creator is at detecting C++ errors before compilation. Give it a try! Eclipse has that awesome feature for Java but IIRC the CDT framework is not as powerful: it detects only vague syntax errors. Microsoft's VisualStudio which is available for free with the Express edition is very good if you are on Windows. Apple's XCode is pretty good but it gives up after only one error it's error messages are very short and cryptic and I believe it is only available on Mac OS X. Unfortunately I do not know of an IDE with this support for Linux. Configure code blocks to work with clang. Working fine for me.
433,PHP IDE Commenting (Netbeans) ,How to make good commenting for PHP IDE (actually i using NetBeans) my target is when i using a class or function there is will be a explanation about it's function like when i typing  there is will be a popup explanation about it function what it parameter and the output.Use PHPDoc style comments 
435,c# - Efficient IDE tools for F#? ,I recently initiated my first F# project using Visual Studio 2012. I was rather surprised (or more precisely disappointed) at the lack of IDE support for F#. For example the classic Ctrl-r Ctrl-r shortcut for refactor rename appears to be completely absent. I installed the F# powertools extension which does provide some support for this - but apparently only supports renaming in the F# part of the solution and not e.g. C# parts of the solution (the solution contains both F# and C# projects). Are there extensions to Visual Studio which provides cross-language refactor rename functionality? In general as a slightly loose question what kind of IDE and/or IDE extensions do people find efficient for F# programming? I'm so used to the efficient VS2012 refactoring support for C# that I can't help to find its absence a considerable blow to efficient use of F#...

439,java - Terminal based IDE ,I'm looking for a IDE that supports java and is based over terminal. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and it doesn't have any gui installed and I'd prefer to keep it that way. However I'd also like to code on it and connect to it from other computers using SSH to code on there to provide a lightweight and fast IDE. It has to be able to edit compile and test Java on the spot and more languages if possible. It would be nice if it had support for multiple projects and had a collapsible project browser like in netbeans and most IDE's. Does anyone know anything that meets the requirements? I'd love something like  however thats only for android. is the only example I can think of. You might be able to get along with vim but there will be a lot of  shell calls.
449,regex - Selenium IDE Square Brackets Regexp ,I'm using the Selenium IDE and I need to select a select (dropdown) element. The target I get in the IDE is as follows: However the 227587 value is dynamic (and is therefore different each time) so I need to use a regexp. Note I also need to match actual square brackets for [0] and [occasion] etc. I tried typing this in the IDE for target: However I keep getting: Any suggestions on how to use regexp for targets in the IDE and also how to account for actual square brackets I need to match?You can use translate for generate id: I have a small example: And the xpath: The result is textData. If there are some data with generated id you can use another filter (or index [])
454,android - Obfuscation option in Eclipse IDE ,I didn't find obfuscation option in Eclipse IDE When i searched in Windows --&gt; Preferences --&gt;Android(In side) --&gt;  I didn't find Obfuscation option in my IDE. How to find? Is there any Plugin requried?? if yes which one??  ThanksFinally i got solution of above question   1- Copy the plugin.jar from DexGuard's eclipse directory to the dropins directory of your Eclipse install 2- Then u go to Windows --&gt; Preferences --&gt;Android(In side) --&gt; obfuscation(DexGuard)--&gt; Enable Obfuscation 3- Typically dexguard does the process automatically but if you need any specific proguarding tasks. Write it into the dexguard-project.txt  file.
456,Is there a reason to have both Eclipse IDE for Java and also Eclipse IDE for Java EE? ,"I've recently downloaded the Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers (for web apps development). Does it make sense to delete my ""regular"" Eclipse IDE for Java developers? I mean is there a feature in the regular IDE which isn't included in the EE IDE?  (I also use eclipse for Python programming with the Pydev plugin). The different ""editions"" of the eclipse IDE are basically just a different set of plugins on top of the basic eclipse platform. So if anything is missing you can alyways install those plugins when you need them. Yes it is a super-set. Also have you tried ? It has better GUI better javadoc support and it is way cooler to use! (and free) Not everyone needs the EE tools (mainly WTP - web tools platform); they may only be doing client apps or writing eclipse plugins."
457,apache flex - Flash Developer IDE ,I was wondering which IDE choice you flash developer use to write the code....I use Flex Builder for my AS3 only project so the code below will display nicely with coloring keywords. I wanted to know if there are better choices there...Also does flash developer do the AS3 programming only? Do they do graphic design at all? Thanks for the reply...I really suggest you to use FlashDevelop as your default IDE. This program is a lot lighter than Flash Builder (which is built on Eclipse).
458,Selenium IDE testing all links ,"I'm trying to use Selenium IDE to test a web app. On one page there are several links which trigger modal windows. I'd like to test ALL the links on the page to ensure that ALL cause modals to pop up. Each link has a class ""modal"" so I thought I could just change the target value in IDE  but that finds only the first link. I've found a few solutions but they use Selenium RC with Java/Python and those can't be directly translated to the IDE. I understand the IDE is not as powerful but I'm setting this up for a non-programmer to use and up till now it's been really simple for them.i had to read up a lot and i want to thank @ohaal and @aleh for their inputs. i used their suggested links as well as some more external reading to reach the solution like so: i'm not selecting any one answer as all of them contributed to the final solution.  Use a while loop and this XPath expression as a locator:  and so on should point to the links you're after. See ): Insert your assertions and probably pop-ups closings before last command (gotoIf)."
464,java - How does IDE show method parameter names? ,I am writing a java program with an open source library using Eclipse and I am observing my IDE suggestions as follows. I added the library to my project by importing jar from IDE.  As you can see in the image it shows me parameter names as srg0 arg1.. However in the source code of the library in github it uses different variable names such as P N r. I have observed in some cases IDE shows the same name that is used in the source. I am curious on how IDE shows parameter name in such cases. How does the IDE pick parameter names to show here?Either the references class would have had to be compiled using the -parameter compiler flag (see )Or you need to attach the source of the library to the library jar
467,scripting - interpreted java IDE environment ,In scripting languages like Ruby/Python/Perl we can start an interactive session and create new variables and essentially execute whatever statements. But in Java I only know of a way to print arbitrary expressions - in Eclipse's debug-expression view. There is no way to create new vars and later utilize that var (though you can assign to pre-existing vars). Is there any way to run Java in a interpreted IDE environment just like scripting languages?Check out  of JShell if you'd like to see it in action.
477,Searching for online Python IDE ,Subj.I seeking IDE with following features:I used to use . Install EclipseInstall PyDev Enjoy! IDLE that ships with Python usually can do it for my use cases. When you first open it you get the repl but File &gt; New Window will give you a file to edit. Save that file as a .py file and f5 to run. I think it addresses your lightweight and fast requirement. JetBrains makes the best IDEs on the market hands down.  Check out .
479,VB6 IDE crashes after application terminates ,"Several developers on my team have this problem. We can run our app in the IDE fine but when we eventually quit the app >. The crash takes the form of  ""Visual Basic has stopped working""  It doesn't matter if we quit our app nicely or force-stop it in the debugger; same result (crashed IDE). The exit sequence for the app is: User selects 'exit' from a menu  Menu event handler calls . We tend to run a group file with a 5-6 projects in it. This error sometimes seems to go away other times it occurs seemingly randomly. I don't know what factor influences this. If we don't actually run the app just the IDE then it works fine and we can quit the IDE itself normally. Anyone seen this before? Any ideas? Thanks!This is most definately caused by leaks of VB6 objects that are involved in subclassing/hooking and not only these. What we did to get rid of these crashes was to instrument all of our classes (including forms user controls designers and anything that can be instantiated) with  debug print statement the call-stack shows you exactly the offenting property of the offending UC. I believe  is correct in its technical assessment of the cause of the problem. But it may also be useful to briefly describe the procedure I used to narrow down the source lines of code. In my case this problem appeared to be TOTALLY random so it was hard to know where to start. My approach was not rocket science - more brute force. Essentially I used a binary search to rule in/out sections of code. First step was to comment out the entire startup procedure so that the app would start as an empty shell; this demonstrated that the problem went away (null result). Following that I recursively commented in roughly half the code testing for the problem each time. Each block was evaluated as a boolean - it either did or did not cause the problem. Then proceed again in the block not ruled out. Eventually (and more quickly than I anticipated) this led to a single line of code which accessed a property of a third-party control."
482,node.js - Javascript IDE errors ,I'm not sure how to to explain this problem so I can't really find any solutions on Google. I am new to the whole Javascript world and its technologies. I am using NodeJS + Express + Jade to make a web application I got this project from my colleague. But somehow my IDE keeps saying statement or expression expected everywhere. Your IDE linter for javascript doesn't understand recent javascript features like arrow functions. Make sure your IDE supports Ecmascript 6.
487,javascript - IDE for Jquery development ,What do you suggest for JQuery development IDE. Is there something similar to Eclipse for java so I can run/debug my application in it? Im getting a lot of work based on JQuery Widget and JQuery UI. I'm working on Fedora.I'm using netbeans. It has quite a good JS Editor and works sometimes well with jQuery but has not all functions integrated and can't suggest the params right - but i don't know any IDE who can do this For editing use debugger tools in modern browsers like chrome ;)
491,Autoformat Javascript in Netbeans IDE ,Are there any known Plugins or ways to properly autoformat Javascript in Netbeans IDE? After looking into this further I have found that the javascript module is being rewritten already(much needed).  You can finally find formatting options for javascript.  It's available in the netbeans nightly builds.  Good luck all.    You have to use an alternate key for now.  I'm working on modifying the Javascript language in Netbeans to possibly release something better later on(either as a plugin or patch).  I'm still familiarizing myself with the way things are happening in Netbeans.   There have been talks for years to add more formatting options for Javascript in Netbeans.  Nothing has surfaced.  I'm going to propose that the Javascript language leverage JSBeautify(running in Rhino) to provide formatting rather then implementing new features in Java.  This simplifies the formatting process plus the JSBeautify community is very large and it's actively developed.
