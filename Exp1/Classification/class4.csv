38,What is the best IDE for C Development / Why use Emacs over an IDE? ,"so as per one of my previous questions I'm brushing up on my C skills.  Thanks for posting links which answer some of my questions but I guess what I'm really wondering about is: Whether learning to edit using emacs / vim and compiling / debugging using the gcc-toolchain is worth it instead of just using an IDE and why? What are peoples reasons for not migrating to an IDE? Has anyone moved from terminal-centric development to IDE development and why did they move?I started off by using IDEs Microsoft or not. Then while working on QNX some long time ago I was forced to do with a text editor + compiler/linker. Now I prefer this simple combination––a syntax highlighting editor + C compiler and linker cli + make––to any IDEs even if environment allows for them. The reasons are for me: it's everywhere. If you program in C you do have the compiler and usually you can get yourself an editor. The first thing I do––I get myself nedit on Linux or Notepad++ on Windows. I would go with vi but GUI editors provide for a better fonts and that is important when you look at code all day you can program remotely via ssh when you need to. And it does help a lot sometimes to be able to ssh into the target and do some quick things there it keeps me close to CLI preferably UNIX/Linux CLI. So all the commands are on my fingertips and when I need them I don't have to go read a reference book. And UNIX CLI can do things IDEs often can't––because their developers didn't think you'd need them most importantly it is very much like seeing the Matrix in raw code. I operate files so I'm forced to keep them manageable. I'm finding things in my code manually which makes me keep it simple and organized. I do Config Management explicitly so I know when I'm synced and how. I know my Makefiles because I write them and they only do what I tell them to (if you wonder if that works in ""really big projects""––it does work and the bigger the project the more performance it gains me) when people ask me to look at their code I don't have to learn the IDE they use I've moved from a terminal text-editor+make environment to Eclipse for most of my projects. Spanning from C and C++ to Java and Python to name few languages I am currently working with. The reason was simply productivity. I could not afford spending time and effort on keeping all projects ""in my head"" as other things got more important.  There are benefits of using the ""hardcore"" approach (terminal) - such as that you have a much thinner layer between yourself and the code which allows you to be a bit more productive when you're all ""inside"" the project and everything is on the top of your head. But I don't think it is possible to defend that way of working just for it's own sake when your mind is needed elsewhere. Usually when you work with command line tools you will frequently have to solve a lot of boilerplate problems that will keep you from being productive. You will need to know the tools in detail to fully leverage their potentials. Also maintaining a project will take a lot more effort. Refactoring will lead to updates in make-files etc. To summarize: If you only work on one or two projects preferably full-time without too much distractions ""terminal based coding"" can be more productive than a full blown IDE. However if you need to spend your thinking energy on something more important an IDE is definitely the way to go in order to keep productivity. Make your choice accordingly. Emacs >. I have used Eclipse with the CDT plug in quite successfully. Emacs would be better if it had a text editor in it... :-) Use . Crossplatform as it is 100% pure Java. Not the fastest IDE on earth but for Java actually very fast very flexible not that nice looking though. Both have very sophisticated code folding syntax highlighting (for all languages you can think of!) and are very flexible regarding configuring it for you personal needs. jEdit is BTW very easy to extend to add whatever feature you may need there (it has an ultra simple scripting language that looks like Java but is actually ""scripted""). If you're on Windows then it's a total no-brainer: Get Visual C++ Express."
39,java - IDE for Swing ,Is there any IDE that simplifies creating Swing applications (ideally something along the lines of Visual Studio)Like others have mentioned NetBeans' visual editor is pretty good but it's based pretty heavily on the  plugin: which is also based on Eclipse simply adding a few plugins to it as many other commercial products do. It is still not able to parse any Swing code (I doubt any Swing WISIWYG editor does) but if you start with it it gives you relatively seamless experience.You need to pay for it though. At the end of the day I have worked with different similar UI tools Flash Builder Delphi etc. but unless you do some relatively trivial UI design not including much business logic and communication with other layers you'll have to accept that what you are capable of creating in code once you learn to do it properly is much more powerful than what any editor is capable of providing you with. I have switched between several IDEs and the one that I believe has the best GUI builder in terms of use and performance would have to be NetBeans. I have tried a few and the closest I have found that comes close to Visual Studio is NetBeans. Version 6.5 is excellent and really improved over version 5. I'm a big fan of JetBrains and when it comes to Java  Use NetBeans I have also successfully developed one application using NetBeans. It is realy awesome it helps you while writing the code.Since Swing generates some code on its own so it is really helpful to use Netbeans.Go through it and you can always ask question and problems.It will be good if you go for latest version release. I have always coded my UIs by hand. The frustration of dealing with screen builders and filling out all those property sheets is too much for me. After a couple of screens and a little research I am just as productive. As I'm using Eclipse I use the Visual Editor plugin. It generates clean source code with good patterns and easy to patch/modify/extend.Unfortunately it is not very stable. But it's worth trying. I like Eclipse's VisualEditor (VE) and sometime ago I've tried to switch toanother editor but I found it impossible. Visual editor has thisfeature that it generates manageable readable editable and easy-to-understand code. Unlike both mentioned earlier NetBeans editor and WindowBuilder it uses the lazy initialization pattern to separate initialization of components. Also it does not need to lock down parts of code that you can't edit; you may edit code by hand and VE is still able to work with your changes. The only disadvantage of VE is that it uses  is good option and it is free also. As others have mentioned my best experience with Java SWING applications is with NetBeans. NetBeans has a WYSIWYG editor and the code is automatically generated for you which is then protected however you can add custom code to add listeners and other events that the end user may be interested in using such as buttons text forms and areas and other nice GUI tools.
53,Scheme IDE for Windows ,What is a good Scheme IDE for Windows? OK I'll admit it; I'm not at RMS's level and don't want to use Emacs or any character-based interface -- I want a graphic IDE with colorization a REPL and usable in-line help for a specific well-documented dialect of Scheme. I have searched around and PLT Scheme/DrScheme seems the best but even that does not look too sophisticated. is an excellenet product well worth taking a look at. It's got all the features you're asking for I think what you want actually is Emacs. Let's see: I've been playing with Xacc.Ide and Iron Scheme and found they were pretty good although they felt not finished in some places. They're good enough for trying out scheme I'm not sure if I'd use them for writing commercial software though. I've seen the author of both of them hang around here so maybe he can tell more.. As far as I know (I used DrScheme for a few months before switching to Emacs) DrScheme has many IDE-like features but they are presented in a simplified interface because of its educational focus. Do some digging and I think you'll be happy what you find. Also I can't resist since I > use Emacs---an OS specific install of emacs is hardly ever character based. I just found out the scheme plugin for eclipse I haven't try it yet.It looks pretty nice.and its git repository I personally use ChezScheme. I run scheme scripts from the console and edit them in eclipse using the SchemeWay plugin. Eclipse is superior to Emacs in my opinion and it has some nice features like automatic indentation and autocomplete for defined names.
59,java - MATLAB IDE setup : Eclipse IDE error : JVM ,I have installed eclipse 3.4 and it's working. I tried to setup IDE with 'eclipseidesetup'. when I give the eclipse path and press OK it says:  which is absolutely wrong because my eclipse is working and my JVM is 64-bit because of my system. what's making this happen? I've read this matlab help articles and none helped: OS: Linux mint - kernel 3.14.17 - 64bitMATLAB R2014aFirst of all you should  to make it run properly.
61,Python documentator IDE guiding ,Suppose I have such function: In my case the IDE has no way to know what goes in there.How I tell it by using comments? In case of PHP i've used something like this Another use case is when I know that in some case some proxy will return some objectIDE has no chance to know but I know for sure and want to specify this by comment to help myself in future and to help IDE. In PHP while using PhpStorm I would do following: How can I achieve same behavior with PyCharm specificaly and python documentators in common?Use a  see the following pseudo code: I am not sure if it will work in PyCharm (I don't use it) - but for Python 3  were added. You can put those into the definition of a function: Maybe PyCharm will use this to define which methods are available on someobject.  After a small test I guess this should work (which is pretty awesome).
62,Disconnect other IDE instances in Cloud9 IDE ,I was wondering if there's a way to disconnect other IDE instances in Cloud9 IDE because I left C9 IDE on at work and I have the code highlighted which makes it hard to work with when I get home.There's currently no way to remotely disconnect other collaborators (which you became once you opened your workspace on multiple tabs) but you could disable collaboration altogether by adding  to the IDE URL which should remove the code highlighting.
68,excel - Recommended IDE for VBA ,"Is there a recommended IDE for developing Excel VBA macros that provides reasonable error reporting and code completion? Currently I'm using ""Microsoft Visual Basic For Application"" IDE which comes with Excel 2007 but so far it is less than ideal. Even a plug-in to Vim or Emacs will be great.I use and recommend !  You can download it right in :  And you're all set to open edit and save  files."
79,Using Vi Vim or GVim as an IDE ,I am forced to use VS2008 for the bulk of my projects at work but whenever the odd text file needs editing I use Vim. Now I know that there are plugins and whatnot that can make VIM work like an IDE so I am wondering if anyone actually uses it as an IDE? EDIT: For those of you who think you speak for the masses in saying that Vim should not be used as an IDE please consider that IDE features are the number one feature request on the .Vim is an amazing piece of software but pretty messy too due to it's age. . Omni-completion requires file-type specific plugins the This project make vim as a IDE for multi-language developing. I sometimes use Vim as an IDE within  plugin that gives you similar powers that you have in Microsoft's Database Management Studio.
86,scala - Any IDE supporting SBT? ,is any IDE supporting SBT in a proper way (like Maven for example)? Because I've found a lot of tools that > but I haven't found any plugins that give any support of SBT interaction form within IDE. I want to make an IDE-agnostic project based on SBT but also I want to be able to use full spectrum of features that IDE provide and not just use it as an editor and do all the other stuff from console.Does  (and a Scala plugin obviously!) I know this isn't exactly what you're looking for but putting it here as a work-around for working with SBT in eclipse for whoever is interested. SBT generates eclipse config files but after you import it it works fine from within eclipse. You just need to set up the project for the first time outside of Eclipse run SBT to resolve dependencies generate eclipse structure using the eclipse sbt plugin and import into Eclipse. After that you can run the code directly from Eclipse and it works fine. Here're the steps in detail: Create the folder structure as follows:
97,How to Turn Off Showing Whitespace Characters in Visual Studio IDE ,I don't know what I did but I don't know how to get rid of those arrows on the left. 
100,vim - Modal fully fledged IDE ,I am trying to find a good IDE. I always found Vim's modal behaviour interesting but Vim is more of a text editor than an IDE. Even though I have made a few changes to my .vimrc file Vim isn't IDE enough. Any suggestions? FYI: By IDE I mean it's got to have a debugger autocomplete and easy compilation  Edit: I do web development backend node.js python and Ruby on RailsI'd start by listing features you need from your IDE in order of importance.  Think about (random order): Of course you can consider many more features and find them much more important than the ones I listed here. It's totally individual preference since that's you who has to be comfortable.  If you want to use the power of VIM you have basically three options:  Start with vanilla VIM and incrementally add settings and plugins you need. Check out existing configs and adapt them. To make it fully fledged IDE I'd recommend some plugins:  I recommend one of these: or this:  It also depends what your programming environment is. Having autocomplete and compiling from in the vim editor is no problem. Debugging depends but you can also do debugging with other tools and be perfectly fine. Just because other IDEs do it doesn't mean it's the best way. Don't try to get it perfect just from the beginning and don't try to copy every feature your known IDE has. Accept the initial pain and enjoy all those little improvements that you can make every single day. All those improvements will sum up and after a while you will be very proficient. Even years after you still will find ways to improve your workflow. There has been recent development in (at least) those three projects based on nvim extensibility and addressing your very concern: I seems that they are all in early alpha though let's hope the best for them :)
101,Is there any online IDE for Java? ,It doesn't have to be full blown of course and console output only would be enough.  I'd like it to be able to work on some program parts on any PC which has internet connection.   I'm really looking for a lightweight IDE I can also use for quick testsYou can use  There is an online editor for any FTP server. It's tageted to PHP (bacause it's the common way to work with PHP) but you can use it for java too.
102,java - JRE JDK and IDE revisited ,I know this question must've been asked alot of times already but I've got some specific questions that need answering to. The underlying question I am trying to ask here is . I understand that JRE has the run time libraries JDK contains the compiler/debugger and everything else that JRE has. IDE is my Eclipse.  : When exactly will I need just the JRE and nothing else? i.e. under what circumstances will only having JRE suffice. If I were to emulate such behaviour what are the necessary steps required. (> ) Thanks If all you want to do is run an already compiled Java program then a JRE is all you need. So if you were developing software for someone else you'd have JDK and IDE installed on your machine for development purposes but you'd only need to install the JRE on the client machine for them to be able to run it. Question 1 : If I am trying to develop something in Java is it  necessary that I need JDK for it? Because as I understand I can make  do with IDE + JRE. My IDE provides me with compiler/debugger and I  will refer the JRE from my IDE. So it should be alright right? As you said JDK is required for compilation and JRE is required for running the program. No matter who provides(IDE or system path) if you have those you should be able to compile and run your programs. Question 2 : From the above question is it safe to say that IDE  contains JDK in it already? You can't generalise the statement tha IDE contains JDK. Few does few may not. Question 3 : When exactly will I need just the JRE and nothing else?  i.e. under what circumstances will only having JRE suffice. If I were  to emulate such behaviour what are the necessary steps required. (I  can make it more clear if you have not understood it. ) If you have classes/jar with you. You can run them without needing JDK. Answering > java code.   Yes some IDEs like Eclpse ship jdk with the ide. The downside you can't use cmd prompt to execute java code.  You'll need JRE to run every applications thats been written in Java. When you will implement your project you'll have to setup JRE to your client in order for them to run it.
109,Is Eclipse the best IDE for Java? ,"Is Eclipse the best  for Java?  If not is there something better?  I want to know and possibly try it out.  Thanks.Let me just start out by saying that Eclipse is a > affordable (last I heard $50 for the distro plus a year of free upgrades). If you have the budget and need the added functionality I'd go with something like that. Anyway I've tried to be as detailed as I can. I hope this helps and good luck on your search! :) IntelliJ IDEA was awsome. Now it is just ""better than Eclipse"". You can code in IDEA several times faster than in Eclipse in my experience (I moved from being an Eclipse early-adopter to IDEA and haven't looked back) but IDEA has a number of flaws: I still wouldn't go back though; the code refactorings and intentions in IDEA are just too good. A major version of Eclipse came out a while back and it took me about an hour of searching on the website to figure out what was actually contained in the release which might persuade me back into the fold. Visit  to see how to sell an IDE! There is no best IDE. You make it as good as you get used using it. Eclipse can't remotely be called an IDE to my opinion. Okay that's exaggerated I know. It merely reflects my intense agony thanks to eclipse! Whatever you do it just doesn't work! You always need to fight with it to make it do things the right way. During that time you're not developing code which is what you're supposed to do right? eclipse and maven integration: unreliable! Eclipse and ivy integration: unreliable. WTP: buggy buggy buggy! Eclipse and wstl validation: buggy! It complains about not finding URL's out of the blue even though they do exist and a few days later without having changed them it suddenly does find them etc etc. I Could write a frakking book about it. To answer your question: NO ECLIPSE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE THE BEST IDE!!! IntelliJ is supposed to be MUCH better! Eclipse was the first IDE to move me off of XEmacs.  However when my employer offered to buy me a Intellij IDEA license if I wanted one it only took 3 days with an evaluation copy to convince me to go for it. It seems like so many small things are just nicer. IntelliJ is good one but its not free!!Then NetBeans is also a good option.Also if you are IBM suite WSAD is good I'd have to vote for Netbeans as the best one currently.  Eclipse is decent but right now Netbeans is better. I used IntelliJ for almost 5+ years (from v1.5 to v7) and around 8 months ago I migrated to IBM RAD (which is built on top of old eclipse platform) and around 3 months ago I settled down with Eclipse (Ganymede). I used IntelliJ on a mid size projects (with 10k classes) and I'm using Eclipse on one with just few hundreds of classes. I found both of these IDEs (IntelliJ and Eclipse) to be good. IBM RAD is just a waste of money (ofcourse one could be stuck in an IBM shop without choice). IntelliJ has far superior refactoring capabilities and keyboard shortcuts for most of the features compared to Eclipse. It supports importing projects from Eclipse. It has better built in xml handling capabilities (with refactorings applicable almost like for the java code). Built in Intelli Sense is also very good. Eclipse is a great tool and its free. It took me around 1-2 months to get used to Eclipse from IntelliJ (lot of unlearning of shortcuts) but I got hang of Eclipse it has been pretty smooth. I havent used Eclipse on mid size project. Both IntelliJ and Eclipse have active plugin communities and both integrate well with version control systems unit test frameworks application servers and profilers. IntelliJ started becoming slow and bloated starting from v4.0. It was slow with mid size projects. I would not use IntelliJ unless its performance can be improved. I havent used these two IDEs for anything other than java development. If you are a java developer and your company pays for IntelliJ and if your project is not too big go for it. Otherwise dont despair: Eclipse is always there. I gave Eclipse a 3 months ride at my new work but after that I found out that normal Maven project can be run in IntelliJ IDEA too (unless it's Eclipse plugin/EMF/something of course ;-)). 3 months are not enough to compare it with 8+ years with IDEA but it's enough to claim I gave it a fair try. I decided to live with its perspectives (other IDEs don't need them) with its poor debugger (doesn't show date values unless you click on them! etc.) with its comparatively worse completion than IDEA has. Now after all those years IDEA is also free (community edition) and I use it without much trouble. Of course I miss some of those ""Ultimate"" features of paid version but it's far better than Eclipse. Biggest difference is the whole mindset needed for both of these IDEs. But after you master the mindset of either I can't understand what can anyone hold to Eclipse - unless you need its plugin ecosystem or you have some serious investments there. Example of ""mindset"" differences: You have to save in Eclipse not in IDEA and I don't care what is better or worse - but you have to save in Eclipse to let him clean up underlined errors that are not errors anymore etc. ;-) You have to save there in order to get rid of errors in other files too because other file doesn't see the changes otherwise. I blogged much more about this topic - and yes I'm biased though I tried to be as little as possible. But after some time it wasn't simply possible: :-) And no not even IDEA is perfect I know it. Because I use it a lot. But it is the best Java IDE if you ask me. Even the Community edition. [This is not really an answer just an anecdote. I worked with guys who used emacs heavily loaded with macros and color coded. Crazy! Why do that when there are so many good IDEs out there?] if you know you way around emacs you can code 100x faster then an IDE. And it can handle bunch of diffrent languages so you do not need to change your coding enviroment if you need to code in another language. Works on all operating systems you can custimize/add anything you want. Even edit files half way across the world over ssh.(no downloading or uploading).Before calling them crazy you gotto use it first. i am sure they are calling you crazy for using an IDE :). It is often said that there are better IDE's for various languages (eg Java) than Eclipse. The power of Eclipse is that it's basically the same IDE for > languages meaning that if you know you'll have to code in several programming languages (Java C++ Python) it's a huge advantage that you only have to learn one IDE: Eclipse. I don't know if Eclipse is THE BEST Java IDE but it is definitely very decent and my favorite IDE. I tried IntelliJ briefly before and found that it's pretty similar to Eclipse (IntelliJ might offer some nicer features but Eclipse is free and open source).I never really tried NetBean because I know Eclipse before I know NetBean. Eclipse is my favorite because: If you are used to using conventional Java IDE like JCreator you might need some time to get used to Eclipse. I remember when I first learned Eclipse I didn't know how to compile Java source...   I would suggest that in order to find the best IDE FOR YOU try what people recommended (NetBean Eclipse and IntelliJ) and see which one you like the most then stick with it and become an expert of it. Having the right IDE will boost up your productivity a lot in my opinion.  Eclipse!  It can be slow at times and uses a lot of memory but it works well. I am going to have to recommend  by my job. I find the UI design much better than Eclipse. Also it comes with an incredible amount of features built in including great support for EJB3 JSF WebServices etc. It is essentially an IDE for the entire JavaEE stack (and the Oracle ADF framework as well). - All of the tools you will (probably) need for JavaEE development come with this IDE right out of the box no plugins required (unless you download the minimalist version). Talking about java Ide it is better to go for NetBeans.In My opinion it is better and provide great advantage over other ide but it has disadvantage over Eclipse that it grabs more more while working but do to its features and support i suggest Netbeans than any ide This is subjective... I find it to be a good tool. It depends what kind of development you're doing - for EJB stuff many folk would favour Netbeans. It also depends how much you want to spend - I assume you're talking about free IDEs? In my opinion if you got the resources to use then go with eclipse. NetBeans which is awesome like eclipse is another best option these are the only 2 I've ever used (loved needed wanted) Eclipse is hands down the most popular and for good reason! Hope this helps. Agreeing with the others. Netbeans is a pretty good IDE which also caters for other languages (PHP Ruby C/C++) if you're prone to using any of those. Then you get the added benefit of knowing your way around the IDE when deciding to pick up a new language. To be fair however I haven't had much time with the eclipse IDE. I'd agree with some of the others out there saying that NetBeans and IntelliJ are both good IDEs.  And I'd say that in using all three (Eclipse + other two) that Eclipse is by far my favorite.  I found some of the documentation out-dated but also found the support community very helpful.  I started using Eclipse by jumping into the deep end of the pool:  writing an RCP before ever learning the IDE.  The IDE was intuitive to use and when I found the right news groups to post to - most of my questions were already answered.  The hardest thing for me (and frustrating admittedly) was knowing how to phrase my search terms in order to get to the answer that was already posted. Remember that Eclipse is still ""relatively new"" as an IDE player though given that - it's pretty darn robust. My only complaint about Eclipse is that with each new release it seems to hog up more resources.  With a mid-sized project/workspace it takes seemingly forever to build (or rebuild) the project.  Compared to IntelliJ it's faster and more intuitive to use. Don't forget that Eclipse Platform was started by IBM. There are few platforms out there. The advantage with Eclipse is that it can be customized to your development pleasure plugins can be written for Eclipse to conform to your needs (e.g. The Eclipse ""Easy Explorer"" plugin for browsing the directory of your source in Windows Explorer).Eclipse allows you to also incorporate other languages/SDK's such as C++ Silverlight projects Android Projects for development. You can also easily manage resources in Eclipse. In my experience NetBeans are resource intensive. Oracle JDeveloper and IntelliJ aren't free though.Oh yes If you have issues or bugs with Eclipse Eclipse has the ability to restart and submit the crash to Eclipse servers. This is not really an answer just an anecdote.  I worked with guys who used emacs heavily loaded with macros and color coded.  Crazy!  Why do that when there are so many good IDEs out there? I have experience with using . I like it because it is easy to use and it is free. Give it a try if it interests you."
110,javascript - Efficient usage of WebStorm IDE ,I've recently fallen in love in WebStorm as an IDE for JavaScript development. The problem is I come from a world of vim and lightweight editors so I probably can't fully appreciate all the power that comes with IDE. Yes I've seen the presentations and read the docs but there's a lot of features and I'm not sure which of them are truly useful. So here goes my question: how do you use WebStorm and what do you find most useful? Any power-usage tips? Configuration hacks? Plugins worth mentioning? I'm not looking for a list of features I'm looking for a real-world usage examples and impressions. PS. I work mostly with pure JS + Canvas element and some NodeJS.Some random thoughts maybe more later.... In the help definitely read the Basic Concepts and skim the WebStorm Usage Guidelines for actions that you care about. Learn to use  Ctrl-Shift-A. It allows you to 1uickly find actions you can do by typing part of them. With that you can find anything once you know it exists. WebStorm's (like IntelliJ) best magic is its code completion and refactoring features which come from its code parsing and awareness. It figures a lot of stuff out but you can help it out by making you have good source files. Put the commented versions of the libraries you use in your project so it can use those comments to display in the doc popups (just having them in the directory is all you need). Be sure to leave the tips on. Their forums are useful but if you have a problem or feature request put it right into youtrack.com. They are much more responsive there. You can also vote for the stuff you want added. And if you haven't seen it yet there is a VIM plugin which will give you VIM editor keys called  JsTestDriver integration. Plugins. You can always find something useful.
117,jquery - Good Free Javascript IDE? ,I recently started learning jQuery so I'm looking for a good free Javascript IDE with jQuery support. If anyone know a good IDE please let me know. Thanks :)There are no JavaScript IDEs that I know of. There > IDEs that support JavaScript though. Try . But I personally just use a text editor with good syntax highlighting. When I am on Windows I use Notepad++.
133,Jump into interface implementation in Eclipse IDE ,You know how in Eclipse pressing Here's what I do: The procedure isn't very quick but it gives you a good overview. Well... well... I hope you use Eclipse Helios because what you asked is available on Helios. Put your text cursor again on the method and click menu Navigate → Open Implementation. Now if you have more than one implementation of the method you will get choice to pick which implementation to open. 
135,xml - IDE for XSLT stylesheets ,What is the best IDE for creating and debugging complex XSLT stylesheets?  For debugging the ability to set breakpoints and step through the source would be great. I am interested in all options both commercial and free.Editors worth checking out: All have their specific advantages so just check them out. If you already have Visual Studio I'd suggest you just getting started with this one. I use Visual Studio. It lets you set breakpoints (conditional or otherwise) and establish watches on whatever XPath expression you can come up with. It also supports XSLT right out the box and colours it differently than regular XML so developing in it is very easy. My recommendation is XMLSpy but isn't free - . Hope this helps.

143,Good IDE for HTML ,"I recently started to learn HTML from Code Academy. I have searched around a bit but I have not been able to find a good IDE that closely resembles the one used in the Code Academy course. If anyone has any suggestions please tell me. I'm just looking for an IDE that resembles the one used in the Code Academy course.Most devs I know use Sublime Text me personally I use a variety of tools depending on what I'm working on. Which are good however are as always with this type of question subject to opinion. What's good for me may not suit you where as something I hate may be the perfect tool for you. One bit of advice I will give you though learn to code raw before you go looking for an editor that has all the bells and whistles and does stuff for you. If your just starting out and your learning HTML one of the worst things IMHO that you can do is to use an editor that writes the code for you. I've trained a LOT of developers over the years and by far the ones that always performed the worst where the ones that used automated tools early in their training. If you learn to write code using a very minimalist editor then you'll quickly grow to understand what your writing better rather than thinking ""oh my editor will do this for me and I can look it up later"" For me personally I have no problems logging into a Linux server at the command line and using something like midnight commander to live edit web pages in real time on a live web site :-) If I want the bells and whistles and I'm on windows then Visual Studio is often my tool of choice if I'm on Linux at a desktop then often Net beans. Every application has it's pros and cons the best way to find your perfect tool is to just try a few and see how you feel it's like buying a new pair of shoes unless you try them you'll never know if their going to fit or not. For HTML and such I really like Sublime Text ("

149,What is the best IDE for PHP? ,I'm a PHP developer and now I use  and several others but I'm not really decided they all look nice enough but a bit complicated. I'm sure it'll all get easy once I get used to it but I don't want to waste my time. This is what I'm looking for:Are you sure you're looking for an IDE?  The features you're describing along with the impression of being too complicated that you got from e.g. Aptana suggest that perhaps all you really want is a good editor with syntax highlighting and integration with some common workflow tools.  For this there are tons of options. I've used .He says it here:  would be my second choice. My only problem with Komodo is that the autocomplete is not as good. With properly structured apps where you use phpDoc to document return types etc. it should be alright. But I work on a project that doesn't really do that and Komodo can't read across files to know that $user is a User object for example. Personally everything that is based uppon Eclipse or NetBeans is an overkill the GUI is crap and the performance is soooo slow compared to other alternatives. If you're willing to pay I would suggest Zend IDE (version 5.5 not 6 because it's based on Eclipse) and EditPlus for a more lightweight yet powerfull code editor. If you're looking for free alternatives or if you code in other languages other than PHP OpenKomodo is a really nice IDE with almost all the features (no SVN neither CVS) that you require the only con I see about OpenKomodo is that sometimes it messes my code indentation but then again I don't use it on a very regular basis. As for a free lightweight alternative: Notepad++. =) My personal preference is Eclipse (with various plug-ins) as I am developing in several languages (PHP Java and Ruby) and this way I am always used to interface and keyboard shortcuts. This is not a minor thing as you become very productive this way. I haven't used Aptana but will (hopefully) soon - it does look interesting though.For others IDEs I have used: jEdit (for little Java) Notepad++ (still for some scripting and short test code runs).And for the features You asked: Eclipse support many source code version servers ( is as close to Eclipse java power as it could get. Eclipse PDT is much weaker (last time I checked). I'm using PHPDesigner but I will go for Eclipse PDT. I was always against Eclipse until few months ago when I have one Java project to finish... Great IDE Now I can't imagine one day without Eclipse. :) Have you tried NetBeans 6? Zend Studio and NetBeans 6 are the best IDEs with PHP support you'll come across and NetBeans is free.
158,git coding with IDE ,I'm new to Git. Before using Git I used Subversion for my web project. One thing I'm wondering is how to code on an IDE when working with GIT. As for SVN only one version of code is locally stored on your computer so we just have to open and edit that version directly before committing it to the remote repo. However for Git we have multiples revisions stored locally so I don't know how to work using an IDE. Must the IDE support Git? Currently I'm only managing to code using an integrated editor in Terminal which is not very convenient.I don't understand how the IDE is relevant. You just commit whenever you want as normal and then when you want to push to a remote repository you do so. It's a bonus if the IDE supports Git of course as then you don't need to switch between a console and the IDE but it certainly doesn't > to. The IDE should ignore Git's repository just as it would have to ignore the .svn directories for Subversion. Certainly working with Visual Studio - even without any plugins - has given me no Git-related problems. A lot of major IDEs have some support for Git. It usually comes from a plugin not from the core functionality of the IDE. At the very least the git integration of your IDE should allow you to commit and push to the remote repo. It may also work on earlier commits etc. Your mileage may vary depending on your language of choice what IDE you're using and your platform. All of this is just a wrapper for system commands so there's nothing that you won't be able to do it might just not be convenient. I agree with Jon -- the IDE is irrelevant. You'd just work normally. If you point the IDE to the right directory it'll show the code and let you work on it. With git you have the master branch to which you usually commit your changes. There is no difference to SVN cause in SVN you usually commit to the trunk. If you are working with branches you will change to the branch either with SVN or with Git and do your commits there. That's it. One of the differences between Git and SVN in this use case is you have the whole history availabe while working with Git. As Jon has already mentioned the .git folder that contains all versions is hidden from the IDE. You always have one version checked out in your work directory which just contains ordinary source code. I work with Netbeans for which an plugin exists that supports some very basic features of GIT. It highlights lines that have been changed added or deleted compared to the previous version which is quite useful. For branching commiting and so on I use a terminal.
162,php - Popping the IDE cherry ,Although I've been a developer for years I've never used a PHP IDE - I've always just used a decent editor. What am I missing? I generally code on local servers so I can debug as if my code were running on my own machine I have code highlighting I have shortcuts set up to look up function names and so on. Is it worth investing the time in learning to use a full IDE? Is it worth investing the money in purchasing one? Looking at (the slightly aging)  I would probably go for PhpDesigner or possibly Eclipse.Consider  is a veteran in the IDE field. It's not free but it's not expensive either - yet. Has a long trial period and you can use it afterwards - it just closes every half an hour but that's it. phped from nusphere. We prefer it over zend). Regards rbo i've been using nuSphere netbeans and eclipse for a while and of these three i find netbeans the most usefull. it doesn't hang as often as eclipse does and it has a lot of shortcuts for project browsing. i find myself browsing the projects a lot faster using netbeans than the other 2 and it has a lot of features you most likely won't use but you can disable them so they won't eat up resources. I tried PHPed and nusphere debugger and it works really good too. I prefer PHPed instead NetBeans is lightweight you can encode your php scripts for distribution nusphere has php express too an extension to execute php scripts encoded with nucoder inside PHPEd.
175,python - Actually opening spyder IDE ,I've been trying to follow instructions on  I'm just trying to get the IDE running so that I can write my program within it to help me program easier. The only IDE i've used before is eclipse so maybe I'm not thinking of an IDE the right way but I'm expecting something kind of like eclipse.(>) I think our installation instructions are quite clear but I repeat them here for you again: If you are new to Python or the Scientific Python ecosystem we  recommend you to install and use . It comes with Spyder and all its dependencies along with the most important Python scientific libraries (i.e. Numpy Pandas Matplotlib IPython etc) in a single easy to use environment. After installing Anaconda you need to open the Anaconda Navigator (using Spotlight) and run Spyder from there. Another option is to open  but you should really remove what you installed with it and use Anaconda instead. As we said in our installation instructions too: We also support pip but please be aware that pip installations are for advanced users with good knowledge of all Spyder dependencies. This clearly seems to be not your case.
178,java - Files edited outside the ide ,"If I run a script to edit files outside of the ide I am using will the ide recognize the changes made to the files? More specifically:-IDE: Netbeans 6.8-Version Control: CVS-OS: Windows XPIn general yes. But the form designer of NetBeans considers some parts of the code ""private"" and you shouldn't modify these parts externally. They are identified by comments in the generated code: These parts are in fact generated from an external proprietary .form file and having the source code not aligned with the .form code will mess everything up. Yes it should. Give it a whirl and check it out. Yes with some caveats: If you have those files open edited and unsaved in the IDE at the time then you will need to tell the IDE whether to discard or keep your in-IDE changes. If you have them open and unedited then depending on the IDE you may have to tell it to reload those files (the IDE should warn you that the file has changed since you last opened it). If you move files around and your IDE has some kind of project file (that tells it among other things where all the files are) and you don't update it accordingly you may have problems. Any files that you don't already have open in your IDE should behave as expected and I would consider it a bug if it didn't pick up the changes."
185,c# - UML and favourite IDE ,I've just downloaded Visual Paradigm for UML and it looks quite ok. Does anyone have any experience with it? Or maybe someone has his own favourite IDE which is worth using and wouldn't mind sharing this knowledge? Do not want to use IDE which is written in JAVA or C# for patriotic reasons.I would recommend you Visual Paradigm. It is has very intuitive interface and it is easy to use. I use it at the moment. But if you want to try something else this page could be helpful . The best modeling tool for Eclipse is Omondo.  It is just magic but also  !!
186,Zend Framework IDE ,I am assigned to work on a project which is developed in Zend Framework 1. I just know PHP language and I am studying the Zend Framework. I want to setup the Zend Framework project in IDE. I googled and came across Zend Studio which is paid. Is there any other community edition IDE in which I can work on the ZF1 project smoothly and can someone provide a link for the tutorial to setup the project?I would recommend using Eclipse for PHP:  Zend Studio is built on Eclipse and having used both myself I can tell you they are very similar.  Once you have Eclipse up and running you can add the Zend Framework 1 library so that you will have auto-complete and framework documentation available in real time.
197,IDE for elasticsearch ,I was searching extensively for having an IDE for elasticsearch. But I am unable to find one. I know it is simple Restclient will do but in most of the rest client the body editor doesnt have automatic indention and all. I was thinking If there is no IDE I can make one so that other people can also benefit from it. To make it I need how to create an editor? Any tools are available which will do proper json formatting while typing. IF that is there I can start a github project and start making an IDE. I can also add keywords of elastic search and it will easy for developers. IF that kind of thing is already there please point me to it. I am unable to find out one.The best option I have disovered so far is the Atom plugin . Elastic does not endorse promote or provide support for this application but works.
199,debugging - JavaScript IDE/Compiler ,"Now I hope some of you people will understand what I'm asking. I'm new to programming. I got introduced to JavaScript on Codecademy.com I use labs.codecademy.com for my JavaScript writing but it's limited. What IDE/Compiler can I use that's pretty simplistic in terms of being new to programming. Where I'm not surrounded by buttons that I don't know how to use yet. Does this even exist? A simple IDE?I think these two editors/IDEs are simple and good for beginners: More ""complicated"" but good javascript support: This is very subjective but nevertheless have look at this editors and choose what suites best for you. I hope I could help you. Notepad?  JavaScript doesn't have a compiler really.  Though there are ways of shrinking the code that some people call ""compiling"" but it isn't ""compiling"" in the strictest sense of the word. If you are looking for something JavaScript specific give  a try.  The personal license is $50 and I'm sure that while it will do more than you need right now it will grow with you. There is a 30 day trial. I was researching this exact question for my daughter. Like you she started learning JavaScript on Codecademy. She loves it but she is frequently frustrated when she doesn't understand why a program doesn't work. So I researched IDEs and debuggers and I read that Visual Studio has a debugger that is easy to use. But after installing 4 different versions I had to jump through lots of hoops to create a JavaScript project in Visual Studio Express 2013 and then I couldn't debug it. After a while I gave up and installed Eclipse. I have used Eclipse before and it's very powerful. I was originally looking for alternatives because I felt using Eclipse for JavaScript is kind of like using an airplane when all you need is a bicycle :) There are many versions and packages of Eclipse. I think this one might be the simplest to install:(Helios is a version and this specific package is for JavaScript developers) I actually used the latest version (Kepler). Unfortunately it doesn't have a package for JavaScript so I used the Java package:and then added JSDT: Yes Eclipse can be intimidating for a beginner but the good thing about Eclipse is that it works on multiple platforms you can find support for pretty much any language and it's free :) If you are serious about programming I recommend you invest a little time in learning how to use Eclipse. Let me know if this helps or if you have more questions."
208,C++ IDE that autogenerates cmakelists.txt ,I'm looking for an IDE that automatically generates a cmake file from the project. Ideally I would like the project to be independent of the IDE. I am mainly working under linux but Windows is a major (and great) OS so ideally it would run on Windows as well. I'm not too bothered about that though as on Windows there is VS :). Regards EDIT: Yeah I sort of see my mistake. I should have asked for an IDE that generates makefiles instead of cmake files since the cmake layer/step becomes useless (if the IDE can directly generate a makefile).The purpose of CMake is to generate the  file by hand - and KDevelop helpfully updates the GUI appropriately to reflect my changes.
215,IDE for php prado ,iam looking for IDE with intellisense support for PHP Prado. please suggest me some ide's. ------- iam looking for IDE with intellisense support for PHP Prado. Well I'm a Netbeans user and use multiple frameworks. If you use a framework and make sure that it's in your include-path Netbeans will automatically index the framework and provide intellisense for it. I don't think you need an IDE with framework specific intellisense I think you need an IDE that can do intellisense on existing frameworks :) How about Netbeans alfa version of Prado support : 
217,jquery php html ide recomendation ,  I'm developing with jquery/javascript css html and php and I would like to know if there is any IDE (even if plug-ins are required) that can give me context help (ctrl+space similar) in every language pointed out.I've been using Dreamwever but the completion help isn't as good as I'd like. If anyone could recomend a nice IDE I would be very appreciated.I always use NetBeans for my web development. It even has the option of automatically uploading everything you change (via FTP) every time you save it which is a great time saver. It has support for ctrl+space auto-complete and suggestions. PhpStorm is really good and it has zen coding support built in.  Aptana is always a good bet. Check it out.  NetBeans is awesome! It's absolutely free.

229,c++ - IDE for gcc compiler ,  I've downloaded MinGW and I require an IDE for compiler.I'm going for eclipse atm which one would you suggest?Eclipse is good. Netbeans is good. DevC++ is good. Now you choose :-) Eclipse is quite good haven't tried any other IDE so can't comment further  but I haven't used the combination myself.
233,C++ IDE on Linux ,We trying to choose an IDE for C++ development on Linux.The proposed options are KDevelop and Eclipse. Eclipse is highly customizable but Java centric and heavy.KDevelop is bounded to particular KDE (I believe because KDE API) and can not be replaced if required. What you use and why? ThanksDimaKDevelop because: Since you are comparing KDevelop with Eclipse let me also point out that: Also when I've used KDevelop I've been using it on Ubuntu which uses the Gnome desktop. On Gnome KDevelop still beats Eclipse in terms of startup time and is definitely worth using. Also one last note if you use CMake with KDevelop then you can distribute your source code to users on Windows Mac and Linux and they will be able to compile your source code even if they don't have KDevelop; CMake can generate a native Makefile a Visual Studio project an Xcode project or a KDevelop project. So the concern that you can't replace KDevelop really doesn't apply if you use the CMake backend. I use  works well as an IDE on linux given that it can be set up with integrated build and debugging. Code Blocks is an option I think the correct answer is to try both (and maybe others) for yourself. Personally I've used Eclipse for the past ~3 years. I'm satisfied with it but there are parts that I think could be better.  But I think your best bet is to install both and try them each for a week or 2 (maybe longer). A lot of this comes to do personal preference and taste. This is the 2009 version of the vi or emacs question :) I use CDT on eclipse I find it very responsive. Plus plugins like Subclipse Mylyn etc really make development a lot easier. I use Java and C++ together is some projects so the fact I can code Java/JNI/CPP in the one IDE makes life a lot easier in my opinion. If you are looking for light IDE you can try vim. With appropriate plug-ins and skills it might be very powerful. QtCreatorEclipseNetbeansKDevelop Each has strengths and weaknesses and it'll depend a lot on on what else you're doing. You can also try  \M/
242,python - Vpython in Wing IDE ,"I am using Wing IDE and I have installed VIDLE with Vpython. VIDLE works fine but if I want to use it on Wing IDE somehow it can't import the visual module. It always gives an error ""No module named visual"". How can I import the visual module into the IDE? I thought maybe the problem lies in the version of the Vpython or the Python itself. The installed Vpython is for Python 2.7 (I've tried another one for 3.4 but the VIDLE wouldn't work with it). Both Python 2.7 and 3.4 are installed on the PC but I don't even know which one is taken as default on the IDE. So if this really has something to do with the version how can I change the Python path on Wing IDE? Sorry I am quite new in Python and I've looked everywhere but didn't come to any helpful answer. Thank you in advance."
265,Glassfish IDE integration ,I am an Eclipse user.I am going to be using Glassfish on a project.Is the Glassfish IDE integration substantially better in NetBeans (or some other) or is the integration the same as Eclipse?with the full set of JavaEE plugins in Eclipse it's trivial to control/deploy to glassfish. Grab the JavaEE version of Eclipse and follow the wizard for creating a new enterprise application. Generally speaking unless you're debugging the only intergration you really need is: start stop deploy. You can make almost any IDE/script/buildfile do that. Stick with the IDE you're most productive in. I can't compare it to eclipse because I never tried it in eclipse but I can cast my vote for Netbeans integration. I've been using it for a while with Netbeans and I am very satisfied with the result. I stuck with Eclipse. Glassfish IDE integration is better with NetBeans.   The plugin for Eclipse isn't quite ready for primetime. My personal experience is that Eclipse with the Java EE extensions are more than sufficient for development and deployment of JAX-WS apps are faster in Eclipse than with Netbeans. The Glassfish plugin has forms for editing configuration for things as nuanced as WSIT WS-Security and WS-AtomicTransaction.  This speeds configuration.  However I've found that deploying a JAX-WS app performs ws-import more times than necessary which doubles deployment time.
266,c++ - IDE Font spacing problems ,I have been developing programs for a couple years now in Java and more recently C++.  Everything was going great until a couple months ago the font I was using in my editor suddenly got huge spaces between each letter making it almost unreadable.  For Java I used NetBeans IDE.  Now in my code I used the Papyrus font that I modified to be monospaced.  Gave my comments the hand written look while still being usable. A few months ago my comment spacing all of a sudden looked like it had a space between every character.  Figuring it was my fault when I modified the font I simply changed to a different font.  worked fine if a little less fun. Now as I am taking classes in C++ my instructor recommended Dev C++ IDE.  I know it is old but it is what I was told to use.  Now I am getting the same problem here only with all fonts.  Anyone know how to fix this? Screenshot: .This is what it Should look like:I had the same problem try changing your font family to

282,angular - Angular2 - how to start and with which IDE ,I have used AngularJS 1.x now for a couple of months. Now I will switch to Angular2 (with TypeScript) and actually I am not sure which IDE to use.It is also not clear for me how to compile the TypeScript Code into JavaScript - actually is this necessary?I have read that Visual Studio Code would be a nice editor for Angular2 projects - is there a TypeScript compiler included? I would be glad for any information in this direction. I was wondering myself which IDE is the best suited for Angular2. I'm a big > (+ Typescript plugin).Better BUT no support for auto import (maybe it has some now ?) and also I had to wait 30s before I get any autocompletion. Then I tried Webstorm as the company I'm currently working at has some licences. It was great and I was really happy for a month. But using an editor that is not free felt ... weird. I wouldn't use it at home for personal projects I couldn't recommend it to other people easily. And honnestly I'm not a super fan of Webstorm interface. So I gave (another) try to  that I didn't find so great when I first tried it few months ago. It has seriously evolved and :- it's simple- it's complete   - Code   - Debugger (remote --&gt; super powerful)   - Git integration   - Plugin store- it has great great Angular2 support- intellisense is really awesome I'm using it since a month and so far I'm really happy and do not feel the need to change. Just to help you start with good plugins here's mine : Angular-cli compiles your Typescript and even your (sccs|sass|less) files. When you want to deploy your app : Will also minimify JS and CSS.  Once you feel more comfortable with Angular2 in general I'd strongly recommend you to learn (more) about- -

285,What IronPython IDE should I use? ,"This question probably looks a lot like  that integrates with Visual Studio.  It was a logical choice for me because I use Visual Studio when I work with C#. One of the problem I have with IronPython Studio is that I cannot change the default colors.  I have a dark gray background color and black Python code doesn't look very good on that background.  I looked in Environment-&gt;Fonts and Colors in Option dialog but couldn't find the option to change IronPython colors.  Let it be my side question:How to change default colors in integrated IronPython Studio? I heard about SharpDevelop but I don't know if it's going to be a big improvement of IronPython Studio.  I decided to ask you before I'll try it. So please could you please let me know of pros and cons of your favorite IronPython IDE.  Don't tell me ""I use XYZ IDE and love it"".  I want to know why you love it and what it's missing. ThanksMichael Foord has compared different IDEs for IronPython. You can find it ."
287,c# - Looking for an online IDE ,I have been looking for a fairly decent online IDE that does well with both c# and java I have tried Cloud9IDE CodeRun and Amy Editor.  I really had liked CodeRun until i found that it was impossible for me to add another file into the same project unless i was just doing it wrong which is possible.  Amy Editor was very promising also until i couldn't figure out how to create a new project or compile the sample code i had written.  If anyone knows how to use these editors or of any other good online IDE environments then I'm game to learn.Why not run your IDE somewhere on a machine and connect to it remotely? You can even install your own Virtual Desktop on Amazon EC2 for example so you don't have to run the machine yourself. For an idea on how to do this see ? I think it's only been up and running for a few months but it's a pretty good website not sure if it meets your functionality needs though.
294,eclipse - IDE for Java Swing ,"I'm trying to learn how to build a basic GUI using Java Swing. Right now I know literally nothing about it but I'm going through . The first thing I noticed right off the bat was the title: ""Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE."" Up till now I thought an IDE was basically just something that you could write and run code within (I've been using Eclipse) Why does this tutorial specifically encourage the use of NetBeans? Edit: And can I just keep using Eclipse?Maybe because Oracle owns/creates NetBeans. "
295,java - Eclipse IDE Scope Highlighting? ,"When I first learned Java I was using an IDE called ""BlueJ."" It had this feature called ""Scope Highlighting"" which made it very easy to read blocks of code. Now I've moved on from BlueJ and began using Eclipse. I'm currently in the process of customizing Eclipse to my liking and would like this Scope Highlighting feature inside Eclipse. I've searched everywhere for an answer on how to do it but I cannot find any information pointing to a solution for doing it in Eclipse. Here's a picture to demonstrate what Scope Highlighting looks like: I'm afriad that closest you can get is  It is selecting wider block of code. pressing this few times will give you very similar result to what you are searching for. I use it often.. it is useful also for refactoring.EDIT: As @j2emanue said:  I think the best option for you is EditBox a scope highlighting plugin for Eclipse: This isn't exactly what you're after but you can put your cursor in a method and then click the Show Source Of Selected Element only button on the toolbar. Your editor gets reduced to just that method. Click again and your back to your entire file."

317,python - Does Django need an IDE? ,"My company is evaluating the possibility of developing a specialized IDE for Django.  So we would like to ask Django users:  Do you feel the need for a specialized IDE for Django? Would you be willing to pay for it or would you only consider free a open-source product?  What Django-specific features are you missing currently in your development tools?It's great that your company wants to contribute to the community but I have to say that I don't see what a 'Django IDE' would achieve. There are already plugins for all the main editors and IDEs to support Django - from Vim to TextMate to NetBeans - and these provide syntax highlighting indentation shortcuts and snippets for both Python source and Django templates. These can always do with more work of course so perhaps your efforts would be best focused on improving one of these. I would pay a reasonable amount for a Django-tailored IDE or plug-in. I don't know what I mean by reasonable but maye it helps to know that I would not pay more than $75 and I would only pay the $75 if the tool was really awesome. Now Django specific features: If I can think of anything else I will edit the answer. Good luck in designing your product! I am using Komodo Edit and it's very good. There is a lot of good open-sources product so i don't think that I would buy a commercial product.  Maybe a very good and easy-to-use debugger would make me change my mind.  I hope it helps.  You'll likely want an IDE that will provide you with the ability to do source-level debugging of your accompanying Python code. Without it your productivity will really be below what it could be. I use  but vice-versa. yes I will donate. I would definitely pay or donate for a pure Django IDE even tho there are already some existing plugins I feel something is always ""floating"". "
320,Android Studio vs. Eclipse IDE? ,"Google just announced the latest release of the newest Android IDE called Android Studio.

Also it has """" but Eclipse has a plug-in for it right? Regards."
342,Ruby IDE (from a Visual Studio background) ,For a university I was advised to learn Ruby before starting. I have a strong .NET background (with C#) and would like to find an IDE for Ruby. I'm currently very familiar with/used to VS2010 and VS2012.I find  have plugins for Ruby between the two I personally prefer Netbeans but I only use them for Java programming. For Ruby I use Vim which you can customize into whatever needs you have. All the people I know use a text editor for Ruby (at my company either Vim or Sublime Text 2). Not that Ruby programmers can't use an IDE but they generally don't. If you're looking to learn Ruby might be worth trying it out without a full fledged IDE. If you already have Visual Studio 2010 installed (seems to always be installed as part of other Microsoft Tools) Ruby In Steel 2.0 is definitely worth a look. Sure it's using an older shell but it's fast and familiar.
367,React Native online IDE ,I'm interested in learning React Native however I have old amd computer which can't run Anroid Simulator. Is there any online IDE with android emulator for React Native? I would like to be able to compile app.I know I can run it on AWS but unfortunately I don't have credit card. I can pay with paypal.You can run it from snack.io. From your browser exactly your will get a simulator and an editor. However you can run projects only created in your snack account. CHECK OUT expo.com before you proceed.
381,python sleep == IDE lock up ,When my script sleeps for 50sec my IDE locks up which is very annoying. I cant switch tabs look through my source type code etc. It happens in pylde and pyscripter i havent tried other IDEs. What can i do to fix this? i'm actually doing  hoping the IDE will update once per second but it doesnt look that way. What can i do to fix this?I'm assuming you are running your code from within the IDE? Your IDE is probably blocking while running your code. Look for a setting of some sort which might control that behaviour otherwise I think your only choice would be to change IDE. (Or run your code from outside the IDE) Can you configure to run your script externally? I don't know about the specific IDEs but I would try to spawn a different process for the debugged script and not run them under the IDE. If that doesn't help then it is a problem of the IDEs. The problem is your IDE not python. I don't use sleep that often I've just tried it on the  IDE uses the background thread approach and it does not have this problem.

I'm running Windows 7 x86 professional.  can JIT C++Visual Studio can JIT C++/CLI (which isn't quite C++) (RMartinho corrects that VIsual Studio compiles C++/CLI to IL and then JITs the IL.

416,android studio - IDE Fatal Errors ,I am new to Android Development and I was doing this exercise where you create a basic Activity (Android 4.4 kitkat) and remove the TextView and add a ListView in a CoordinatorLayout and program the Floating action Button in such a way that Each time you click it it adds current time date/month/year in the list.

439,java - Terminal based IDE ,I'm looking for a IDE that supports java and is based over terminal. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and it doesn't have any gui installed and I'd prefer to keep it that way. However I'd also like to code on it and connect to it from other computers using SSH to code on there to provide a lightweight and fast IDE. It has to be able to edit compile and test Java on the spot and more languages if possible. It would be nice if it had support for multiple projects and had a collapsible project browser like in netbeans and most IDE's. Does anyone know anything that meets the requirements? I'd love something like  however thats only for android. is the only example I can think of. You might be able to get along with vim but there will be a lot of  shell calls.
440,eclipse - Error in scala IDE ,I not really understand what this error means? This is occur when I delete some source file. Is there any good IDE for scala development beside eclipse? If you delete a file sometimes the IDE doesn't catch that it needs to recompile and so it gets confused about what happened to the file.   To fix go to  and clean the project.  This will force it to inspect the files and recompile.

It went to fast if you put Selenium on ' Slow mode ' it went fine just on fast it sweeped over it. I think is better  without ""pause"" (performance) I found this way Ruby code: "
465,Is there a C++ IDE which handles templates well? ,Every IDE I've tried fails to provide code-completion when something template-related is used.For example  Is there IDE that can provide code completion in this case?Actually this is a fairly simple template use-case ) handles this pretty well. Netbeans sometimes gets it right but not always. It's non-deterministic: seemingly similar code may get parsed or not depending on the whim of the IDE.

484,Looking for OCaml IDE ,"I like F# but sometimes I need something light and cross-platform and without .NET for sure.I tried to use OCamL many times but seems like I just can't start it. So for now I'm using ocamlc -o ""main.exe"" ""main.ml"" from the command shell and different light editors. I don't use Vim or Emacs I'm using nano and I have a habit of usage full-featured IDEs. I found various documentation (this is looking like the best to start  with strange api annotation and no examples. And all the documentation about IDE usage I found are outdated or doesn't work. Addition subquestion: some people told me ""don't use OCamL it's a dead language for students with low libraries support and seems like dying use python or ruby instead"". But I like the beauty of OCamL. I want to give it a try. Tell me if that is normal to use OCamL for production code today? thank you.There is  as the first result. Haven't tested it though so I can't really say if it is recommendable or not."

490,eclipse - Java source code management with different IDE ,Is it necessary to use the same ide to program in java? For example I use IntelliJ to build a small java project about 2000 lines. Then the marker uses Eclipse IDE to mark this project. Does he need to import all the source code into a new project and set up everything for it?  I didn't use any add-on on this IDE. The reason I asked this question because I receive huge grade duction for using different IDE the prof response me and said marker need rebuild everything for using different ide.  I drag my source code into Eclipse and it works very well so I am confused am I right or wrong?
493,eclipse - Fast and interactive PHP IDE? ,"  Could you recommend me a PHP IDE? I've tried Notepad++ (a great text editor but.. just a text editor) and NetBeans. I've worked with Eclipse on Java too. I like NetBeans but like Eclipse it is so damn slow. Recently it started lagging every 3 seconds or so.. Most important features are: Auto-tab auto-completion of opened functions HTML tags syntax highlight auto-generation of comments for functions function and class hints (it should be able to ""look"" into my classes and their methods like NetBeans). So basicaly I am looking for a NetBeans-like lightweight text editor :) Any ideas?I haven't tried it myself but I've heard many people raving about  which I would describe as a lightweight IDE.  It's not as feature-laden as Netbeans/Eclipse but is quickly to its set with every update. vim on the other hand is as lightweight as it gets but by default probably doesn't have all the goodies you're looking for.  However if you're willing to spend the time configing and installing plugins you can make it whatever you want. I'd go for Netbeans but since you don't want it most programmers praised (and still praise)EMACS . Emacs is available for every platform. Some people consider it to be the best. Truth is that it is very fast auto-completion of your code and many other features. It takes a few days to get used to the powerful shortcuts but once you're done with it I guess you'll find it very smooth. You only need to install the application and activate the PHP plugin (or else if needed). Hope this helped. I have moved from Netbeans to PHPStorm and quite satisfied by features you can automate and so far it is much smarter on guessing what I'm typing.In my opinion Netbeans is more about Java programming and PHP feature behave as a little addon.Before Netbeans I was playing with PHPDesigner also nice and fast IDE for a reasonable price."
