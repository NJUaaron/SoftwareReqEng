1,performance - Why is the Android emulator so slow? How can we speed up the Android emulator? ,I have got a  should start fairly quickly on such a machine but for me it does not. I have followed all the instructions in setting up the IDE SDKs JDKs and such and have had some success in starting the emulator quickly but that is very rare. How can I if possible fix this problem? Even if it starts and loads the home screen it is very sluggish. I have tried the  (Ganymede). Currently it supports only Intel® VT (Intel Virtualization Technology). The Android emulator is based on . The interface between QEMU and the HAXM driver on the host system is designed to be vendor-agnostic. Update Eclipse:Make sure your Eclipse installation and the ADT plug-in are fully up-to-date. Update your Android Tools:After each Eclipse plug-in update it is important to update your Android SDK Tools. To do this launch the Android SDK Manager and update all the Android SDK components. To take advantage of HAXM you must be on at least release version 17. C:\ProgramFiles\Android\android-sdk\extras\intel\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_ManagerFor those still interested:Try using  on May 15 2012.  This worked for me. The emulator is now fast and the UI is smooth. The first half of the instructions are detailed enough so I will assume you were able to install the Intel x86 Atom System Image(s) using the Android SDK manager as well as Intel HAXM. Now to ensure that everything else is set up so you can enjoy a highly performing emulator: And start it: If HAXM is working properly you may see this message when launching the emulator: HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virtual mode Otherwise you may see this error: HAX is not working and the emulator runs in emulation mode emulator:   Failed to open the hax module  (Gingerbread)).Developing on a Mac would be better. Why use an emulator BTW? Using a real phone makes more sense. As of Revision 17 of Android SDK Tools the emulator can use graphic acceleration and CPU-provided extensions for better efficiency. The prerequisites and full configuration and user notes are at:    After these changes Android Emulator was launching in 5-10 seconds and running without any noticeable lag.Be aware that these features are hardware dependent (CPU/GPU) and may not work on some systems. A new option is the  file you've deployed. Android emulator is dead slow. It takes 800MB memory while running.If you are on Windows You can use Microsoft Android Emulator. It is superb provides you functionalities more than Android Studio Emulator. And most important it is fast ( consumes 13MB only).It comes with Visual Studio 2015 Technical Preview. I am using it and happy with it. I downloaded and installed entire VS pack I need to look how we can install VS Emulator only.  EDIT:Try  version and then go to app open Settings/Preferences the go to Build Execution Deployment → Instant Run. Click on Enable Instant Run. And After That This will ensure you have the correct gradle plugin for your project to work with Instant Run. And Instant run will look like this  However Android Studio is right now in Preview you can try it now.
2,What IDE to use for Python? ,"What IDEs (""GUIs/editors"") do others use for Python coding?"
3,vim - Why should I use an IDE? ,"In another question  speaks highly of IDEs saying ""some people still just dont know ""why"" they should use one..."".  As someone who uses vim for programming and works in an environment where most/all of my colleagues use either vim or emacs for all of their work what are the advantages of IDEs?  Why should I use one? I'm sure this is a charged issue for some people and I'm not interested in starting a flame war so .  I'm not interested in hearing about why I shouldn't use an IDE; I already don't use one.  I'm interested in hearing from ""the other side of the fence"" so to speak. If you think that IDEs may be suitable for some types of work but not others I'm also interested to hear why.It really depends on what language you're using but in C# and Java I find IDEs beneficial for: All of these save time. They're things I could do manually but with more pain: I'd rather be coding. Code completion. It helps a lot with exploring code. The short answer as to why I use an IDE is laziness. I'm a lazy soul who doesn't like to do things a difficult way when there is an easy way to do it instead. IDE's make life easy and so appeal to us lazy folk. As I type code the IDE automatically checks the validity of the code I can highlight a method and hit F1 to get help right click and select ""go to to definition"" to jump straight to where it is defined. I hit one button and the application with debugger automatically attached is launched for me. And so the list goes on. All the things that a developer does on a day to day basis is gathered under one roof. There is no need to use an IDE. It is just much harder work not to. I don't think it's fair to do the classic ""text editor and console window vs IDE"" when ""text editor"" is really emacs. Most features that are typical for IDE:s are also in emacs. Or perhaps they even originated there and modern IDE:s are mainly interface improvements/simplifications. This means that for the original question the answer is not so clear-cut. It depends on > power of Vim using something like the  and Emacs fulfil many functions any IDE will give you. The only aspect they do not handle that a larger IDE may are things like UI designers. Then your question boils down to simply ""what IDE should I use"" with arguments to be made for the simpler realm of Vim and Emacs. For me an IDE is better because it allows faster navigation in code which is important if you have something in your mind to implement.Supposed you do not use an IDE it takes longer to get to the destination. Your thoughts may be interupted more often. It means more clicks/more keys have to be pressed.One has to concentrate more on the thought how to implement things.Of course you can write down things too but then one must jump between the design and implementation.Also a GUI designer makes a big difference. If you do that by hand it may take longer. GUI-based IDEs like Visual Studio and Eclipse have several advantages over text-based IDEs like Emacs or vim because of their display capabilities: Basically with a GUI-based IDE you can get more useful information on screen at once and you can view/edit graphical portions of of your application as easily as text portions. One of the coolest things to experience as a developer is editing a method that computes some data and seeing the live output of your code displayed graphically in another window just as your user will see it when you run the app.  Now that's WYSIWYG editing! Text-based IDEs like Emacs and vim can add features like code completion and refactoring over time so in the long run their main limitation is their text-based display model. I also almost exclusively use Vim (almost because I'm trying to learn emacs now) for all my development stuff. I think sheer intuitiveness (from the GUI of course) is the primary reason why people like to use IDEs. By being intuitive little to no learning overhead of the tool is required. The lesser the learning overhead the more they can get work done. An  allows one to work faster and more easily... I noticed I spent a lot of time navigating in the code in a simple text editor... In a good IDE that time goes down if the IDE supports jumping to functions to previous editing positionto variables... Also a good IDE reduces the time to experiment with different language features and projects as the start-up time can be small. A couple of reasons I can think of for using an IDE: And quite frankly I like my mouse. When I use pure text-based editors it gets lonely. Saves time to developMakes life easier by providing features like Integrated debugging intellisense. There are lot many but will recommend to use one they are more than obvious. I'm not sure there's a clear dividing line between a text editor and an IDE. You have the likes of Notepad at one end of the scale and the best modern IDEs at the other but there are a lot of thing in between. Most text editors have syntax highlighting; editors aimed at programmers often have various other features such as easy code navigation and auto complete. Emacs even lets you integrate a debugger. The IDEs of even ten years ago had far less features to help programmers than you'd expect of a serious text editor these days. My main  reason to use one is when the code goes beyond 100 files. Although ctags can do the work  have a pretty good way to navigate the files easily an super fast. It saves time when you have a lot of work to do. To me it's just the the GUI version of everything we did in the good old days of the terminal. I will always agree that IDE are not very superior because they hide a lot of stuff especially concerning the linking stuff but they have a notable advantage in some cases for example with certain development platforms like Qt. Some IDE like visual of others even seem to parse your code as you type it and detect errors before you even compile: it seems logics that only an IDE can work closely with a compiler to immediately detect problem in the typed source. My wild answer that the IDE/Command-line flame war exists is just because the C/C++ executable building is not very well handled from a standardized point of view unlike with the D language; every platform handles compiling/linking/etc its own way so to make it less messy they make an IDE. From your viewpoint it might be more simple to use the command-line if there would have been only one compiler with standard options it would have been easy but the truth is C/C++ is flexible so in the end all platform do it their own way hence the IDE to not waste explaining how to do it. If you can learn how an executable talks to the kernel or if you know anything about compiler design maybe there is a way to work with a proper command-line but I doubt you have. Microsoft or Apple all evil they would be have to propose a straight-forward way to build application without entering in the details and since building an application depends directly on the architecture of the OS it will hardly be ""standard"" as the command-line is. To put it simple big and complex applications where you don't want to dig too deep into what it does -&gt; IDE little pieces of software or simple system software-design -&gt; command-line. Except of course those nifty libraries that embed a Makefile but that's another story. Also I think IDE are used when the application delivered has something to do with ironically a GUI or something that has an interface or is directly bound to an OS so again it's also for people who will use a UI/GUI without knowing how it works while people who will program systems won't need it all. IDE is just modern shit but I think in 100 years the command-line will still exist. I like an IDE because it puts a lot of functionality at my fingertips.  Editing/Compilation/visibility of files in the project are all things I value in an IDE.  I use Visual Studio now but in a former life I used SlickEdit and found that it made my development process more streamlined than when I wasn't using it. There's only one thing to consider when deciding whether to use an IDE or not and that's whether it makes you more productive or not. Short question so short answer :) It depends highly on what you're doing and what language you're doing it in.  Personally I tend to not use an IDE (or ""my IDE consists of 3 xterms running vim one running a database client and one with a bash prompt or tailing logs"" depending on how broadly you define ""IDE"") for most of my work but if I were to find myself developing a platform-native GUI then I'd reach for a language-appropriate IDE in an instant - IMO IDEs and graphical form editing are clearly made for each other."
4,Rename package in Android Studio ,"How do you rename packages in the new IDE Android Studio based on IntelliJ IDEA? Is there an automatic refactoring included?  I want to make bulk refactoring but I don't know how. I worked two years with Eclipse and in Eclipse it's a one-click operation.For example if you want to change  attribute in your manifest. Clean and Rebuild.  (which is now independent of the package name) can be done very easily in one step. You don't have to touch AndroidManifest.Instead do the following:  Note this will > change the package name. The decoupling of Package Name and Application ID is explained here: The approach used by me for renaming the package name is simple as follows:- : Select the Project option from left menu of Android Studio  : Right click on java and add a new package and set the desired package name  : Enter you new packagename  :Copy all the files from your old package and paste in the new package  :Rename the package name in manifest file  :Rename the package name in build.gradle file  :Then right click the old package and delete it with all its data and delete that directory as well  :Then Rebuild your project  :Then you will find some errors of old import packagename in your project :Then a popup appears like below and select All files option from it  :Rebuild your project again bingo your project packagename has been changed :) Place your cursor in the package name like shown below. Don't select it just place it.  Then press  you will get a popup window as shown below select.(Note since my cursor is on ""something"" only something is renamed.) That's it done. Right-click on the package at the  If your package name is more than two dot separated say  you might DO the following steps to refactoring your package name(s) in Android Studio or IntelliJ: then refactor them by moving them to com and com.hello respectively.   You will see com and com.hello sitting there at the Project(   or  for shortcut) and rename directories refactoring is   waiting there as you expected. Refactor to rename one or more of these directories to reach your aim. The only thing you should notice here is you must choose the directories rather than Packages when a dialog ask you. If you've got lots of classes in your project it will take you a while to wait for its auto-scan-and-rename. Besides you need to rename the package name inside the AndroidManifest.xml manually I guess such that other names in this file can benefit the prefix.  and then insert the desired package name. 2- Open  to the desired package  name. Select option  Uncheck the Compact Empty Middle Packages option. Renaming directory crl to crl1 Finally click on Do Refactor button marked in image belowenter code here After Changes done Please try the following steps: *******Finally it’s done ******   Press  has always worked for me.Simply . It should be fine from here. The best way is to write the new package name and drag from the older package name. The second way if you click > then move option then rename the package name it will rename the package name and then rebuild.

Choose  for plain text search in workspace/selected projects Open any file quickly without browsing for it in the PackageExplorer: Open a type (e.g.: a class an interface) without clicking throughinterminable list of packages: Go directly to a member (method variable) of a huge class fileespecially when a lot of methods are named similarly:  is the best way! Remember to copy the string before you start searching!  Open  Search Dialog  is actually pretty important.When you have last clicked on file you're working on you'll get a different search window - ::yes but you need to open the global search panel.to do so press the binoculars icon on the top right corner of the IDE.  you can even filter searches by function identifiers method scopes an etc... First customize your search dialog.  Incremental search forward / backwards. Type search term after pressing  there is now search windowEclipse will restrict the search result using the Resource Filters defined for your project (eg. right click on you project name and select Properties -&gt; Resource -&gt; Resource Filters). So if you keep getting search hits from parts of your project that your not interested in you could make Eclipse skip those by adding a Resource Filter for them. This is especially useful if you have build files or logs or other temporary files that are part of your projects directory structure but you only want to search amongst the source code. You should also be aware of that files/directories matched for exclusion in the Resource Filters will not show up in the Package Explorer either so you might not always want this. What others have forgotten is   It updates as quickly as you can type and allows for quick navigation using only the keyboard.   A typical workflow starts by pressing the keyboard shortcut   (or   Typing a few letters updates the search result as you type.  Use Up-Down arrow keys to select a match then hit "

At the time this was impossible: no good IDE existed.

It supports large code-bases well without slowing down or spending all its time indexing. (This is a problem I had with eclipse's cdt).  Slickedit's speed is probably the nicest thing about it actually.The code completion works well and there are a large amount of options for things like automatic formatting beautification and refactoring.It does have integrated debugging.It has plug-in support and fairly active community creating them.In theory you should be able to integrate well with people doing the traditional makefile stuff as it allows you to create a project directly from one but that didn't work as smoothly as I would have liked when I tried it.In addition to Linux there are Mac and Windows versions of it should you need them.It's been a month since I started using Vim as my main 'GUI'tool for programming C++ in Linux.

I'm also > closing this question so people can stillreact or maybe even add new suggestions or additions to thealready really nice answers... I recommend you read :   If you like Eclipse for Java I suggest Eclipse CDT. Despite C/C++ support isn't so powerful as is for Java it still offers most of the features. It has a nice feature named Managed Project that makes working with C/C++ projects easier if you don't have experience with Makefiles. But you can still use Makefiles.I do C and Java coding and I'm really happy with CDT. I'm developing the firmware for a embedded device in C and a application in Java that talks to this device and is really nice to  use the same environment for both. I guess it probably makes me more productive. I love how people completely miss the request in the original question for an IDE.  Linux is NOT an IDE.  That's just not what those words mean.  I learned c and c++ using vi and gcc and make and I'm not saying they aren't adequate tools but they are NOT an IDE.  Even if you use more elaborate tools like vim or emacs or whatever fancy editor you want typing commands on a command line is not an IDE. Also you all know make exists as part of visual studio right?  The idea that an IDE is ""limiting"" is just silly if you can use the IDE to speed some things yet are still able to fall back on command line stuff when needed. All that said I'd suggest as several above have trying Code blocks.  Its got decent code highlighting a pretty effortless way to create a project code it run it etc that is the core of a real IDE and seems fairly stable.  Debugging sucks...I have never seen a decent interactive debugger in any linux/unix variant.  gdb ain't it.  If you're used to visual studio style debugging you're pretty much out of luck. Anyway I'll go pack my things I know the one-view-only linux crowd will shout this down and run me out of town in no time. make + vim + gdb = one great IDE I quite like  for Eclipse could fill your needs? The Linux Tools project aims to bring a full-featured C and C++ IDE to Linux developers. We build on the source editing and debugging features of the CDT and integrate popular native development tools such as the GNU Autotools Valgrind OProfile RPM SystemTap GCov GProf LTTng etc. Current projects include LTTng trace viewers and analyzers an RPM .spec editor Autotools build integration a Valgrind heap usage analysis tool and OProfile call profiling tools.

I'd mostly agree but the problem is also one of perception: we forget how difficult it was to become productive in any chose IDE (or other environment).  I find IDE's (Visual Studio NetBeans Eclipse) amazingly cumbersome in so many ways. As an old-time UNIX guy I always use Emacs.

As described in  the impact of runtime annotationsis smaller than one might think but they have the benefitof enabling tools to do runtime checks in addition to thecompile time ones.  Another important difference is > in the code the annotations can be used.There are two different approaches. Some packages use JLS 9.6.4.1 style contexts.

The annotation processor provides additional assurance during the software development process that the information conveyed by the application of these annotations is accurate including in cases of method inheritance. One of the nice things about IntelliJ is that you don't need to use their annotations. You can write your own or you can use those of whatever other tool you like. You're not even limited to a single type. If you're using two libraries that use different @NotNull annotations you can tell IntelliJ to use both of them. To do this go to ""Configure Inspections"" click on the ""Constant Conditions &amp; Exceptions"" inspection and hit the ""Configure inspections"" button. I use the Nullness Checker wherever I can so I set up IntelliJ to use those annotations but you can make it work with whatever other tool you want.

There is also an .epf File for the Chrome Theme plugin preferences you should import.You can get it from my dropbox:   In the end your eclipse will look like this:I've build a win 7 dark theme base on the popular windows 7 'concave 7' theme for eclipse dark juno theme.And I also create a dark theme inspired from the editor color theme 'Zenburn' created by Janni Nurmin Here are photos of this theme: All settings of this theme is available on github: (I use guari and retta and I think that looks real good :)  I hope that it will  help someone :) Darkest Dark is the best dark theme.It also comes with different toolbar icon shapes. Here's the link :  I use the below adjusted 'Smart Inversion Alt 2' matrix where the black is lightened a little."
11,javascript - How do I get started with Node.js ,Are there any good resources to get started with Node.JS? Any good tutorials blogs or books? Of course I have visited its official website  but I didn't think the documentation they have is a good starting point. Use the source Luke. No but seriously I found that building Node.js from source running the tests and looking at the benchmarks did get me on the right track. From there the .js files in the lib directory are a good place to look especially the file http.js. Update: I wrote this answer over a year ago and since that time there has an explosion in the number of great resources available for people learning Node.js. Though I still believe diving into the source is worthwhile I think that there are now better ways to get started. I would suggest some of the books on Node.js that are starting to come out.
12,python - Django development IDE ,I have done a little Django development but it has all been in a text editor. I was curious what more advanced development tools others are using in their Django development. I am used to using Visual Studio for development and really like the  code completion and file organization it provides and would like to find something (or a combination of tools) that would provide some of this in the Django/Python environment.I use Eclipse and a plain vanilla  Ulipad is a good one. myself. The new version of PyDev has some pretty awesome code completion support. Since I > use Eclipse for PyDev I use a slim install of just the Platform Runtime Binary + PyDev + Subclipse. 
13,What is the best project structure for a Python application? ,Imagine that you want to develop a non-trivial end-user desktop (not web) application in Python. What is the best way to structure the project's folder hierarchy? Desirable features are ease of maintenance IDE-friendliness suitability for source control branching/merging and easy generation of install packages. In particular:Doesn't too much matter.  Whatever makes you happy will work.  There aren't a lot of silly rules because Python projects can be simple. And the top-level directory can contain README's Config's and whatnot. The hard choice is whether or not to use a ).
14,eclipse - What is the best IDE to develop Android apps in? ,I am about to start developing an android app and need to get an IDE. Eclipse and the android eclipse plugin appears to be the natural choice. However I am familiar with intelliJ and re-sharper so I would prefer use intelliJ.  Has anyone used ? Is this any good? Should I just bite the bullet and learn Eclipse? IntelliJ now has support for Android. See  is the best option for android. i have used both eclipse and intellij and found intellij is much easier to use with android as compared to eclipse because of these reasons :- Intellij provides a built-in support for android and you don't have to configure it as you need to do with eclipse.Intellij gives you auto-lookup feature which is really important for developer like us to increase our productivity. And if we talk about eclipse you have to type each and every method classname etc on your own. (May be eclipse has this feature too but i never found it and trust me i tried to find it like anything)Its much more user friendly and easy to use than eclipse.I hope it will help you and other members of stack overflow to decide which IDE is best for Android development. My personal choice is Intellij. - visual editor. IDEA has one as well but it's rather primitive. I suspect that this feature will soon be deleted as IDEA will improve its editor.- many projects into one right pane (this is also my personal con as I like IDEA's one-project-per-pane thing)- faster compiles Android projects. IDEA has made its compilation process faster so I also soon expect to delete this Eclipse pro - faster intellisense (if you like Resharper then you know what I am talking about)- smarter autocomplete - my friend and I decided to write the same class. I finished before him simply because IDEA faster reacts to my wishes- incredibly smart - do not know what to do? just press Ctrl+Shift+Space and IDEA will tell you what should come there. It also recognizes naming scheme to if you're filling  method.- will add more as I remember of them   - Still the only con is that if you open Eclipse Android project and edit any XML layout file Eclipse will no longer be able to display edited file into its visual layout editor. This has not been fixed as of this day and it's IDEA's bug as it somehow messes the XML. Bottom line: if you're a person who does not see advantages of ReSharper in .NET (and we all coded in .NET) then you'll probably stick to Eclipse. It's official Android IDE and you believe it's the best.If you liked ReSharper and want to code faster then you'll appreciate IDEA and will stick to it forever.  An IDE which supports Android development is  - great for anyone familiar with Basic  Eclipse and Netbeans are both horrible slow and I'ts a miracle that even the serious developers has been sticking with it for years not even try to stick with a better product. Java as platform is a shame when it comes to non-handheld platforms (winmaclinux) and if anyone are going to develop on the platform I say do what else but do not use Java at all. For mobility it's probably has a kind of good luck here as the systems are more down-scaled. As far I know there aren't any existing IDE for Java which aren't iself written in a Java environment. This is horrible because Java is messing up the desktop  environment.  I'm willing to spend hours on google to find an Java IDE/Editor which are capable for android projects but will use a native environment for itself. I Feel Eclipse IDE is more suitable for android applications rather than other IDEs.Because its providing us more than five perspectives which will make our project flexible and ease.You may try Eclipse ides starts with 3.6 and above will provide you better performance.  which are all latest and supports all kind of access. I am a huge supporter of using the environment that is most familiar to you. However this isn't always the best option. In some cases a different environment can result in (far?) greater efficency in the long run. In this particular case I suspect that sticking with what you already know is a good option but someone starting new would benifit from the easy setup and sdk/ndk integration offered by eclipse. I also don't know how available geolocation manipulation (or phone state manipulation - ie incoming call etc) is in other IDE's but integration within eclipse feels seamless.  that i worked with that. you can try it.
15,How do you split and unsplit a window/view in Eclipse IDE? ,How do you split a window/view in Eclipse IDE? I want to edit code while viewing the different code in the same file. If there is a trick to open the same file twice this might do but I would rather just split the one current view instead of having two of the same which might get confusing.This is possible with the menu items . That works on Eclipse Juno or higher.For the previous Eclipse versions check  out Simply go to Window &gt; New Window This will open up a new window of the same Workspace in eclipse.  You can open up separate files in each Window. Below are the steps to  editor horizontally or verticallygo to:  to split editor horizontally or to split editor vertically. It will open two editors side by side or will pileup tow. If you want to see two different files in same eclipse you can Right-click a tab -&gt;  to tabs again.
16,java - How to increase IDE memory limit in IntelliJ IDEA on Mac? ,"I'm using IDEA 12 Leda on Mountain Lion. I wanted to increase the maximum memory that IDE can use. I set the VMOptions in Info.plist file to be come from? I need to remove it.Since IDEA 15.0.4 you can use  is no longer recommended as the signature will not match and you will get issues depending on your system security settings (app will either not run or firewall will complain on every start or the app will not be able to use the system keystore to save passwords). As a result of addressing  a new way to supply JVM options was introduced in IDEA 12: Now it can take VM options from   and system properties  from  setting.  As for the intellij2018 version I am using the following configuration for better performance go to that path ""C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA 12.1.4\bin\idea.exe.vmoptions"" and change size to -Xmx512m hope its will work OSX 10.9 if you dont bother about signed application you might just change It looks like IDEA solves this for you (like everything else).  When loading a large project and letting it thrash it will open a dialog to up the memory settings.  Entering 2048 for Xmx and clicking ""Shutdown"" then restarting IDEA makes IDEA start up with more memory.  This seems to work well for Mac OS though it never seems to persist for me on Windows (not sure about IDEA 12). On my machine this only works in  causes the IDEA to hang during startup. Some addition to the top answer here "
17,Why is debugging better in an IDE? ,"I've been a software developer for over twenty years programming in C Perl SQL Java  PHP JavaScript and recently Python.  I've never had a problem I could not debug using some careful thought and well-placed debugging  statements? Can you suggest resources (tutorials books screencasts) that show the finer techniques of IDE debugging? Sweet answers!  Thanks much to everyone for taking the time.  Very illuminating.  I voted up many and voted none down.   Some notable points:Some examples of some abilities that an IDE debugger will give you over trace messages in code: In summary print statements are (generally) > toolkit at your fingertips. When I first started coding I couldn't understand what the big deal with debuggers was and I thought I could achieve anything with tracing (granted that was on unix and the debugger was GDB).  But once you learn how to properly use a graphical debugger you don't want to go back to print statements. An IDE debugger lets you change thevalues of variables at run-time.  An IDEdebugger lets you see the value ofvariables you didn't know you wantedto see when execution began.  An IDEdebugger lets you see the call stackand examine the state of thefunction passed weird values. (think this function is called fromhundreds of places you don't knowwhere these weird values are comingfrom)  An IDE debugger lets youconditionally break execution at anypoint in code based on a conditionnot a line number. An IDE debugger will let you examine the state of the program in the case of an unhandled exception instead of just crapping out. Here's one thing that you definitely cannot debug with ""print"" statement which is when a customer brings you memory dump and says ""your program crashed can you tell me why?"" I think debugging using print statements is a lost art and very important for every developer to learn.  Once you know how to do that certain classes of bugs become much easier to debug that way than through an IDE.  Programmers who know this technique also have a really good feel of what's useful information to put in a log message (not to mention you'll actually end up reading the log) for non-debugging purposes as well. That said you really should know how to use the step-through debugger since for a different class of bugs it is WAY easier.  I'll leave it up to the other excellent answers already posted to explain why :) Off the top of my head: As alternative to debug in IDE you can try great Google Chrome extension ) is .NET only so you might want an older one (like in the first link) if you want native code debugging (it covers both .NET and native).  I personally feel the answer is as simple as ""A integrated debugger/IDE gives you a wealth of different information quickly without the need for punching in commands. The information tends to be there in front of you without you haven't tell it what to show you. The > in which the information can be retrieved is what makes them better than just command-line debugging or ""printf"" debugging. Advantages of a debugger over a printf () Can set watchpoints. This is one of my favourite ways of finding memory corruptions Can debug a binary that you can't recompile at the moment Can debug a binary that takes a long time to recompile Can change variables on the fly Can call functions on the fly  Doesn't have the problem where debug statemenets are not flushed and hence timing issue can not be debugged acuratly Debuggers help with core dumps print statements dont' This is what I use most on VS.NET debugging windows: In summary it gives me a 360 degree view of the state of my executing code not just a small window.  Never found a book teaching this kind of stuff but then again it seems to be quite simple it's pretty much WYSIWYG.  A debugger can attach to a running process Often easier to debug threaded code from a debugger With an IDE debugger you can see the values of ALL the variables in the current scope (all  the way up the call stack) whenever you halt execution.  Print statements can be great but dumping so much information to the screen at any given place can produce a >. You just need to define some actions that print required state in each breakpoint start the console debugger with . A problem with using print statements is it makes a mess of your code. IE you have a function with 10 parts to it and you know it crashes somewhere but you're not sure where. So you add in 10 extra print statements to pinpoint where the bug is. Once you've found and solved your bug you now have to clean up by removing all of those print statements. Maybe you'll do that. Maybe you'll forget and it'll end up in production and your user's console will be full of debug prints. Wauw do I like this question. I never dared to pose it... It seems that people just have different ways of working.For me what works best is: I've earned my living programming for over 40 years now working at non-trivial technical and scientific applications in C++ and Python daily and I have the personal experience that a debugger doesn't help me a bit. I don't say that's good. I don't say that's bad. I just want to share it. It's not just debugging.  An IDE helps you build better software faster in a lot of ways: I could go on."
18,macos - C++ IDE for Macs ,I teach a C++ course using Visual Studio.  One of my students has a Mac and was looking for an IDE to use on his machine. What would be good to recommend? library. It's the one I use. Another (albeit non-free) option is to install VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop on the Mac and run Windows with Visual Studio in a VM. This works really pretty well.  The downsides are: The upside is that you and the student don't need to hassle with differences in the IDE that may not be accounted for in your instruction materials. If you are looking for a full-fledged IDE like Visual StudioI think Eclipse might be your best bet. Eclipse is also highly extensible and configurable. See here:  is free and good which is lucky because it's pretty much the only option on the Mac.
19,Tips for using Vim as a Java IDE? ,"I'm addicted to Vim it's now my de facto way of editing text files. Being that it's mainly a text editor and not an IDE has anyone got tricks for me to make it easier when developing Java apps? Some questions I have: Anything else (other than ""Don't do it!"") that I should know about?Some tips: Have fun :-) I've been a Vim user for years.  I'm starting to find myself starting up Eclipse occasionally (using the vi plugin which I have to say has a variety of issues).  The main reason is that Java builds take quite a while...and they are just getting slower and slower with the addition of highly componentized build-frameworks like maven.  So validating your changes tends to take quite a while which for me seems to often lead to stacking up a bunch of compile issues I have to resolve later and filtering through the commit messages takes a while. When I get too big of a queue of compile issues I fire up Eclipse.  It lets me make cake-work of the changes.  It's slow brutal to use and not nearly as nice of an editor as Vim is (I've been using Vim for nearly a decade so it's second nature to me).  I find for precision editing—needing to fix a specific bug needing to refactor some specific bit of logic or something else...I simply can't be as efficient at editing in Eclipse as I can in Vim. Also a tip: This makes ). I have just uploaded  for the development of Java Maven projects. And don't forget to set the highlighting if you haven't already:  EDIT:  Oh an BTW i've tried eclim off and on but the reason I like vim is its lightness.  Executing eclipse even on headless mode is just too much mental lifting for me. EDIT2:  I've been using playframework lately and this will probably work with maven builds too: For compiling you can configure VIM's make to run maven or in mycase run a build script tee that to a file. ""play_compile"" is just a compile script.  It uses SBT so Maven should work just fine here.  Even direct javac will work.  This way you can use VIM""s quickfix buffer (:cnext :clist: cprev etc). For jumping around the classes I use .  Its beautiful. Use it.  Faster than eclipse in jumping around files. For jumping around methods I use tagsearch with exuberant c-tags. Jump into method declarations by using ctrl-].  Go back    usingCtrl-o.  Doesnt work as good as eclipse but it works good enough. I use  is a nice tool for coding with useful snippets (like in TextMate). You can use (or modify) a pre-made package or make your own."
20,Using Emacs as an IDE ,"Currently my workflow with Emacs when I am coding in C or C++ involves three windows.  The largest on the right contains the file I am working with.  The left is split into two the bottom being a shell which I use to type in compile or make commands and the top is often some sort of documentation or README file that I want to consult while I am working.  Now I know there are some pretty expert Emacs users out there and I am curious what other Emacs functionally is useful if the intention is to use it as a complete IDE.  Specifically most IDEs usually fulfill these functions is some form or another: For a few of these it's pretty obvious how Emacs can fit these functions but what about the rest?  Also if a specific language must be focused on I'd say it should be C++.   One user pointed out that I should have been more specific when I said 'what about the rest'.  Mostly I was curious about efficient version control as well as documentation lookup.  For example in SLIME it is fairly easy to do a quick hyperspec lookup on a Lisp function.  Is there a quick way to look up something in C++ STL documentation (if I forgot the exact syntax of  for example)?You'll have to be specific as to what you mean by ""the rest"".  Except for the object inspector (that I""m aware of) emacs does all the above quite easily: Edit: I realize my answer about documentation lookup really pertained to code navigation.  Here's some more to-the-point info:   Google searching will no doubt reveal further examples. As the second link shows looking up functions (and whatever) in other documentation can be done even if not supported out of the box. I have to recommend .  I'm also working on article about using Emacs as Development Environment for many languages - C/C++ Java Perl Lisp/Scheme Erlang etc... For version control there are several things that you can use depending on what version control system you use. But some of the functionality is common to all of them. It is pretty simple to use no need to customize your init file.You just need to start emacs in daemon mode; This will create an emacs server then you can connect it either from terminal or from gui. I'd also recommend to create some aliases to make it easy to call.  This way emacs will fire up even faster than gedit promise. The one possible problem here if you are running emacs daemon from your casual user you probably can't connect emacs server as  .  For compiling your code it's best to use shell-commands. I am working on this project  very useful.  Truly emacs can be made to do anything. In the recent years Clang became an important part of the Emacs C++ support. Atila Neves had a talk on CppCon 2015:. The other thing it has that I find useful are parsers for location messages so that if you have a call stack trace and want to edit at a particular place in the callstack this front-end interface will can do that.  By far this program could use improvement. But then it could also use people working on it to improve it.  Disclaimer: I work on realgud"

22,java - 'Must Override a Superclass Method' Errors after importing a project into Eclipse ,"Anytime I have to re-import my projects into Eclipse (if I reinstalled Eclipse or changed the location of the projects)  of my overridden methods are not formatted correctly causing the error: The method must override a superclass method It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects - for whatever reason the method argument values are not always populated so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance: will be initially populated like this: The odd thing is if I remove my code and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method it uses the same argument names I already had so I don't really know where the problem is other then it auto-formatting the method for me. This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it .. I would be very happy. Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods which are inside an argument of another method?Eclipse is defaulting to Java 1.5 and you have classes implementing interface methods (which in Java 1.6 can be annotated with . No idea why but this will solve it. This is my second time encounter this problem.first time according the alphazero's recommendation it worked.but in the second time I set to 1.6 it don't work it just like 'CACHE' this error after clean and rebuild. Try to switch off 'Build Automatically' as Rollin_s said -&gt; error still here! So I removed the problem project (already set to 1.6) from Package Explorer and import it again -&gt; it start a rebuild and no error this time Hope this help someone Fixing  must override a super class method error is not difficult You just need to change Java source version to 1.6 because from Java 1.6 @Override annotation can be used along with interface method. In order to change source version to 1.6 follow below steps : In my case this problem happened when I imported a Maven project into Eclipse. To solve this I added the following in : Then in the context menu of the project go to ""Maven -&gt; Update Project ..."" and press OK. That's it. Hope this helps. In my case none the solutions above works. I have to checkout my source code to another folder. From eclipse select File &gt; Switch workSpaces &gt; Other... and then import code to the new workspaces. it works after that.   This happens when your maven project uses different Compiler Compliance level and Eclipse IDE uses different Compiler Compliance level. In order to fix this we need to change the Compiler Compliance level of Maven project to the level IDE uses. 1) To See Java Compiler Compliance level uses in Eclipse IDE  *) Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Compiler Compliance level : 1.8 (or 1.7 1.6  ect)  2) To Change Java Compiler Compliance level of Maven project *) Go to  ""Project"" -&gt;  ""Properties"" -&gt; Select ""Java Compiler"" -&gt; Change the Compiler Compliance level : 1.8 (or 1.7 1.6  ect)  "
23,Can IntelliJ IDEA encapsulate all of the functionality of WebStorm and PHPStorm through plugins? ,"I am in the market for a new IDE but am confused about the overlap between some of Jetbrains' offerings. It looks like IntelliJ IDEA has plugins that allow you to do Node.js and php development.  Can IntelliJ IDEA do everything that WebStorm and PHPStorm do through plugins or do they have special features not available in IDEA? I am hoping to have a single polyglot IDE for all development.All of the functionality of our lightweight IDEs can be found within IntelliJ IDEA (you need to  Definitely a great question.I've noted this also as a sub question of the choice for versions within IDEa that this link may help to address...  it as well potentially possesses a ground work for looking at your other IDE choices and the options they provide. I'm thinking WebStorm is best for JavaScript and Git repo management meaning the HTML5 CSS Cordova kinds of stacks which is really where (I believe along with others) the future lies and energies should be focused now... but ya it depends on your needs etc. Anyway this tells that story too... intellij idea is the best IDE on market. I supports all the fetures of its lightweight IDEs like webStrom pyCham etc. It even works sama as Android Studio.There are only 2 differences1. Creation (""Open Directory"") used in lighter products2. It consumes a lot of memory processor and specially BATTERIES (as its like a super set of all ides)"
24,What Ruby IDE do you prefer? ,I've been using Eclipse with RDT (not RadRails) a lot lately and I'm quite happy with it but I'm wondering if you guys know any decent alternatives. I know NetBeans also supports Ruby these days but I'm not sure what it has to offer over Eclipse. Please list any features you think are brilliant or useful when suggesting an IDE makes it easier to compare. Also I said Ruby not Rails. While Rails support is a plus I prefer things to be none Rails-centric. It should also be available on Linux and optionally Solaris.Have you tried . Once I found Geany (Ubuntu) I switched from TextMate (OSX) and never looked back. Geany is a lean clean speedy IDE that can be used either as a text editor or a light-weight IDE. It supports not only text editing features (syntax highlighting code folding auto-completion auto-closing symbol lists code navigation directory tree multi-tabbed open files etc.) but also normal IDE features such as simple project management compile-build-run within the main window. Unlike TextMate it has a Terminal screen within its own window; you do not have to go back and force between your editor window and terminal window. Unlike TextMate it supports international languages. Unlike TextMate it supports multi-platforms Unlike TextMate it is open-source and free. Geany is now my favorite C/Ruby/XML development tool.   RubyMine is so awesome. Everything just works. I could go on and on. Code completion is fast smooth and accurate. Formatting is instantaneous. Project navigation is easy and without struggle. You can pop open any file with a few keystrokes. You don't even need to keep the project tree open but it's there if you want. You can configure just about any aspect of it to behave exactly how you want. NetBeans Eclipse and RubyMine all have more or less the same set of features. However RubyMine is just so much more cleanly designed and easy to use. There's nothing awkward or clunky about it. There are all these nice little design touches that show how JetBrains really put thought into it instead of just amassing a big pile of features. Incidentally RubyMine can do a lot of the things that Vim can do like select and edit a column of text or split the view into several editing panels with different files in them. 
25,LLVM C++ IDE for Windows ,Is there some C/C++ IDE for Windows which is  (merged from answers):LLVM is supported in  as far as I know. I am the main author of the plug-in so you can ask any questions related to it. The plug-in offers the basic functionality for Clang and llvm-gcc compilation and support Linux and Windows (w/ Cygwin &amp; MiNGW). LLVM tools such as assembler archiver linker and static compiler (llc) are configured and can be customized via UI. The plug-in offers all the benefits that IDE can offer such as easy configuration and building with one action.  The only drawback is that it is not ready yet as it lacks of some of the advanced features that LLVM can offer such as Clang analyze and smart auto-completion. The plug-in is also not tested well and may not work perfectly therefore I hope I can get user feedback via mailing list found from Google code development site (listed below). I wish I had time to develop it further. I only develop it in my spare time which is very limited. I welcome any developers to participate and contribute to the project. Development site: Eclipse marketplace (100% free &amp; open-source):.It can be downloaded s as of 2018 which is crucial for debugging).
26,IDE for JavaScript development ,What do you suggest for JS development IDE. Is there something similar to VisualStudio IDE so I can run/debug my application in it?A few options: At JetBrains we've just developed lightweight  that includes very smart JavaScript Editor with DOM-based autocompletion and HTML5 API support.It allows you to debug(breakpoints supported) and run your scripts directly from IDE. I think IntellJ's JavaScript support is excellent just like everything else that they do.  Standalone or as a Eclipse plugin. The Pro version has some nice addons like the embedded IE (to the always embedded Firefox) and debugging support for both browsers.I found after hours of testing that Suns  is the best PHP and Python IDE for Windows and Linux. I was surprised that also Javascript support can hold the candle to Aptana. So Netbeans is my recommendation (not only for Javascript). Give it a try its free!  I've found  Eclipse and JSEclipse plugin and of course Firefox + Firebug the ultimate duo. You'll find this development setup satisfactory. Aptana is a great IDE as it will provide intelli-sense for CSS javascript html java etc.  The debugger gives you the choice to run in FF or IE and is a full featured debugger.  The community edition allows you to run a server side javascript as well.  A very solid and feature rich platform for free.
27,ide - What is the shortcut to Auto import all in Android Studio? ,"Is there any way of auto importing (like in Eclipse For Windows/Linux you can go to  Go to file Navigate open tabs Look up recent files Go to line Navigate to last edit location Go to declaration Go to implementation Go to source Go to super Class Show Call hierarchy Search in path/project Optimize imports Code Completion Issue quick fix Surround code block Rename and Refractor Line Comment or Uncomment Block Comment or Uncomment Go to previous/next method Show parameters for method Quick documentation lookup Delete a line View declaration in layout (Android Studio --&gt; Preferences --&gt; Editors --&gt; General --&gt; Auto  Import)  On Windows highlight the code that has classes which need to be resolved and hit Go to File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Editor -&gt; Auto Import -&gt; Java and make the  below things: Select Insert imports on paste value to All Do tick mark on Add unambigious imports on the fly option and ""Optimize imports on the fly* For Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) you can go to   the boxes and insert all imports on paste.

28,macos - What's a good IDE for Python on Mac OS X? ,I'm about to start a new job where the coding practices are heavily centered around TDD and refactoring and whose primary development language is Python.  I come from the Java world and have been a confident user of Eclipse for a good long time.  When not working in Java I use emacs. I'm looking for an IDE for Python that will give me a lot of the capabilities I've grown used to with Eclipse not only for refactoring but in terms of code completion project management SCM integration (currently CVS but likely to switch to git one of these days) et al. What IDE should I use?Have tried many different (Kate Eclipse Scite Vim Komodo): each one have some glitches either limited functions or slow and unresponsive. Final choice after many years: Emacs + ropemacs + flymake. Rope project file open dialog is extremely quick. Rope refactoring and code assist functions are super helpful. Flymake shows syntax mistakes. Emacs is the most configurable editor. I am very happy with this config.  Python related part of config is here: public.halogen-dg.com browser/alex-emacs-settings/configs/cfg_python.el My 2 pennies check out PyCharm It's lightweight and offers Code Completion. Costs money. EDIT:Apparently Chocolat was an interesting option in 2013 but since then many others came up and development stalled. Nowadays I recommend Visual Studio Code + Python Plugin.
29,c++ - What does int argc char *argv[] mean? ,In many C++ IDE's and compilers when it generates the main function for you it looks like this: When I code C++ without an IDE just with a command line compiler I type: without any parameters.

32,Eclipse/Java code completion not working ,"I've downloaded unzipped and setup Eclipse 3.4.2 with some plugins (noteable EPIC Clearcase QuantumDB MisterQ).  Now I find when I'm editing Java projects the code completion is not working.  If I type  and press Try  in '' An example of the kind of data you see in this preference screen however not necessarily what you currently have. if have duplicate Mylyn entries uncheck the duplicate entries that do not contain ""  Then in the : as suggested by @nhahtdh's comment adding the some more info to answer directly: IBus plugin in Xfce uses by default I faced this problem and spent hours trying to figure out the issue. tried to follow the steps mentioned in the different answers above the solution I found is on the same lines as Mona suggested but slightly different. Tried to add as a comment to Mona's answer but no option was available.Issue with my eclipse was classpath somehow got corrupted and all the jars and dependent projects were missing. after taking the latest .classpath from repository it worked fine. I had this problem and like @Marc only on a particular class.  I discovered that I needed to designate Open With = Java Editor.  As a Eclipse newbie I hadn't even realized that I was just using a plain editor. In the package explorer right-click the file and chose ""Open With"".  I also face this issue but it is resolved in different way.Steps that I follow may be helpful for others. Once you have you configuration checked and completion is still not working: Do you see the right icon beside the file?: response but the add comment only works after I have a rating of 50? not sure WTF that is... ThanksTom For me the issue was a conflict between several versions of the same library. The Eclipse assist was using an older version than maven.  I had to go to the .m2 directory and delete the unwanted lib version + restart eclipse. I experience problems on Eclipse Neon when . When I copy the same file to the project root directory not even to the src directory the completion starts working. When the file is opened from a different directory only completion for JRE works. That is for example:  does not. Just in case anyone got to a desperate point where nothing works... It happened to us that the content assist somehow shrunk so no suggestion was shown just the ""Press Ctrl+Space for non-Java..."" could be seen.So it was just a matter of dragging the corner of the content assist to enlarge the pop-up. I know embarrassing. Hope it helps. Note: this was an Ubuntu server with Xfce4 using Eclipse Oxygen.  eclipse version so I assume the auto-complete feature does not migrated correctly during the upgrade process. The only solution that worked for me was to create a new eclipse workspace and import the project/s to it. It might take a few minutes but it worth it - comparing to the time spent on other solutions... "
33,Which Android IDE is better - Android Studio or Eclipse? ,I'm starting to develop for Android. Which IDE should I use - Android Studio or Eclipse sdk?I would like to know which one is better.Working with Eclipse can be difficult at times probably when debugging and designing layouts Eclipse sometimes get stuck and we have to restart Eclipse from time to time. Also you get problems with emulators.  Android studio was released very recently and this IDE is not yet heavily used by developers. Therefore it may contain certain bugs.  This describes the difference between android android studio and eclipse project structure:  The use of IDE is your personal preference.But personally if I had to choose Eclipse is a widely known trusted and certainly offers more features then Android Studio.Android Studio is a little new right now. May be it's upcoming versions keep up to Eclipse level soon. Both are equally good. With Android Studio you have ADT tools integrated and with eclipse you need to integrate them manually. With Android Studio it feels like a tool designed from the outset with Android development in mind.Go ahead they have same features. From the Android Studio download page: Caution: Android Studio is currently available as an early access preview. Several features are either incomplete or not yet implemented and you may encounter bugs. If you are not comfortable using an unfinished product you may want to instead download (or continue to use) the ADT Bundle (Eclipse with the ADT Plugin). My first choice is  which I just finished. It shows you exactly how to use all the features of Eclipse that are useful for developing Android apps. There's also a brief section on getting set up to develop from the command line and from other IDEs.

35,debugging - IDE and Debugger for node.js ,I am going to start building project in node.js (was working in PHP before) What is the IDE Debugger and Helping Tools for node.js to help improvement while coding ?There are several IDEs which support Node.js natively: WebStorm 3.0 does all this stuff.It auto completes in a smart way includes nice debugging and unit testing. It also include number of inspection for javascript which is also pleasant.Now RC version is available but JetBrains assure that it'll be released soon.  I use IntelliJ's Webstorm:  for it's advance auto-complete features and Node.js/NodeUnit templates.
36,java.io.Console support in Eclipse IDE ,"I use the Eclipse IDE to develop compile and run my Java projects. Today I'm trying to use the  when an application is run ""through"" Eclipse. Eclipse run the program on a background process rather than a top-level process with the console window we're familiar with. Is there a way to force Eclipse to run the program as a top level process or at least create a Console that the JVM will recognize? Otherwise I'm forced to jar the project up and run on a command-line environment external to Eclipse.I assume you want to be able to use step-through debugging from Eclipse. You can just run the classes externally by setting the built classes in the bin directories on the JRE classpath. You can debug using the remote debugger and taking advantage of the class files built in your project. In this example the Eclipse project structure looks like this:  So all you have to do any time you want to debug the app is: You can track this issue in  offers alternatives to using System.console(). One is to use a BufferedReader wrapped around System.in the second is to use a Scanner wrapped around System.in.  Neither are as concise as console but both work in eclipse without having to resort to debug silliness! Let's say your Eclipse workspace is C:\MyWorkspace you created your java application inside a maven project MyProject and your Java main class is com.mydomain.mypackage.MyClass. In this case you can run your main class that uses  on the command line: NB1: if it's not in a maven project check the output folder in project properties | Java Build Path | Source. It might not be ""target/classes"" NB2: if it is a maven project but your class is in src/test/java you'll likely have to use ""target\test-classes"" instead of ""target\classes"""
37,Changing API level Android Studio ,"I want to change the minimum SDK version in Android Studio from API 12 to API 14. I have tried changing it in the manifest file i.e. and rebuilding the project but I still get the Android Studio IDE throwing up some errors. I presume I have to set the min SDK in 'project properties' or something similar so the IDE recognizes the change but I can't find where this is done in Android Studio.When you want to update your minSdkVersion in an existent project... An example of build.gradle: For beginners in Android Studio ""Sync gradle button"" is located in  Tools -&gt; Android -&gt; Sync Project with Gradle Files ""Rebuild project""  Build -&gt; Rebuild Project  Though this question was already answered but Android Studio has changed a little bit by its stable release. So an easy straight forward way will help any new answer seeker landing here.

In Android studio open build.gradle and edit the following section: here you can change minSdkVersion from 12 to 14 Changing the minSdkVersion in the manifest is not necessary. If you change it in the gradle build file as seen below you accomplish what you need to do.  For me what worked was: (right click)project-&gt;android tools-&gt;clear lint markers. Although for some reason the Manifest reverted to the old (lower) minimum API level but after I changed it back to the new (higher) API level there was no red error underline and the project now uses the new minimum API level. Edit: Sorry I see you were using Android Studio not Eclipse. But I guess there is a similar 'clear lint markers' in Studio somewhere and it might solve the problem.

38,What is the best IDE for C Development / Why use Emacs over an IDE? ,"so as per one of my previous questions I'm brushing up on my C skills.  Thanks for posting links which answer some of my questions but I guess what I'm really wondering about is: Whether learning to edit using emacs / vim and compiling / debugging using the gcc-toolchain is worth it instead of just using an IDE and why? What are peoples reasons for not migrating to an IDE? Has anyone moved from terminal-centric development to IDE development and why did they move?I started off by using IDEs Microsoft or not. Then while working on QNX some long time ago I was forced to do with a text editor + compiler/linker. Now I prefer this simple combination––a syntax highlighting editor + C compiler and linker cli + make––to any IDEs even if environment allows for them. The reasons are for me: it's everywhere. If you program in C you do have the compiler and usually you can get yourself an editor. The first thing I do––I get myself nedit on Linux or Notepad++ on Windows. I would go with vi but GUI editors provide for a better fonts and that is important when you look at code all day you can program remotely via ssh when you need to. And it does help a lot sometimes to be able to ssh into the target and do some quick things there it keeps me close to CLI preferably UNIX/Linux CLI. So all the commands are on my fingertips and when I need them I don't have to go read a reference book. And UNIX CLI can do things IDEs often can't––because their developers didn't think you'd need them most importantly it is very much like seeing the Matrix in raw code. I operate files so I'm forced to keep them manageable. I'm finding things in my code manually which makes me keep it simple and organized. I do Config Management explicitly so I know when I'm synced and how. I know my Makefiles because I write them and they only do what I tell them to (if you wonder if that works in ""really big projects""––it does work and the bigger the project the more performance it gains me) when people ask me to look at their code I don't have to learn the IDE they use I've moved from a terminal text-editor+make environment to Eclipse for most of my projects. Spanning from C and C++ to Java and Python to name few languages I am currently working with. The reason was simply productivity. I could not afford spending time and effort on keeping all projects ""in my head"" as other things got more important.  There are benefits of using the ""hardcore"" approach (terminal) - such as that you have a much thinner layer between yourself and the code which allows you to be a bit more productive when you're all ""inside"" the project and everything is on the top of your head. But I don't think it is possible to defend that way of working just for it's own sake when your mind is needed elsewhere. Usually when you work with command line tools you will frequently have to solve a lot of boilerplate problems that will keep you from being productive. You will need to know the tools in detail to fully leverage their potentials. Also maintaining a project will take a lot more effort. Refactoring will lead to updates in make-files etc. To summarize: If you only work on one or two projects preferably full-time without too much distractions ""terminal based coding"" can be more productive than a full blown IDE. However if you need to spend your thinking energy on something more important an IDE is definitely the way to go in order to keep productivity. Make your choice accordingly. Emacs >. I have used Eclipse with the CDT plug in quite successfully. Emacs would be better if it had a text editor in it... :-) Use . Crossplatform as it is 100% pure Java. Not the fastest IDE on earth but for Java actually very fast very flexible not that nice looking though. Both have very sophisticated code folding syntax highlighting (for all languages you can think of!) and are very flexible regarding configuring it for you personal needs. jEdit is BTW very easy to extend to add whatever feature you may need there (it has an ultra simple scripting language that looks like Java but is actually ""scripted""). If you're on Windows then it's a total no-brainer: Get Visual C++ Express."
39,java - IDE for Swing ,Is there any IDE that simplifies creating Swing applications (ideally something along the lines of Visual Studio)Like others have mentioned NetBeans' visual editor is pretty good but it's based pretty heavily on the  plugin: which is also based on Eclipse simply adding a few plugins to it as many other commercial products do. It is still not able to parse any Swing code (I doubt any Swing WISIWYG editor does) but if you start with it it gives you relatively seamless experience.You need to pay for it though. At the end of the day I have worked with different similar UI tools Flash Builder Delphi etc. but unless you do some relatively trivial UI design not including much business logic and communication with other layers you'll have to accept that what you are capable of creating in code once you learn to do it properly is much more powerful than what any editor is capable of providing you with. I have switched between several IDEs and the one that I believe has the best GUI builder in terms of use and performance would have to be NetBeans. I have tried a few and the closest I have found that comes close to Visual Studio is NetBeans. Version 6.5 is excellent and really improved over version 5. I'm a big fan of JetBrains and when it comes to Java  Use NetBeans I have also successfully developed one application using NetBeans. It is realy awesome it helps you while writing the code.Since Swing generates some code on its own so it is really helpful to use Netbeans.Go through it and you can always ask question and problems.It will be good if you go for latest version release. I have always coded my UIs by hand. The frustration of dealing with screen builders and filling out all those property sheets is too much for me. After a couple of screens and a little research I am just as productive. As I'm using Eclipse I use the Visual Editor plugin. It generates clean source code with good patterns and easy to patch/modify/extend.Unfortunately it is not very stable. But it's worth trying. I like Eclipse's VisualEditor (VE) and sometime ago I've tried to switch toanother editor but I found it impossible. Visual editor has thisfeature that it generates manageable readable editable and easy-to-understand code. Unlike both mentioned earlier NetBeans editor and WindowBuilder it uses the lazy initialization pattern to separate initialization of components. Also it does not need to lock down parts of code that you can't edit; you may edit code by hand and VE is still able to work with your changes. The only disadvantage of VE is that it uses  is good option and it is free also. As others have mentioned my best experience with Java SWING applications is with NetBeans. NetBeans has a WYSIWYG editor and the code is automatically generated for you which is then protected however you can add custom code to add listeners and other events that the end user may be interested in using such as buttons text forms and areas and other nice GUI tools.
40,Best C++ IDE or Editor for Windows ,"What is the best C++ IDE or editor for using on Windows? I use Notepad++ but am missing IntelliSense from Visual Studio.I've found the latest release of NetBeans which includes C/C++ support to be excellent.  a powerful open-source cross platform IDE. It has code completion amongst other features. I will quote myself from this question: Someone already said this before me  but QtCreator is really good for Qt4  development. Not only it has a really good code  completion support. It also knows a  little more about the code and what to  complete then I thought I needed. For  example it knows about slots/signals.  This means that connecting  slots/signals via code is much easier  then before. The code editing is really nice. I  remember that when refactoring code  (a few variables starting with  underscore) it remembered the cursor  position between lines and this made  the refactoring much easier. The code  indentation is smart enough to not get  in my way (KDevelop was configurable  but QtCreator learns how I code. At  least it feels like it does). Then there are the cool key  combinations. Most of the  functionality of the IDE can be  accessed using shortcuts. The  ""control+k"" thingie is a nice thing  which some command line users would  like but I am more GUI oriented. I  don't use it. What I really like is the split  window command. Yes KDevelop3 does  it but not as nice as QtCreator. My  favorite is control+e3 which I use to  display the header and implementations  of my classes. Once again the  navigation here is the best I have  seen (control+eo). It also has a nice SCM integration. I  usually use SVN and quite frankly  it's not as good as I need: no  shortcut to diff the project no diff  to commit the whole project no option  to commit several files. I also don't like the ""total  integration of external tools"". I  still like the external QtAssistant -  control+tab is easier to read large  articles. But.... when you define a  QString s and 3 lines bellow you want  to read the interface of QString you  put your cursor on ""s"" and press F1 -  the assistant comes as a sidebar with  QString's documentation. A huge  advantage. Want to follow a definition? F2 to the  help. F4? Changes  header/implementation (yes eclipse  does this better...). The debugger is good. It's not as good  as VisualStudio but ... it has support  for Qt4 internals (you can see the  value of QString and QList!). I can continue... but IMHO you will  need to give it a second and third  try. It really is a good product. Not  as flexible as Eclipse (hi  ryansstack) but it's a really small  fast and young project. I stopped  developing QDevelop because I really  found what I was looking for. ps: yes I mean stopped developing  QDevelop. I was in the development  team. My response is for Qt4 development only. Be warned. SlickEdit is very cool and does support something like intellisense. At my current company I now use Visual Studio and I've mostly gotten used to it - but there are still some SlickEdit features I miss.  As a complete all-in one package Visual Studio 2008 is the best IDE for C++ development with Windows Visual studio is great but there are few tricks you can enhance it with. SonicFileFinder is one - helps you to search source files by partial match. You can map solution-tree to Alt+1 partial filename search to alt+2 and properties-window to alt+3. These are the three most used windows.  Another great tool that is ofter misunderstood is ctrl+shift+F shortcut for searching file contents. People dont use because it's so slow but my advice is - deal with it. Searching  the whole solution (or even all files in project folder) is only slow the first time you use it. Consequitive searches are as fast as jump-to-definition-feature. I've tried SlickEdit Notepad++ emacs jEdit and Visual Studio. VS wins hands-down for Best Windows IDE.  jEdit is probably the best GUI cross-platform editor/almost-IDE and emacs is probably the best terminal cross-platform editor/almost-IDE. The advantage with using these is that when you jump to a Mac or Linux box you know how they work.  I tried Eclipse but it ran like a no-legged dog it was so slow so I didn't use it much. Maybe tech is better now but eh. With Intellisense code folding edit and continue and a whole host of other features Visual Studio is certainly the best IDE.  However for simple code editing I often use UltraEdit.  It has some great features not found in Visual Studio.  One surprisingly useful feature is being able to select a column in the editor.  You can find and replace within the column (useful for tabs vs. spaces wars...) delete the column etc... How about CodeBlocks i find it so fine with me especially the new 10.05 version. I would recommend . Here's another vote for Visual Studio.  The debugger and Intellisense are definitely it's hallmarks.  While other IDE's offer code-completion I've often found them to be somewhat sluggish in this area for some reason (sluggish being a reference to the speed at which code-completion occurs and offers selections).   Other than VS NetBeans is a good polished IDE and is updated on a very regular cycle. I think it's largely a matter of taste but I would recommend begginers to stick to a pure editor (vi emacs...) instead of a full fledged IDE so they can figure out the whole toolchain that modern IDEs hide. Just for the record my weapon of choice is Emacs. personally i dont like microsoft......I hate to admit that visual studio is the best IDE i ever use.....Netbeans is gud but drasticaly slow....other free IDEs are useless..so people try to stick with VS.... M$ VS2008 is a better IDE for this. The question says specifically IDE so I am guessing thats what you want. In that case the main options are Visual Studio and Eclipse CDT as stated above. Of those I personally prefer Eclipse. However don't necessarily limit yourself to an IDE. I prefer to use vim as my editor and WinDbg as my debugger. For compilation your project will probably dictate this. I currently use NMAke on the command line. Use Visual Studio 2010. You can get the full version free with "
41,emacs - Best Common Lisp IDE ,I've used Slime within Emacs as my primary development environment for Common Lisp (or Aquamacs on OS X) but are there other compelling choices out there? I've heard about Lispworks but is that [or something else] worth looking at? Or does anyone have tips to getting the most out of Emacs (e.g. hooking it up to the hyperspec for easy reference)?

42,Difference between framework vs Library vs IDE vs API vs SDK vs Toolkits? ,I want some examples. I always get confused so with some examples I might be able to figure it out better. Also: Is Eclipse an API or IDE?An : While not the prevalent notion a framework can be viewed as a kit. It also has a library (or a collection of libraries that work together) that provides a specific coding structure &amp; pattern (thus the word >). (e.g. Spring Framework) Consider Android Development: IDE: Eclipse etc.. Library: android.app.Activity library (Class with all code) API: Interface basically all functions with witch we call  SDK: The Android SDK provides you the API libraries and developer tools necessary to build test and debug apps for Android(----tools - DDMSEmulator ----platforms - Android OS versions ----platform tools - ADB ----API docs) ToolKit: Could be ADT Bundle Framework: Big library but more of architecture oriented SDK represents to software development kit and IDE represents to integrated development environment.  The IDE is the software or the program is used to write compile run and debug such as Xcode.  The SDK is the underlying engine of the IDE includes all the platform's libraries an app needs to access. It's more basic than an IDE because it doesn't usually have graphical tools. In other words... Even your notepad is an IDE. Every software you write/compile code with is an IDE.   A bunch of code which simplifies functions/methods for quick use. A programming interface for functions/configuration which you work with its usage is often documented. Extras and/or for development/testing purposes.  Tiny apps for quick use often GUIs.  Apps with a graphical interface requires no knowledge of programming unlike APIs. Bunch of APIs/huge Library/Snippets wrapped in a namespace/or encapsulated from outer scope for compact handling without conflicts with other code. A design pattern separated in Models Views and Controllers for huge applications. They are not dependent on each other and can be changed/improved/replaced without to take care of other code. The object that is being  presented.  Example in IT: A HTML form.  Example in IT: Browser that renders a website with the form.  Example in IT: Functions which handle form data that's being submitted.Small codes of only a few lines may not be even complete but worth for a quick share. Exclusive functions for specified frameworks/APIs/libraries only. Additional modules or services for specific GUIs.
43,Query IDE for MongoDB? ,"I'm wondering if there is an IDE for MongoDB that allows you to run queries and see the results? This would behave like query analyzer in SQL Server Management Studio. The issue I'm having right now is that I have to do queries such as ""db.MyTable.find()"" from command prompt which isn't a good solution.  If the answer is no is there a more mature ""no sql"" solution like MongoDB that does have an IDE? By far the best UI (for Windows) currently out there  is MongoVUE. Robo 3T (formerly Robomongo) give you a shell like interface but outputs your results in the gui.Its available for windows mac(dmg zip) and linux (deb rpm tar.gz) as a desktop application. Currently there is a free community version (no ads all features) and payed ones with more support and influence on backlog.

45,Best Fortran IDE ,"Is there anybody using Fortran on stackoverflow? What IDE do you use and which one do you think to be the best? Seems lots of people surround me are quite inconvenient with Intel Visual Fortran. Because there is no support for intellisense refactoring etc.Well as others already mentioned you could use instead of an IDE a separate text editor. Several come to mind;   VIM (or one of the family) - great editing capabilities very customizable. Unfortunatelly it is still an editor not an IDE. It can be customized in a variety of ways of course but that gets boring after a while.  Also it's syntax highlighting capabilities are somewhat wrongly made. Also has some problems/confusions with free/fixed format and f77/f90/f95 ...   Emacs - pretty much same advantages/shortcomings as the above.   In general editors like the above mentioned can be used but in that case it is best to choose one from the start and stick to it; modifying your work habits as you go; since customizing everything can be time consuming to suit your needs. Most editors have problems with fortran's syntax since they're used to C's (where everything that ""opens"" has a ""close""). As far as IDE's goes your options are not that great:   > What about these ones: . I do not like Code::Blocks... We use an in-house extension to visual studio to get code completion for our fortran code and to assist us with debugging. But even so there is a lot of room for improvement. Our main issues are:  We used Sun workshop and it was very good but there is no windows version. jedit has a nice fortran mode and you can define keybindings for the compiler and debugger.for small to medium sized projects it is quite nice. it also has svn and multiple files search. also very nice is hypersearch where you get a list of you matches and you can go to the position with a single click. another goodie is a plugin for gdb and for ctags. you can very easily script all functions using jython. it feels a little bit like a modern version of emacs that uses python instead of lisp. check out the plugin manager. it lets you download all the plugins from the server and installs them for you (like in eclipse).

47,What's a good IDE for Erlang programming? ,"As far as I know there's Erlang plugin for NetBeans and Eclipse. Which one has the upper hand at the moment?  Are there any other IDE for Erlang which I didnt mention and how good are they when compare with NetBeans and Eclipse? The best IDE for Erlang is Emacs. However the mode which ships with Erlang isn't the best. ). Pros:Syntax highlight autocompletion and suggestion all work well.During suggest it will display some documentationif available: very useful when exploring a module. Error and warning annotiations are quick and helpful. All things considered the user experience is good especially if you are used to eclipse. Cons:Erlide can also run your modules but I find the shell is too clunky to be usable. I always keep a ""real"" erlang shell open and compile/test my code from there. There is also a Textmate bundle (google) but I have not tried that yet. Erlang mode in Emacs is the generally recommended IDE.  and Vimthey are good enough for developing.Geany can also compile and run the code. . I'm using sublime text on windows mac and linux Emacs or VIM is not a good choice if you didn't have experience on them.There a too many bugs in Eclipse...And IntelliJ IDEA is the best IDE"
48,Inefficient jQuery usage warnings in PHPStorm IDE ,I recently upgraded my version of PHPStorm IDE and it now warns me about inefficient jQuery usage. For example: Prompts this warning: Checks that jQuery selectors are used in an efficient way. It suggests  to split descendant selectors which are prefaced with ID selector and  warns about duplicated selectors which could be cached. So my question is: Why is this inefficient and what is the efficient way to do the above selector? I'd guess at: Is this the right way?I had the same question today and was able to find a solution thanks to  There was some discussion about this on jQuery forums but its 3 years old:As they point out here if you are doing a lot of operations on same id selector the greatest performance improvement is found by caching the top level element.On the other hand if you are doing just a few selections there is going to be virtually no performance difference. Therefor I believe that IntelliJ is overstating the importance of this code style.  The first question is to hit Alt+Enter and select the first tip in the list then hit Enter you'll see what it thinks the most efficient way.
49,Which IDE for Scala 2.8? ," is the same question for older version of Scala but they say that Eclipse plugin has been improved vastly. Is it the best IDE now? How do different Scala IDE compare today? I've been pretty successful with IDEA 9. I've briefly tried both Netbeans and Eclipse and wasn't able to get what I wanted. Eclipse's code-complete didn't behave as well as I'd have liked and I couldn't find a way to make Netbeans handle Scala scripts; It'd just complain that the file wasn't a class. To be clear I've been using IDEA for a few years for Java so keep that in mind:) For the moment Scala Plugin in IntelliJ IDEA is the best. It handles Scala 2.8 well. IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition is now free and open source (and works with Scala) so I can't see any reason for not using it. The plugin is still somewhat buggy (many ""false negatives"" i.e. the code without red underscores may not compile successfully; but almost no ""false positives"") but perfectly usable. The best thing is that you can use IDEA's excellent debugger with Scala (not without some issues but it actually works!). FSC (Fast Scala Compiler) is also supported in latest builds. A huge time-saver. The plugin development team is quite responsive. Some of the guys work directly in JetBrains and possess intimate knowledge about IDEA platform so the development progresses fast. JetBrains IDEA's Scala plug-in handles 2.7 and 2.8 equally well. I cannot make any comparisons because I have used only IDEA. Using Eclipse Helios with the dev-version of the new Scala(2.8) plugin as there isn't an official release yet. That > beta definitively -- but I can't confirm the frequently expressed opinion that this plugin is outright horrible ;-) I'd say the experience is already OK-ish and indeed better than the current state of affairs with the Groovy plugin. OTOH the experience with plain Java is way more smooth (feels like flying at times) and the current CDT I'd rate somewhat in between. Incremental compile and error highlighting work quite well for me; tweaking a DSL implementation into form just by continuously rewriting your code until the error markers are gone -- without ever having to test-run your program -- is outright fun and just again shows that FP / static typing rocks! Problems encountered from time to time:- implicits and nested types in other compilation units (esp. nested / super packages) aren't picked up at times when there are still other errors around; they will be picked up after an full build- there seems to be a memory leak in the version I'm using right now (from end august 2010) necessitating to restart the workbench after some hours of work- beware when you're using AspectJ to make sure you get a version of the Scala plugin which relies on a JDT weaving bundle version which also works with AJDT PS: I'm using maven builds in all my projects and generated the eclipse projects with the eclipse-maven-plugin and then imported them as plain-flat eclipse projects. I can just strongly recommend everyone to keep away from the M2-eclipse plugin (for maven) in its current (2010) state it makes your workbench painfully slow is buggy and has lots of almost unpredictable behaviour because it constantly tries to do magic things behind the scenes (and besides that the aspectj support is broken since this spring) i use both eclipse and IDEA eclipse supports type detection isbetter than IDEA (it is veryneccessery thing if you want programin functional style that you can beaware from type of expressions andvariables.) : IDEA supports type detection like eclipse but you haveto define a value in your functionsfor example: deftestTs[A](a:List[String]b:List[A])= for{      ai &lt;- a      bi &lt;- b    }  yield (aibi)   }deftestTs[A](a:List[String]b:List[A]):List[(StringA)]={    val result = for{      ai &lt;- a      bi &lt;- b    }  yield (aibi)   }I think that the best option so far is the ScalaIDE for Eclipse. You can go to the ScalaIDE Web Site and look around to see by yourself.  to get an idea. For everyone who is really considering doing some serious development with Scala I strongly recommend to evaluate the IDEs in question beyond the basics. When you are into an agile approach which in my option requires a painless refactoring support without surprises (especially in multi-module projects) things are pretty tight at the moment. It would be pretty neat if someone came up with a IDE independent specification-like list of refactorings (and desired outcomes) which could be used to verify an IDE's refactoring support. The officially endorsed and supported (by Typesafe) for Scala 2.9 is Eclipse. The current version is far superior to prior versions and includes a context-aware REPL full-featured debugger and even the ability to debug REPL statements.  I think this question needs to be updated and the answers revisited. I don't recommend the Scala IDE/Eclipse.  It doesn't have a lot of the features that are even available for Eclipse with Java.  And there are bugs. I am using the latest NetBeans and haven't tried anything else. I've met at least 2 notable bugs in NetBeans while coding in Scala: One: NB occasionally come unable to run a program hanging on classpath scanning.Solution: Create a new project copy your code there and go on.Comment:  of particular namespaces or classes and complains when you use them.Solution: Just ignore and go on - compiler founds no errors and the program works. I'd recommend IDEA's plugin for now. The Scala plugin for NetBeans is quite nice too. It doesn't yet support NetBeans 6.9 the newest release though and you still need to download it manually instead of installing it directly from the plugin manager inside NetBeans.  However it integrates better with Maven projects than IDEA's plugin does (this is true for NB and IDEA in general in my opinion). It partly depends on your style of working as all the options have strengths and weaknesses. If you need refactoring across mixed java/scala projects then IntelliJ is your only option. If you want to do any work on the compiler or a compiler plugin then Eclipse has the advantage of being able to launch a runtime workspace with a custom compiler build including breakpoints.  It also improved massively for the 2.8 Scala release. Netbeans is a fine choice to go with if you're already very familiar with that platform the costs of learning a new environment may well outweigh any benefits and all three solutions are improving rapidly. I haven't tried netbeans scala plugin yet but I find that Intellij IDEA plugin is at any way much better a scala ide than the Scala eclipse plugin which is sooooo slow that drives me crazy.Though swing applications don't work well with my tiling window manager. try IDEAX the latest community edition of Intellij IDEA (version 10) it has improved scala plugin which has faster code compilation and exceution in addition to that it has Maven3 and SBT support with which we can develop Lift applications. IntelliJ IDEA community edition + Scala Plugin + SBT plugin"
50,What IDE is the Delphi IDE developed in? ,Out of curiosity does anyone know which IDE the developers of the Delphi IDE are using?In Delphi (probably the previous version). The compiler itself is written in C but the IDE is written in Delphi. Through the  you can actually access the various objects like TActions that exist in the IDE.
51,testing - Online IDE for Python ,Is there any web-based IDE that I can use to run quick tests? There're a dozen for PHP and some for even Java but I haven't found yet that runs Python. If there's an  that'd be better. ThanksYou might want to give a try at: These aren't full IDEs but there are a lot of options for online python interpreters: I'm trying out  is good too. I'm pretty sure that IDE's are the last kind of programs that will ever go web based because a good IDE needs to be so extremely interactive if it wants to be good. I really don't see a reason for this and others seem to agree because there isn't any.And no an interactive web shell or compiler has nothing to do with an IDE.  
52,Choosing an IDE/Editor for Clojure coding ,"I'm looking for an editor or an IDE for my Clojure coding and I found this thread: However I have a couple of questions:Which IDE offers the best Clojure environment (right now): IntelliJ Eclipse or NetBeans?What are the advantages of Aquamacs (I read Rick is using it) over the previous heavy-weight IDEs?I have spent significant chunks of time (on a Mac) with: My opinions on those: > - The Eclipse editor is coming along and the structural editing has some of the niceties of paredit (but not the truly essential slurp barf splice capability).  The Eclipse repl is just a stock command-line repl and is pretty bad in comparison to NetBeans.  However the NetBeans remote repl has been broken out into an independent project and is coming very soon to Eclipse which will make Eclipse even more attractive.  Maven integration is very good.  I use Eclipse now when I want to see lots of files and projects at once which I have a hard time doing in Emacs. At the moment my bet is that the Eclipse tooling will start to pull away from the others.  But I'm still hoping for a Clojure-specific IDE to show up. :)      The world has changed a lot since I first wrote this. There are now at least 6 very good Clojure environments. If you have not allegiance to a pre-existing editor and want an easy place to start there are two great choices: 1)  There you can see most of the keyboard shortcuts. Sublime Text with Paredit and SublimeREPL is a quite a good option. Sublime Text is a powerful and light weight editor. It enjoys a big umbrella of plugins. Agree with Alex. I have tried NetBeansEmacs Textmate and Eclipse on OSX. For now Eclipse is a better choice. BTW it also depends on your background. If you are a Java programmer Eclipse is a very good choice. Sometimes I use the REPL - for example to try out Clojure 1.3 Alpha3.We do need a Clojure-specific IDE; something like Komodo. There is a new Clojure plugin for Intellij called .   Unfortunately it looks like . Make sure you can get emacs.app for mac.  According to the writer:""The reason I recommend Emacs is that it offers tight integration with a Clojure REPL which allows you to instantly try out your code as you write. That kind of tight feedback loop will be useful while learning Clojure and later when writing real Clojure programs. Emacs is also great for working with any Lisp dialect; in fact Emacs is written in a Lisp dialect called Emacs Lisp (elisp).""."
53,Scheme IDE for Windows ,What is a good Scheme IDE for Windows? OK I'll admit it; I'm not at RMS's level and don't want to use Emacs or any character-based interface -- I want a graphic IDE with colorization a REPL and usable in-line help for a specific well-documented dialect of Scheme. I have searched around and PLT Scheme/DrScheme seems the best but even that does not look too sophisticated. is an excellenet product well worth taking a look at. It's got all the features you're asking for I think what you want actually is Emacs. Let's see: I've been playing with Xacc.Ide and Iron Scheme and found they were pretty good although they felt not finished in some places. They're good enough for trying out scheme I'm not sure if I'd use them for writing commercial software though. I've seen the author of both of them hang around here so maybe he can tell more.. As far as I know (I used DrScheme for a few months before switching to Emacs) DrScheme has many IDE-like features but they are presented in a simplified interface because of its educational focus. Do some digging and I think you'll be happy what you find. Also I can't resist since I > use Emacs---an OS specific install of emacs is hardly ever character based. I just found out the scheme plugin for eclipse I haven't try it yet.It looks pretty nice.and its git repository I personally use ChezScheme. I run scheme scripts from the console and edit them in eclipse using the SchemeWay plugin. Eclipse is superior to Emacs in my opinion and it has some nice features like automatic indentation and autocomplete for defined names.
54,php - PHPDoc type hinting for array of objects? ,"So in PHPDoc one can specify  doesn't seem to be valid for example. The best you can do is say I do that a lot in Zend Studio. Don't know about other editors but it ought to work. In the PhpStorm IDE from JetBrains you can use  is not necessary. . I prefer to read and write clean code - as outlined in ""Clean Code"" by Robert C. Martin.When following his credo you should not require the developer (as user of your API) to know the (internal) structure of your array.  The API user may ask: Is that an array with one dimension only? Are the objects spread around on all levels of a multi dimensional array? How many nested loops (foreach etc.) do i need to access all objects? What type of objects are ""stored"" in that array? As you outlined you want to use that array (which contains objects) as a one dimensional array.  As outlined by Nishi you can use: for that.  But again: be aware - this is not a standard docblock notation. This notation was introduced by some IDE producers.  Okay okay as a developer you know that ""[]"" is tied to an array in PHP. But what do a ""something[]"" mean in normal PHP context? ""[]"" means: create new element within ""something"". The new element could be everything. But what you want to express is: array of objects with the same type and it´s exact type. As you can see the IDE producer introduces a new context. A new context you had to learn. A new context other PHP developers had to learn (to understand your docblocks). Bad style (!). Because your array do have one dimension you maybe want to call that ""array of objects"" a ""list"". Be aware that ""list"" has a very special meaning in other programming languages. It would be mutch better to call it ""collection"" for example. Remember: you use a programming language that enables you all options of OOP.Use a class instead of an array and make your class traversable like an array. E.g.: Or if you want to store the internal objects on different levels within an multi dimensional array/object structure: This solution replaces your array by an object of type ""orderCollection"" but do not enable code completion within your IDE so far. Okay. Next step: Implement the methods that are introduced by the interface with docblocks - particular:  Do not forget to use type hinting for: This solution stops introducing a lot of: all over your code files (e.g. within loops) as Zahymaka confirmed with her/his answer. Your API user is not forced to introduce that docblocks to have code completion. To have @return on only one place reduces the redundancy (@var) as mutch as possible. Sprinkle ""docBlocks with @var"" would make your code worst readable. Finaly you are done. Looks hard to achive? Looks like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Not realy since you are familiar with that interfaces and with clean code. Remember: your source code is written once / read many. If code completion of your IDE do not work with this approach switch to a better one (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA PhpStorm Netbeans) or file a feature request on the issue tracker of your IDE producer. Thanks to Christian Weiss (from Germany) for being my trainer and for teaching me such a great stuff. PS: Meet me and him on XING.  Now usage of classes: Once again: I suspect not all IDE support it but PhpStorm does. Try yours post in comment the results! I know I'm late to the party but I've been working on this problem recently.  I hope someone sees this because the accepted answer although correct is > the best way you can do this.  Not in PHPStorm at least I haven't tested NetBeans though. The best way involves extending the ArrayIterator class rather than using native array types.  This allows you to type hint at a class-level rather than at an instance-level meaning you only have to PHPDoc once not throughout your code (which is not only messy and violates DRY but can also be problematic when it comes to refactoring - PHPStorm has a habit of missing PHPDoc when refactoring) See code below: The key here is the PHPDoc  to signify ""an array of Foo's"" but it's not supported by IDE's. I've found something which is working it can save lives !"
55,Does Google Chrome work with Selenium IDE (as Firefox does)? ,I can't find an equivalent of Selenium IDE that works with Chrome. Does anyone know the way to use Selenium IDE works with Chrome instead of Firefox? Or is there any alternative tool which can work with Chrome?artejera do you mean Selenium as plugin to your browser (Selenium IDE)?Here is . Katalon Studio is a free Selenium IDE alternative. Our team has used it before and it has some advantages over Selenium IDE: Whatever tool you choose there are some criteria you should pay attention to: you can use Google chrome extensions like imacros scirocco on chrome 21 or later versions. they are similar to selenium IDE for Firefox. Scirocco seems to be new with some limitations like navigation is not supported. So I recommend 'imacros' seems very close to selenium. If you want to harness Selenium IDE record &amp; playback capabilities for Chrome browser there is an equivalent extension for Chrome called Scirocco.You can add it to Chrome by visiting here using your Chrome browser 
56,clang-based cross-platform C++ IDE? ,The  C++ compiler claims to be built for among other things better IDE integration by providing an API for the IDE to use for tasks such as parsing the code. So are there are any good C++ IDE's that use clang to provide features such as semantic highlighting refactoring and finding and showing semantic errors in real-time? I've been using Eclipse CDT but its C++ parser is full of imperfections that cause the IDE to report a lot of annoying false positive errors in the code. I would like to have an IDE that reports an error if and only if the compiler would report the same error hence my interest in an IDE that's built on a compiler's internals. I'm primarily interested in cross-platform IDE's although I wouldn't mind knowing about single-platform ones for Windows or Linux (so  Xcode).Qt Creator is basing their next-gen code parsing and associated functionality on Clang:  Clearly advertises libclang backend as a main feature.
57,Professional VHDL IDE? ,Is there a good IDE to work with VHDL projects ?Or are most of the professionals working with emacs/vim/notepad++ ?I use Emacs+VHDL-mode which is great if you don't mind (or have already climbed) the learning curve of Emacs. Alternatively you could try  for simulation. But I am no professional so I suppose they are using some of the former two products. Engineers in large semiconductor companies are using emacs/vim for code editing. Integrated Development Environment doesn't make much sense there since a > is a few thousand HDL files taken from different places on a *NIX network setup scripts for a dozen different tools and cron jobs to do frequent builds. For simpler FPGA projects developed on Windows I've seen people using Borland CodeWright UltraEdit and Crimson Editor.     My best bet is to use VIM to do whatever i need to for VHDL formatting. VIM has an extremely powerful facility to develop custom plugins and no amount of IDE hopping will give you all the customization you would ever need.  Things like signal names &lt; 20 characters procedure lengths &lt; 100 lines no use of linkage ports -- all of these can be coded in VIM with minimal effort. You could actually run vcom or ncvhdl from within VIM and then see where the errors are.  Having said all this you might want to take a look at what Sigasi has to offer. If you need more help on this let me know -- it'd be fun coding a VIM plugin.  Emacs + VHDL mode + a compiler / simulator + source control. The VHDL mode is configured to use the compiler to compile the design and optionally run the simulation. Emacs can link with the source control to correctly check in diff and tag. I personally like this set up because the editor is open source and I can use it anywhere (Mac Linux Windows). The compiler / simulator can be anything from a free download (FPGA vendor sponsored Modelsim or GHDL) to a grid engine. Once set up it pretty much becomes invisible. Simplifide also has an eclipse plugin which supports VHDL Verilog and SystemVerilog which contains all of the standard IDE features and more.  It can be downloaded at . It's a plugin I'm working on that provides syntax checking based on simulators/compilers. I'm using daily with ModelSim and so far works nice. Emacs with the appropriate language mode is my vote. Basic editing is easy enough to learn and there are a lot of example config files out there.Kevin. I'm using Xilinx ISE for educational purposes it works really well. And it has everything. After applying for a student license the student version it free to use but it takes up a lot of space. The installation file alone is more than 6 gb. The book we use for school is referring to xilinx special properties. (“FGPA Prototyping by VHDL Examples”). I'm also programming on a nexsys 3 spartan 6 testboard and I'll be using xilinx for another year but when I finish the course I’m gonna look for something smaller. Happy to read about the lightweight alternatives.

60,Using SBT from Scala IDE ,The path from SBT to Scala-IDE is well described in many places: What is the reverse for this? If I start a new project in Scala-IDE can I just add a build.sbt file and somehow tell Eclipse to use this when running the application? Apologies if this seems obvious to some but I've recently moved from ItelliJ Idea to Scala-IDE and I'm not certain about setting up Scala-IDE to use SBT and my sbt config files.No you cannot do this. The way to do it is as you described. Then whenever you make changes to build.sbt (e.g. new jar dependency) rerun the  command from sbt and refresh the project in Eclipse so that the newly generated files are reloaded. As a seasoned Eclipse user I wondered the same thing. Amazed that no one seemed to be going that direction I decided to roll my own project.  Install plugin create or modify build.sbt and dependencies are fetched project files updated. It works for me I use it every day. But it's not perfect or finished and I'm not putting in a lot of effort in it at the moment. But do feel free to contribute!
61,Python documentator IDE guiding ,Suppose I have such function: In my case the IDE has no way to know what goes in there.How I tell it by using comments? In case of PHP i've used something like this Another use case is when I know that in some case some proxy will return some objectIDE has no chance to know but I know for sure and want to specify this by comment to help myself in future and to help IDE.

67,Is there an online PHP IDE? ,"Is there an IDE for PHP where you can edit the code for your pages online? Real syntax highlighting is minimal. More would be great. I'd like to be able to do development on my site at times other than when I'm at home. even thera are some limits (no Internet nonnections no file manipulations) I have been trying for ages to find a really good online php editor with which a/to learn php and b/convert some old Delphi (!) source files into the 21st century.  After a couple of very disappointing experiences and irritating false starts most notably with phpanywhere (god did I have high hopes on first discovering that one:( ) I eventually stumbled upon ShiftEdit in Chrome webstore. So far I've been able to everything I need and as well as providing a simple but powerful enough set of tools; reliability and a general good approach to user interaction has meant that after a couple of weeks I eventually subscribed although free was good enough for my initial purposes and evaluation.  Take from that what you will but I wholeheartedly recommend it and also love their very quick iterative release process.  I don't know what your websites audience is but generally I think it's a bad idea to edit a live website. Much too easy to accidentally break something or worse  your passwords or other secrets by accident. I run my server from home so this will not be available to everyone but this is basically what I dp: If you have access to Google Chrome editor I think you should try ShiftEdit or SourceKit Apps from the web store. This one is specialized on PHP: click File Manager then select a file and click Code Editor. : I tried using it and it can highlight PHP and HTML (at the same time) and it also has a ""code completion"" feature... I'm not sure if that's what it's called but when you write an opening bracket or quote it writes the closing one after the cursor. The only problems are that the highlighting isn't perfect (it treats escaped quotes as actual quotes) and more importantly it's not free. Etherpad is cool to code collectively but it has no syntax highlighting and is not realy an IDE just a collaborative pad for programmers with versioning and chat features.Still pretty cool but not what youre looking for. We are making exactly this happen at very simple and useful php editor - to edit your scripts on FTP server  The new platform by the ""phpanywhere"" Team. I found it to be working very well. Interesting about it making it special is the Android and Iphone app which actually enables you to really code on the go. Thats an interesting idea.  One could use something like this:  to the syntax highlighting then it's just a matter of code completion for things like functions. That much is relatively simple it gets harder when you get into things like per file (or even included file) variables (for the code completion). And now that you have me thinking... It's to bad that I don't know javascript better.If anyone wants to get together and maybe build this idea into a viable project I'm definitely game. There is also  it allows C# VB Java PHP Ruby C++.

I really don't like  that much I find it buggy and a bit too clunky.I've started using  as a bare-bones but functional and > IDE. It has a basic code-completion feature and is a nice clean [Gnome] interface."". See  [edit]It does have it's own C++ class libs (as Hernan points out) but nothing stops you from using any other class libs like the SDL or you can roll your own. You can even use boost if you like but I must say I find some of the supplied classes &amp; techniques to be more useful."

Is it done using build system? How do I do it ?Tools -&gt; Build System -&gt; (choose) Python then:  Sublime Text probably can't find the Python Interpreter. When trying to run your program see the log and find the reference to Python in path. The point is that it tries to run python via command line the cmd looks like: If you can't run python from cmd Sublime Text can't too.(Try it yourself in cmd type python in it and run it python commandline should appear) You can either change the Sublime Text build formula or the System :*>for example:    manually: (preferable)Add  at the end of the string.
75,"ide - How do I ""Add Existing Item"" an entire directory structure in Visual Studio? ","I have a free standing set of files not affiliated with any C# project at all that reside in a complicated nested directory structure. I want to add them in that format to a different directory in an ASP.NET web application I am working on; while retaining the same structure. So I copied the folder into the target location of my project and I tried to “add existing  item” only to lose the previous folder hierarchy. Usually I have re-created the directories by hand copied across on a one-to-one basis and then added existing items. There are simply too many directories/items in this case. So how do you add existing directories and files in Visual Studio 2008?Drag the files / folders from Windows Explorer into the Solution Explorer. It will add them all. Note this doesn't work if Visual Studio is in Administrator Mode because Windows Explorer is a User Mode process. Enable > This is what I do: Then everything will be added on your solution from folders to files and files inside those folders. A neat trick I discovered is that if you go to ""Add existing..."" you can drag the folder from the open dialog to your solution. I have my Visual Studio to open in Admin Mode automatically so this was a good workaround for me as I didn't want to have to undo that just to get this to work. There is now an open-source extension in the Marketplace that seems to do what the OP was asking for:  If it doesn't do exactly what you want the code is available so you can modify it to suit your scenario. HTH What worked for me was to drag the folder into Visual Studio then right click the folder and select ""Open Folder in File Explorer"". Then select all and drag them into the folder in Visual Studio. In Windows 7 you could do the following: Right click on your project and select ""Add-&gt;Existing Item"". In the dialog which appears browse to the root of the directory you want to add. In the upper right corner you have a search box. Type  whatever the type of files you want to add. After the search finishes select all files click Add and wait for a while... The cleanest way that I've found to do this is to create a new Class Library project in the target folder and redirect all of its build output elsewhere.  It still leaves a .csproj file sitting in that folder but it does let you see it in Visual Studio and pick which files to include in your project. It's annoying that Visual Studio doesn't support this natively but CMake could generate the Visual Studio project as a work around. Other than that just use Qt Creator. It can then export a Visual Studio project."

In IDEA some  conflict with Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts. Some examples: I've been using Ubuntu for a long time and I'm used to these shortcuts. I use them all the time to switch between workspaces lock my session... At the same time I know how useful the IntelliJ shortcuts can be and I want to avoid using the mouse as much as possible. Currently my workaround for ""format source code"" is I use Ubuntu as well and I disabled the native (Ubuntu) command  to format the code and  for navigating backward Hope this helps This works for me in Ubuntu Studio 14.04 (XFCE): In order to disable XUbuntu's (xfce) keymap for  and I used .  Here I was able to clear these mappings. From the link to feature request provided by CrazyCoder: Actually there are several bundled schemes: ""Default for GNOME"" ""Default for KDE"" created exactly for that purpose.  I have not checked now particular shortcuts like Ctrl+Alt+L but these schemes were created to avoid conflicts with GNOME and KDE respectively. ""Default for Gnome"" did the trick for me (I'm on ArchLinux Gnome3 AndroidStudio/InteliJ) it remapped Navigate/Back to Shift+Alt+Left (was Ctrl+Alt+Left from ""Default for XWin"" and it didn't work). But now it switches may keyboard layout as well (Shift+Alt) another problem )) Probably I'll remap keypad switcher to something else it is still simpler then reassigning all the conflicting keys in IDE/OS. In 'Settings' section 'Keymap' you can choose the keymaps template from XWin Gnome Visual Studio Eclipse etc... This solve any problem in Ubuntu by choosing Gnome."

81,Difference between IDE and Framework ,What is a difference between an IDE and Framework with respect to Java?Basically : Quoting wikipedia an  : is a software application that  provides comprehensive facilities to  computer programmers for software  development. An IDE normally consists  of: While a  : is an abstraction in which common code  providing generic functionality can be  selectively overridden or specialized  by user code thus providing specific  functionality. Frameworks are a  special case of software libraries in  that they are reusable abstractions of  code wrapped in a well-defined  Application programming interface  (API) yet they contain some key  distinguishing features that separate  them from normal libraries. An IDE is an application used to write and compile code.  A framework is generally a software component that someone else wrote that you can use/integrate into your own project generally to avoid re-inventing the wheel. A framework is a tool that is closely attached to the language you are using and usually extends upon or adds the the language features. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) provides automation support for the language you use with regards to syntax highlighting of keywords errors building projects cleaning them intgegration with VCS etc. and usually provides default support for popular frameworks used for your language. Java makes use of frameworks like Hibernate Struts and Spring to extend the language and NetBeans or Intellij IDEA bring support for these tools to your Java project in a structured manor. As per all answers I can come to a conclusion that Visual Studio is an IDE and .NET is a framework.And also a framework(list of .dll) can be integrated into an IDE. Mean framework is a part of an IDE.
82,"c++ - What is the difference between #include &lt;filename&gt; and #include ""filename""? ","In the C and C++ programming languages what is the difference between using angle brackets and using quotes in an  statement as follows?In practice the difference is in the location where the preprocessor searches for the included file.

The preprocessing tokens after  option.    The argument of  searches a sequence of implementation-defined places for a header identified uniquely by the  specified sequence between the &lt; and &gt; delimiters and causes the  replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the header.  How the places are specified or the header identified is  implementation-defined. 3 A preprocessing directive of the form  causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the source file identified by the  specified sequence between the "" delimiters.

A preprocessing directive of the form (that does not match one of the two previous forms) is permitted. The preprocessing tokens after  defined folders. In C++ include a file in two ways: The first one is #include  which tells the preprocessor to look for the file in the predefined default location.This location is often an INCLUDE environment variable that denotes the path to include files. And the second type is #include ""filename"" which tells the preprocessor to look for the file in the current directory first then look for it in the predefined locations user have set up. the "" &lt; filename &gt; "" searches in standard C library locations whereas ""filename"" searches in the current directory as well. Ideally you would use &lt;...&gt; for standard C libraries and ""..."" for libraries that you write and are present in the current directory. The  syntax. The simple general rule is to use angled brackets to include header files that come with the compiler. Use double quotes to include any other header files. Most compilers do it this way. >. First looks for the presence of header file in the current directory from where directive is invoked. If not found then it searches in the preconfigured list of standard system directories. This looks for the presence of header file in the current directory from where directive is invoked. The exact search directory list depends on the target system how GCC is configured and where it is installed.You can find the search directory list of your GCC compiler by running it with -v option. You can add additional directories to the search path by using - I> which causes dir to be searched after the current directory (for the quote form of the directive) and ahead of the standard system directories.

87,Recommendations on PHP IDE ,"  I have been a .NET developer for years but may need to work on a PHP project soon. What editor/IDE should I use? ThanksPaulEclipse PDT seems to be a good choice basically it's a ""everything"" rolled package. Netbeans have been more and more supportive of PHP so it might be a good choice too. I'm no PHP expert by any means but went through the same question about 6 months back. .Net developer background deciding to do some PHP work on the side. I ended up using Eclipse for PHP developers which as far as I know is the core Eclipse application with additional plug-ins meant specifically for PHP development. For the most part I'm happy with it. The thing I miss most though is a nice auto-formatter for code the way  does in Visual Studio.  Eclipse does format it but not in a fashion I'm partial towards.

88,Is Matlab an IDE? ,"I'm a little confused as to what classifies as an IDE. According to Wikipedia: An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. So is MatLab considered an IDE? As with many things in software there are no hard rules. But if anything fits the description of IDE matlab does.  The basic engine can be run purely from the command line but when you marry that with the graphical environment it has all the hallmarks of an IDE - richly featured text editor debugging support memory/workspace introspection etc etc.  In some ways the IDE is what you pay for. Minus that there's little advantage over open source numerical languages like Python or Julia.  MatLab workbooks could be considered and IDE. Depending how you define ""comprehensive facilities"" Vim is an IDE."
89,java - How to call a SOAP web service on Android ,"I am having a lot of trouble finding good information on how to call a standard SOAP/WSDL web service with Android. All I've been able to find are either very convoluted documents and references to ""kSoap2"" and then some bit about parsing it all manually with  based web service from an Android-based phone.Android does not provide any sort of SOAP library. You can either write your own or use something like . As you note others have been able to compile and use kSOAP2 in their own projects but I haven't had to. Google has shown to date little interest in adding a SOAP library to Android. My suspicion for this is that they'd rather support the current trends in Web Services toward REST-based services and using JSON as a data encapsulation format. Or using XMPP for messaging. But that is just conjecture. XML-based web services are a slightly non-trivial task on Android at this time. Not knowing NetBeans I can't speak to the tools available there but I agree that a better library should be available. It is possible that the XmlPullParser will save you from using SAX but I don't know much about that.  comes in the Android SDK by default. That'll get you connected to the WSDL. It's true that due to it's overhead SOAP is not the best choice for data exchange with mobile devices. However you might find yourself in situation in which you do not control the format of server output. So if you have to stick with SOAP there is a kSOAP2 library patched for Android here: Basically it allows you to build up envelopes to send via a simple Java API then automatically parses them into objects that you define via XPath... for example: Becomes: I was using it for my own project but I figured it might help some other people so I've spent some time separating it out and documenting it. I'd really love it if some of your poor souls who stumble on this thread while googling ""SOAP Android"" could give it a go and get some benefit. DON'T FORGET TO ADD ksoap2.jar in your project and also add the  INTERNET permission in AndroidManifest file I had my tryst with KSOAP; I chose a rather simpler approach. Given a WSDL file create SOAP Request templates for each Request(for e.g.: using SOAP UI) and then substitute the values to be passed in code. POST this data to the service end point using DefaultHttpClient instance and get the response stream. Parse the Response Stream using an XML Pull parser.

95,IDE for Grinder scripting ,I'm looking for a IDE for the Grinder framework 3.11. Can someone please suggest me an IDE to develop and run Grinder(3.11) scripts. Grinder-stone for eclipse is no longer supported. Unfortunately there are no good IDE options today for doing fully-integrated Grinder script development.  Nothing has come along to fill Grinderstone's shoes.  Your best bet is to go with a decent Java/Python/Jython development tool such as PyDev or PyCharm or IntelliJ.  It won't have the Grinder integration but any of these tools will be helpful for everything else. I was in your shoes few days back however you need to configure pydev which will save a lot of time . You can integrated Grinder on your own by creating a bat file and giving the path of scripts to the one in eclipse . This worked for me.

Be prepared to allow half a gig of memory then you'll need to shut down and restart. A step above a Text Editor. Does not support database connections or split views. Color coding and syntax checking are there to an extent. The project control on Komodo is very unwieldy and strange compared to the other IDEs. The perfect solution.

Downside:  Not a supported product any more.  Aptana Studio 2.0+ uses PDT which is a watered down under-developed (at present) php plug in. Good for Javascript/HTML/CSS but only marginal for PHP. There is some color coding but no syntax checking or code completion native to the package. Database connections are supported and so are split views. I'm using NetBeans which is free and feature rich. I can deal with the memory issues for a while but it could be slow coming to the MAC.

Download angular js from this link and add as new software in eclipse Configuration worked with Eclipse Mars 4.5 version. 1) Install Eclipse Mars 4.5 from This comes with Tern and embedded Node.js server 2) Install AngularJS Eclipse plugin from Eclipse Marketplace 3) Configure node.js server to the embedded nodejs server within Eclipse (found in the eclipse plugins folder) at Windows-&gt; Preferences -&gt; JavaScript -&gt; Tern -&gt; Server -&gt; node.js. No extra configurations are required. 4) Test configuration in a html or javascript file.   Hi Guys if u are using angular plugin in eclipse that time is plugin is limited periods after that if u want to used this plugin then u pay it so i suggest to you used webstrome and visual code ide that are very easy and comfort to used so take care if u start and developed a angular app using eclipse 
100,vim - Modal fully fledged IDE ,I am trying to find a good IDE. I always found Vim's modal behaviour interesting but Vim is more of a text editor than an IDE. Even though I have made a few changes to my .vimrc file Vim isn't IDE enough. Any suggestions? FYI: By IDE I mean it's got to have a debugger autocomplete and easy compilation  Edit: I do web development backend node.js python and Ruby on RailsI'd start by listing features you need from your IDE in order of importance.  Think about (random order): Of course you can consider many more features and find them much more important than the ones I listed here. It's totally individual preference since that's you who has to be comfortable.  If you want to use the power of VIM you have basically three options:  Start with vanilla VIM and incrementally add settings and plugins you need. Check out existing configs and adapt them. To make it fully fledged IDE I'd recommend some plugins:  I recommend one of these: or this:  It also depends what your programming environment is. Having autocomplete and compiling from in the vim editor is no problem. Debugging depends but you can also do debugging with other tools and be perfectly fine. Just because other IDEs do it doesn't mean it's the best way. Don't try to get it perfect just from the beginning and don't try to copy every feature your known IDE has. Accept the initial pain and enjoy all those little improvements that you can make every single day. All those improvements will sum up and after a while you will be very proficient. Even years after you still will find ways to improve your workflow. There has been recent development in (at least) those three projects based on nvim extensibility and addressing your very concern: I seems that they are all in early alpha though let's hope the best for them :)
101,Is there any online IDE for Java? ,It doesn't have to be full blown of course and console output only would be enough.  I'd like it to be able to work on some program parts on any PC which has internet connection.   I'm really looking for a lightweight IDE I can also use for quick testsYou can use  There is an online editor for any FTP server. It's tageted to PHP (bacause it's the common way to work with PHP) but you can use it for java too.
102,java - JRE JDK and IDE revisited ,I know this question must've been asked alot of times already but I've got some specific questions that need answering to. The underlying question I am trying to ask here is . I understand that JRE has the run time libraries JDK contains the compiler/debugger and everything else that JRE has. IDE is my Eclipse.  : When exactly will I need just the JRE and nothing else? i.e. under what circumstances will only having JRE suffice. If I were to emulate such behaviour what are the necessary steps required. (> ) Thanks If all you want to do is run an already compiled Java program then a JRE is all you need. So if you were developing software for someone else you'd have JDK and IDE installed on your machine for development purposes but you'd only need to install the JRE on the client machine for them to be able to run it. Question 1 : If I am trying to develop something in Java is it  necessary that I need JDK for it? Because as I understand I can make  do with IDE + JRE. My IDE provides me with compiler/debugger and I  will refer the JRE from my IDE. So it should be alright right? As you said JDK is required for compilation and JRE is required for running the program. No matter who provides(IDE or system path) if you have those you should be able to compile and run your programs. Question 2 : From the above question is it safe to say that IDE  contains JDK in it already? You can't generalise the statement tha IDE contains JDK. Few does few may not. Question 3 : When exactly will I need just the JRE and nothing else?  i.e. under what circumstances will only having JRE suffice. If I were  to emulate such behaviour what are the necessary steps required. (I  can make it more clear if you have not understood it. ) If you have classes/jar with you. You can run them without needing JDK. Answering > java code.   Yes some IDEs like Eclpse ship jdk with the ide. The downside you can't use cmd prompt to execute java code.  You'll need JRE to run every applications thats been written in Java. When you will implement your project you'll have to setup JRE to your client in order for them to run it.
103,Best IDE/Editor for ColdFusion? ,"I am just starting at a job in which I will be using a lot of ColdFusion. What is the best IDE/Editor to use?I'd like to provide my personal reasoning behind why you might choose any of these editors (at least the ones I'm familiar with). Just saying ""use this use that"" is not at all helpful. To large degree the question is wrong. There's rarely a ""best IDE"" for a language; rather there are multiple environments each suiting particular needs. Here goes: 1) Dreamweaver Why you would use it: its history as a designer tool makes it much easier for ""non-coder"" types to start cranking out websites. If you're a solo developer building a lot of ""Tom's Corner Store"" type of sites even if they require some CF Coding (mailing list subscribers current specials light content management etc) its design tools ""template"" features and ease-of-deployment (ftp) make it an attractive choice. It has good-enough code coloring and code completion for the built-in CF tags and functions. It can interrogate user-defined functions in the same page. It has excellent CSS support. You can find a wealth of extensions too.  It's pretty stable and in my experience hasn't been very ""crashy"". It will do a fair amount of code generation for you as well (whether that code is ""good"" is debatable).  All in all Dreamweaver is incredible software for web site designers. Why you wouldn't use it: It is not free and it is certainly not a ""coder's editor"". While it provides for extensions they're typically interface-focused (javascript validation etc) unlike say Eclipse plugins which can run the gamut. For large projects it simply does not have the code navigation features that many coders come to expect. It's web-focused. So if you're a polyglot or even just like to dabble in compiled languages (java etc) then you'll need to keep another editor on hand for those tasks.... you won't be able to do it all in one place.  ColdFusion unit testing support is nonexistent in Dreamweaver. There is no step debugging for ColdFusion. 2) CFEclipse plugged into Eclipse.  Why you'd use it: CFEclipse is going on 6 years old now and has matured significantly. It's been quite stable for the last few years and most crashiness has been due to Eclipse itself and not CFEclipse (which was not true in the early days). Recently CFEclipse has seen an infusion of fresh blood and features are being added to make coding in it even more productive.  It contains a wealth of keyboard shortcuts many of the toolbar features people love from ColdFusion Studio days and Eclipse's in-built code navigation features (namely Ctrl-Shift-R for finding files quickly). It has content assist for native CF Tags and functions and some support for in-page variables though that's never worked all that well. It does not support in-page functions nor does it provide native true component insight (i.e. insight into components that you write and use in other code). It will support component insight to some extent with Dictionaries but even then it requires a lot of work on the part of the dictionary creator. Most people find dictionaries too much work to maintain in my experience. The lastest version of CFEclipse contains the best CFML formatting you'll find.  For me ""method explorer"" and ""Snip Tree View"" -- particularly keyboard shortcuts for inserting snippets -- have been big productivity boosters. If you work with ColdSpring ModelGlue Mach-II ColdBox and other frameworks with xml configuration files CFEclipse's Framework Explorer is brilliant. Because it's a plugin to Eclipse you can do everything else you'd want to do in Eclipse. You wanna code java? You can. You want webservice support? you got that. You want to do step debugging you can do so with the free Adobe-provided extensions for Eclipse. The large plugin ecosystem is one of the most attractive features of Eclipse and you shouldn't discount this when deciding on an editor. For example I would not want to work without Mylyn which integrates with issue tracking and in my experience has transformed the way I work much for the better. Eclipse's version control system support is excellent as well. Subversion is well supported; there's a VSS plugin; and recently a git plugin (if not two) has been accepted into the Eclipse foundation so we'll see native git support very soon (you can get it now with a plugin). Eclipse's ANT support is excellent.  You can easily plug the MXUnit Eclipse plugin into Eclipse for unit testing your CFML (full disclosure: I contribute to MXUnit). Finally I have full confidence that the folks working on CFEclipse -- Denny Mark Jim Peter et al. -- will continue to work toward keeping CFEclipse as the best open source CFML IDE available. These are some of the brightest minds in the ColdFusion community and are passionate about their mission. If you choose to use CFEclipse you are not choosing to use an IDE that will be supplanted by ColdFusion Builder. This project is in good hands. Why you wouldn't use it: it's a code IDE not a design tool like Dreamweaver. It's not perfect... code assist can be too aggressive in its suggestions. Eclipse itself especially when you pile it up with all kinds of plugins can get unstable on lesser machines.  Finally people who don't like the ""Project"" view of the world often have complaints about it because they're used to working directly with the file system view of the world. Its deployment support is nowhere near as simple as Dreamweaver though you can find plugins that get close. 3) ColdFusion Builder Why you'd use it: all of what I said previously about Eclipse itself applies to CFBuilder when used as a plugin to Eclipse. I cannot speak to the Standalone version because as of this writing it still doesn't support plugins very well. This will most surely be fixed by the time it is released but I don't want to speculate on what the Standalone may or may not do. One of CFBuilder's big draws is ""Extensions"". These are a way to plug in CFML code into your editor. It's hard to describe so I'd suggest googling for ""ColdFusion Builder Extensions"" and you'll most likely be amazed. Adobe's Terry Ryan has created ""Apptacular"" for scaffolding applications from a database and Brian Rinaldi has a series of posts on building CFBuilder extensions. These are huge and will prove themselves to be a developer's best friend after CFBuilder is released. CFBuilder's deployment support is in my opinion on par with if not superior to Dreamweaver's. CFBuilder does not require an additional plugin to do step debugging. Just hit the debug button and off you go. CFBuilder contains true component insight meaning that it can introspect components you write and provide ctrl-space content assist. It can be wonky however and does require some configuration. But please remember that as of now CFBuilder is still in beta. My best guess is that it'll be at least a few versions until all the kinks are worked out of this feature. Still it's a big productivity and learning booster to get content assist on your own components. CFBuilder provides a ""Servers"" view for stopping/starting your CF Server. It's built on Aptana and so contains the Aptana ""tail log"" view which is great for watching log files. Just like CFEclipse it has a Snip Tree View. The CFBuilder ""vision"" is led by Adobe's Adam Lehman. He's passionate about CF and is a force of nature. I have great hopes for CFBuilder because of Adam's leadership. Why you wouldn't use it: For one it won't be free. Noone outside Adobe knows yet how much it will cost however. ""Extensions"" and the deployment features alone may be worth the price. Time will tell. Because it's an Adobe product I think it's reasonable to assume that releases will come as frequently as most Adobe products which means... not very often. While CFEclipse deploys rather frequently lately -- and makes available a ""nightly"" site for the brave -- CFBuilder will most likely not do such daring-do. CFEclipse can afford to make potentially unstable builds available to the public while it is perhaps not in Adobe's best interests to do so with CFBuilder. Finally it's still in Beta and might not be released for some time. If you get it now and start using it remember that. In my experience debugging is wonky content assist sometimes works sometimes doesn't and a lot of people have experience crashiness. It's free beta software... you're getting what you pay for. But know that the more you work with this beta release and particularly if you provide feedback via the public bug database the better off all of us will be if it provides a best of breed editor for CFML. Personally: At home when I do ""designer"" work I use Dreamweaver when I feel that its Templates will help me build a site as quickly as possible. For existing side projects which require maintenance coding and easy deployments I use ColdFusion builder. At work where I do almost no design work CFEclipse has been my IDE since 2006. I've begun using ColdFusion builder a lot though currently I split my time between CFBuilder and CFEclipse. One reason is that as of this writing CFEclipse is more stable (i.e. it doesn't crash and I don't lose work). I fully expect stability problems to be mitigated by the time CFBuilder costs money.  Both CFBuilder and CFEclipse have public bug databases. CFEclipse has a well-attended public mailing list and if you have questions you'll get answers quickly. I cannot yet speak to the speed with which CFBuilder questions are answered. Finally for ""coders"" it's my experience that once you invest the time in learning the tools and shortcuts Eclipse provides superior productivity compared with designer tools like Dreamweaver. For cranking out a designed site a designer tool like Dreamweaver confers significant advantages. The answer to the best ColdFusion IDE isn't an answer but a question: ""What are you trying to do with ColdFusion?"" The answer to that question will lead you to an IDE that suits your needs for a particular project. Different circumstances or projects may lead you to a different tool which better suits your needs. Notepad++ with CF syntax highlighting. For free: Eclipse with CFEclipes plugin For cost: If you're a developer use Coldfusion Builder if you're a front end designer Dreamweaver edits Coldfusion pretty well. I use it quite often. I have heavily used Dreamweaver CFeclipse with eclipse and now Coldfusion Builder.  What I found is this:  - This is Adobe's version of CFeclipse.  It's still pretty new and getting to later beta.  I switched to it about 6 months ago and haven't looked back.  It's got a lot of wizards including the ability to write your own plugins in CFML that will run right inside CFbuilder.  It's free right now on beta but will likely be pretty cheap like the first flex builder that came out. My Choice: Coldfusion Builder.  It doesn't mean the others aren't capable but you'll spend the least amoutn of time getting setup and maintaining your plugins etc.   Since I had paid for and used Dreamweaver for a lot of years (Eclipse was generally sluggish sometimes on PCs' a while back until the excess of ram + cpu today) spending to have an adobe maintained copy of eclipse is okay with me.  The wizards available in CFbuilder especially for flex are excellent. Hope that helps good luck and share what you ended up picking and why! For anyone who might stumble here from Google you should also take a look at  and other community driven content.   Some of the highlights of E is that it will allow you to open a directory and treat it directory as a project. Hitting Shift-Ctrl T will allow you to browse all the files in your project in a flattened hierarchy which allows you to find files extremely fast. "

105,NetBeans IDE scaling on Windows 8/10 ,"I'm trying to run NetBeans under Windows 8.1 on a screen with a high DPI. Windows itself has scaling enabled to 400% and everything else looks just fine. However when I start NetBeans it runs as if there's no scaling enabled and I just see tiny little letters in the IDE. I did check the properties under which the IDE starts and they do have ""Enable scaling for this program"" checked. I could increase font size in the editor and the error log which would at least enable me to view what I'm typing on the screen however all menus side-bars panels etc remain very small which is very uncomfortable trying to work with. So any idea how I can make NetBeans scale with Windows 8.1? Currently using NetBeans 8.0.A workaround is to increase the font size of menu options. See: ).  The fix is quite simple: First set Windows to prefer external manifest files over internal ones (which was default until some Versions ago) by adding the key to Then create a manifest file (in this case netbeans64.exe.manifest or netbeans.exe.manifest) in the directory of the corresponding exe file with the following content: This way I also could fix Visual Studio 2013 and SQL Server Management Console 2012 which are only partly dpi aware (e.g. Visual Studio 2013 the form editor is unusable on 200% as the complete layout is broken). I fixed all my apps that were unusable or at least had a bad layout this way.  As this thread was the first one in my google results I thought it would be a good idea to post this solution although the last activity is quite long ago. Windows 10 does this for you now. Right click on your Netbeans shortcut (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\NetBeans) and select Properties. Go to the Compatibility tab and then select Change High DPI Settings. From there check the Override High DPI Scaling box and set it to System.  Similar to setting  if you use the Darcula plugin you can set the value for the ""Override Default Fonts"" option to 18. That has the same effect. Additionally if you change it to Segoe UI it matches Windows 10 nicely. go to display settings and change scale and layout to 100% Boom! :) Simply hold down the  then scroll up or down to zoom out or in"
106,Selenium IDE - sideflow.js loops ,I wanted to create testcase with loops. I got latest : latest from this page  How to make it work? Thanks in advance.If you want to create a loop the following is suggested. I am still learning so I am not sure but this has worked for me. Instead of  write it as Here is an example triple array looper (With static variables so you can see it changing) This is a custom one I have made notice the syntax for storing incremental variables (Such as counters e.t.c.) This looper will cycle through all of your options (In the example below there are 6*5*4=120 options). It echo's each option out once and then moves onto the next one. I opted to remove all the html tagging (So the gaps should be quite evident). StoreEval command is best for holding your loop counters because you can then use them as incrementals in one step instead of 2.

108,eclipse - How do you debug PHP scripts? ,"How do you debug  (in terms of fast and easy) way to debug in phpStorm or any other IDE?Try  which I never used. I use Netbeans with XDebug. Check it out at its website for docs on how to configure it.  The add-on is essential when you debug MVC projects because the normal way XDebug runs in Netbeans is to register the dbug session via the url. With the add-on installed in FireFox you would set your Netbeans project properties -&gt; Run Configuratuion -&gt; Advanced and select ""Do Not Open Web Browser"" You can now set your break points and start the debugging session with Ctrl-F5 as usual. Open FireFox and right-click the Add-on icon in the right bottom corner to start monitoring for breakpoints. When the code reaches the breakpoint it will stop and you can inspect your variable states and call-stack. Output buffering is very useful if you don't want to mess up your output. I do this in a one-liner which I can comment/uncomment at will  PhpEdit has a built in debugger but I usually end up using echo(); and print_r(); the old fashioned way!! For the really gritty problems that would be too time consuming to use print_r/echo to figure out I use my IDE's (PhpEd) debugging feature.  Unlike other IDEs I've used PhpEd requires pretty much no setup.  the only reason I don't use it for any problems I encounter is that it's > slow.  I'm not sure that slowness is specific to PhpEd or any php debugger.  PhpEd is not free but I believe it uses one of the open-source debuggers (like XDebug previously mentioned) anyway.  The benefit with PhpEd again is that it requires no setup which I have found really pretty tedious in the past. Manual debugging is generally quicker for me -  in the tmp folder and tail it in the terminal with the command... It give's you running dialog from cake of what is going on which is pretty handy if you want to output something to it mid code you can use. This can usually give you a good idea of what is going on/wrong. print_r( debug_backtrace() ); or something like that :-) Komodo IDE works well with xdebug even for the remore debugging. It needs minimum amount of configuration. All you need is a version of php that Komodo can use locally to step through the code on a breakpoint. If you have the script imported into komodo project then you can set breakpoints with a mouse-click just how you would set it inside eclipse for debugging a java program.Remote debugging is obviously more tricky to get it to work correctly ( you might have to map the remote url with a php script in your workspace ) than a local debugging setup which is pretty easy to configure if you are on a MAC or a linux desktop. Nusphere is also a good debugger for php There are many PHP debugging techniques that can save you countless hours when coding. An effective but basic debugging technique is to simply turn on error reporting. Another slightly more advanced technique involves using print statements which can help pinpoint more elusive bugs by displaying what is actually going onto the screen. PHPeclipse is an Eclipse plug-in that can highlight common syntax errors and can be used in conjunction with a debugger to set breakpoints. and also used In a production environment I log relevant data to the server's error log with error_log(). i use zend studio for eclipse with the built in debugger. Its still slow compared to debugging with eclipse pdt with xdebug. Hopefully they will fix those issues the speed has improved over the recent releases but still stepping over things takes 2-3 seconds.The zend firefox toolbar really makes things easy (debug next page current page etc). Also it provides a profiler that will benchmark your code and provide pie-charts execution time etc. The most of bugs can be found easily by simply ing some of key variables but it obviously depends on what kind of application you develop. For a more complex algorithms the step/breakpoint/watch functions are very helpful (if not necessary) The Interactive Stepthrough PHP Debugger implemented as a SAPI module which can give give you complete control over the environment without impacting the functionality or performance of your code. It aims to be a lightweight powerful easy to use debugging platform for PHP 5.4+ and it's shipped out-of-box with PHP 5.6. Features includes: See the screenshots:  at php.net +1 for print_r(). Use it to dump out the contents of an object or variable. To make it more readable do it with a pre tag so you don't need to view source.  Also var_dump($thing) - this is very useful to see the type of subthings Depending on the issue I like a combination of error_reporting(E_ALL) mixed with echo tests (to find the offending line/file the error happened in initally; you KNOW it's not always the line/file php tells you right?) IDE brace matching (to resolve ""Parse error: syntax error unexpected $end"" issues) and print_r(); exit; dumps (real programmers view the source ;p).  You also can't beat phpdebug (check sourceforge) with ""memory_get_usage();"" and ""memory_get_peak_usage();"" to find the problem areas. The integrated debuggers where you can watch the values of variable change as you step through code are really cool. They do however require software setup on the server and a certain amount of configuration on the client. Both of which require periodic maintenance to keep in good working order. A print_r is easy to write and is guaranteed to work in any setup. Usually I find create a custom log function able to save on file store debug info and eventually re-print on a common footer. You can also override common Exception class so that this type of debugging is semi-automated."
109,Is Eclipse the best IDE for Java? ,"Is Eclipse the best  for Java?  If not is there something better?  I want to know and possibly try it out.  Thanks.Let me just start out by saying that Eclipse is a > affordable (last I heard $50 for the distro plus a year of free upgrades). If you have the budget and need the added functionality I'd go with something like that. Anyway I've tried to be as detailed as I can. I hope this helps and good luck on your search! :) IntelliJ IDEA was awsome. Now it is just ""better than Eclipse"". You can code in IDEA several times faster than in Eclipse in my experience (I moved from being an Eclipse early-adopter to IDEA and haven't looked back) but IDEA has a number of flaws: I still wouldn't go back though; the code refactorings and intentions in IDEA are just too good. A major version of Eclipse came out a while back and it took me about an hour of searching on the website to figure out what was actually contained in the release which might persuade me back into the fold. Visit  to see how to sell an IDE! There is no best IDE. You make it as good as you get used using it. Eclipse can't remotely be called an IDE to my opinion. Okay that's exaggerated I know. It merely reflects my intense agony thanks to eclipse! Whatever you do it just doesn't work! You always need to fight with it to make it do things the right way. During that time you're not developing code which is what you're supposed to do right? eclipse and maven integration: unreliable! Eclipse and ivy integration: unreliable. WTP: buggy buggy buggy! Eclipse and wstl validation: buggy! It complains about not finding URL's out of the blue even though they do exist and a few days later without having changed them it suddenly does find them etc etc. I Could write a frakking book about it. To answer your question: NO ECLIPSE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE THE BEST IDE!!! IntelliJ is supposed to be MUCH better! Eclipse was the first IDE to move me off of XEmacs.  However when my employer offered to buy me a Intellij IDEA license if I wanted one it only took 3 days with an evaluation copy to convince me to go for it. It seems like so many small things are just nicer. IntelliJ is good one but its not free!!Then NetBeans is also a good option.Also if you are IBM suite WSAD is good I'd have to vote for Netbeans as the best one currently.  Eclipse is decent but right now Netbeans is better. I used IntelliJ for almost 5+ years (from v1.5 to v7) and around 8 months ago I migrated to IBM RAD (which is built on top of old eclipse platform) and around 3 months ago I settled down with Eclipse (Ganymede). I used IntelliJ on a mid size projects (with 10k classes) and I'm using Eclipse on one with just few hundreds of classes. I found both of these IDEs (IntelliJ and Eclipse) to be good. IBM RAD is just a waste of money (ofcourse one could be stuck in an IBM shop without choice). IntelliJ has far superior refactoring capabilities and keyboard shortcuts for most of the features compared to Eclipse. It supports importing projects from Eclipse. It has better built in xml handling capabilities (with refactorings applicable almost like for the java code). Built in Intelli Sense is also very good. Eclipse is a great tool and its free. It took me around 1-2 months to get used to Eclipse from IntelliJ (lot of unlearning of shortcuts) but I got hang of Eclipse it has been pretty smooth. I havent used Eclipse on mid size project. Both IntelliJ and Eclipse have active plugin communities and both integrate well with version control systems unit test frameworks application servers and profilers. IntelliJ started becoming slow and bloated starting from v4.0. It was slow with mid size projects. I would not use IntelliJ unless its performance can be improved. I havent used these two IDEs for anything other than java development. If you are a java developer and your company pays for IntelliJ and if your project is not too big go for it. Otherwise dont despair: Eclipse is always there. I gave Eclipse a 3 months ride at my new work but after that I found out that normal Maven project can be run in IntelliJ IDEA too (unless it's Eclipse plugin/EMF/something of course ;-)). 3 months are not enough to compare it with 8+ years with IDEA but it's enough to claim I gave it a fair try. I decided to live with its perspectives (other IDEs don't need them) with its poor debugger (doesn't show date values unless you click on them! etc.) with its comparatively worse completion than IDEA has. Now after all those years IDEA is also free (community edition) and I use it without much trouble. Of course I miss some of those ""Ultimate"" features of paid version but it's far better than Eclipse. Biggest difference is the whole mindset needed for both of these IDEs. But after you master the mindset of either I can't understand what can anyone hold to Eclipse - unless you need its plugin ecosystem or you have some serious investments there. Example of ""mindset"" differences: You have to save in Eclipse not in IDEA and I don't care what is better or worse - but you have to save in Eclipse to let him clean up underlined errors that are not errors anymore etc. ;-) You have to save there in order to get rid of errors in other files too because other file doesn't see the changes otherwise. I blogged much more about this topic - and yes I'm biased though I tried to be as little as possible. But after some time it wasn't simply possible: :-) And no not even IDEA is perfect I know it. Because I use it a lot. But it is the best Java IDE if you ask me. Even the Community edition. [This is not really an answer just an anecdote. I worked with guys who used emacs heavily loaded with macros and color coded. Crazy! Why do that when there are so many good IDEs out there?] if you know you way around emacs you can code 100x faster then an IDE. And it can handle bunch of diffrent languages so you do not need to change your coding enviroment if you need to code in another language. Works on all operating systems you can custimize/add anything you want. Even edit files half way across the world over ssh.(no downloading or uploading).Before calling them crazy you gotto use it first. i am sure they are calling you crazy for using an IDE :). It is often said that there are better IDE's for various languages (eg Java) than Eclipse. The power of Eclipse is that it's basically the same IDE for > languages meaning that if you know you'll have to code in several programming languages (Java C++ Python) it's a huge advantage that you only have to learn one IDE: Eclipse. I don't know if Eclipse is THE BEST Java IDE but it is definitely very decent and my favorite IDE. I tried IntelliJ briefly before and found that it's pretty similar to Eclipse (IntelliJ might offer some nicer features but Eclipse is free and open source).I never really tried NetBean because I know Eclipse before I know NetBean. Eclipse is my favorite because: If you are used to using conventional Java IDE like JCreator you might need some time to get used to Eclipse. I remember when I first learned Eclipse I didn't know how to compile Java source...   I would suggest that in order to find the best IDE FOR YOU try what people recommended (NetBean Eclipse and IntelliJ) and see which one you like the most then stick with it and become an expert of it. Having the right IDE will boost up your productivity a lot in my opinion.  Eclipse!  It can be slow at times and uses a lot of memory but it works well. I am going to have to recommend  by my job. I find the UI design much better than Eclipse. Also it comes with an incredible amount of features built in including great support for EJB3 JSF WebServices etc. It is essentially an IDE for the entire JavaEE stack (and the Oracle ADF framework as well). - All of the tools you will (probably) need for JavaEE development come with this IDE right out of the box no plugins required (unless you download the minimalist version). Talking about java Ide it is better to go for NetBeans.In My opinion it is better and provide great advantage over other ide but it has disadvantage over Eclipse that it grabs more more while working but do to its features and support i suggest Netbeans than any ide This is subjective... I find it to be a good tool. It depends what kind of development you're doing - for EJB stuff many folk would favour Netbeans. It also depends how much you want to spend - I assume you're talking about free IDEs? In my opinion if you got the resources to use then go with eclipse. NetBeans which is awesome like eclipse is another best option these are the only 2 I've ever used (loved needed wanted) Eclipse is hands down the most popular and for good reason! Hope this helps. Agreeing with the others. Netbeans is a pretty good IDE which also caters for other languages (PHP Ruby C/C++) if you're prone to using any of those. Then you get the added benefit of knowing your way around the IDE when deciding to pick up a new language. To be fair however I haven't had much time with the eclipse IDE. I'd agree with some of the others out there saying that NetBeans and IntelliJ are both good IDEs.  And I'd say that in using all three (Eclipse + other two) that Eclipse is by far my favorite.  I found some of the documentation out-dated but also found the support community very helpful.  I started using Eclipse by jumping into the deep end of the pool:  writing an RCP before ever learning the IDE.  The IDE was intuitive to use and when I found the right news groups to post to - most of my questions were already answered.  The hardest thing for me (and frustrating admittedly) was knowing how to phrase my search terms in order to get to the answer that was already posted. Remember that Eclipse is still ""relatively new"" as an IDE player though given that - it's pretty darn robust. My only complaint about Eclipse is that with each new release it seems to hog up more resources.  With a mid-sized project/workspace it takes seemingly forever to build (or rebuild) the project.  Compared to IntelliJ it's faster and more intuitive to use. Don't forget that Eclipse Platform was started by IBM. There are few platforms out there. The advantage with Eclipse is that it can be customized to your development pleasure plugins can be written for Eclipse to conform to your needs (e.g. The Eclipse ""Easy Explorer"" plugin for browsing the directory of your source in Windows Explorer).Eclipse allows you to also incorporate other languages/SDK's such as C++ Silverlight projects Android Projects for development. You can also easily manage resources in Eclipse. In my experience NetBeans are resource intensive. Oracle JDeveloper and IntelliJ aren't free though.Oh yes If you have issues or bugs with Eclipse Eclipse has the ability to restart and submit the crash to Eclipse servers. This is not really an answer just an anecdote.  I worked with guys who used emacs heavily loaded with macros and color coded.  Crazy!  Why do that when there are so many good IDEs out there? I have experience with using . I like it because it is easy to use and it is free. Give it a try if it interests you."
110,javascript - Efficient usage of WebStorm IDE ,I've recently fallen in love in WebStorm as an IDE for JavaScript development. The problem is I come from a world of vim and lightweight editors so I probably can't fully appreciate all the power that comes with IDE. Yes I've seen the presentations and read the docs but there's a lot of features and I'm not sure which of them are truly useful. So here goes my question: how do you use WebStorm and what do you find most useful? Any power-usage tips? Configuration hacks? Plugins worth mentioning? I'm not looking for a list of features I'm looking for a real-world usage examples and impressions. PS. I work mostly with pure JS + Canvas element and some NodeJS.Some random thoughts maybe more later.... In the help definitely read the Basic Concepts and skim the WebStorm Usage Guidelines for actions that you care about. Learn to use  Ctrl-Shift-A. It allows you to 1uickly find actions you can do by typing part of them. With that you can find anything once you know it exists. WebStorm's (like IntelliJ) best magic is its code completion and refactoring features which come from its code parsing and awareness. It figures a lot of stuff out but you can help it out by making you have good source files. Put the commented versions of the libraries you use in your project so it can use those comments to display in the doc popups (just having them in the directory is all you need). Be sure to leave the tips on. Their forums are useful but if you have a problem or feature request put it right into youtrack.com. They are much more responsive there. You can also vote for the stuff you want added. And if you haven't seen it yet there is a VIM plugin which will give you VIM editor keys called  JsTestDriver integration. Plugins. You can always find something useful.
111,Why would a Delphi programmer use Lazarus as the IDE instead of using Delphi's IDE? ,I've been very happy with the Delphi IDE for programming in Delphi.  But I've heard about the  says: The first thing to do when converting  a Delphi project  Having opened  Lazarus you should go to to Tools and  then Convert Delphi Project to Lazarus  Project. This won't do everything for  you but nonetheless will take you a  good deal of the way. Note that the  Lazarus IDE's conversion tools are  generally one-way conversions. If you  need to retain Delphi compatibility so  you can compile your project with both  Delphi and Lazarus consider  converting your files with the XDev  ToolkitWell a Delphi programmer cannot use Lazarus to write Delphi code because Lazarus is not Delphi. Lazarus is actually an IDE and a bunch of Delphi-ish class libraries for Free Pascal. But note things like Delphi's VCL is not there and to be perfectly blunt the IDE and debugging experiences in Lazarus are pretty spotty however it is free so that counts for a lot. Bottom line Delphi &lt;&gt; Lazarus. Use Delphi if you want a great IDE and debugger huge 3rd party support and tech suport you are targeting MS Windows plus you are willing to pay for it. Use Lazarus (free pascal) if you want a Free IDE that supports multiple platforms and has a Delphi-ish syntax. Ok. This is an old thread but could do with some updating. I stopped using Delphi maybe a decade ago largely because I had no choice. Having spent 5+ years working as a Delphi coder I was now a student again and the prices for Delphi were simply outrageous.  The problem with Delphi was never Delphi. Delphi was a genius system but Borland (and later its successors) completely misunderstood the changing computer world. Microsoft was able to deliver a programming environment that you could download for free and its .NET environment was comparable with the VCL in all the important ways meanwhile even a basic version of Delphi would break your bank or be plain out unavailable to student budgets. The end result is that with no new Delphi programmers coming on-line it became a risky proposition for businesses to continue to use. Finally with the rise of linux Kylix turned out to be a total trainwreck of an environment not utilizing available UI toolchains and with a suspicious stench of Wine pervading it topped off with an insulting attitude to GPL software that treated it as if it was shareware. Finally when Turbo Delphi came out many years later it was unable to utilize the amazing resources available via sites like tories component sites. It was clear Borland had no respect at all for its coder ecosystem. So Lazarus seemed to emerge out of all this taking a very long time to gestate and seemingly aiming at some sort of analogue to Delphi 4 held by many to be one of the cleanest and neatest in the Delphi line. It complied to just about everything its implementation of Object Pascal was spot-on and most importantly it was free in all the senses that matter to open source. However it has had a long history of bugginess and incomplete implementations of its controls. And this was bit of a deal breaker for me and many others. With that said I recently decided to download it out of curiosity and found that it's actually come a hell of a long way. The database components just work although you might need to follow a few tutorials and chase some leads around to get them all up and running and serious progress has been made towards iPhone and Android build targets.  I'm not sure I'm ready to deploy this to any of my commercial clients yet but I'm going to give it another run with a personal project to put it through its paces and if it does work I think I'm finally going to be re-united with my first programming love Pascal and in a matter that lets me use my Mac to do the heavy lifting whilst providing Windows and Linux builds.  So basically here are the facts on the comparison;-Lazarus and Delphi are totally separate entities. Lazarus is NOT a cross compiler for Delphi but has a certain degree of compatibility. Its more like GCC vs MS C++. Delphi is more polished and likely more stable.Lazarus provides a Delphi 4 like environment that old-hand Delphi coders will find very comfortable.but Lazarus can be temperamental at times and Delphi programmers need to understand that not everything in the latest and greatest Delphis will be there for them.Delphi does Windows and it does it very well (yes I know the new one has some cross compilation targets but word on the street is that it's a bit hacky and needs some time in the embacardo cooker before it's really there) whilst Lazarus complies to almost everything. The current target list is;- Darwin NetBSD OpenBSD FreeBSD Linux Solaris Win32 Win64 WinCE go32v2 (I think that's MS-DOS with 32bit extensions!) OS2 Netware(!) BEOS Haiku(?!) QNX wdosx(?) emx netwlibc Atari Amiga Palm-os Gameboy advance nds MacOS Morphos Plus there's experimental support for IOS and Android. On top of this the thing can use widget sets from  QT GTK GTK2 Win32/WIn64 Carbon fpGUI(no idea) Cocoa or no GUI at all with various degrees of implementation transparency.  Its an exhaustive list!  So Caveat Emptor. I strongly recommend Delphi coders download this and do some personal projects to get a feel for it not on the boss' dime but there's a lot of depth and substance to Lazarus and it's potentially a vital tool in the belt for dealing with life outside the Windows crib. Plus since Delphi's new masters still haven't learned a !@#$%^&amp;* thing about why Delphi fell from grace (Hint make it affordable or free to hobbyists and students to learn and create custom components)  it's really the only budget option available. If Embarcadero ever wake up maybe that will change. Until then viva Lazarus. The two main reasons for me are 1) Multiplatforms support (Linux Mac OS X Windows)  2) The price $0 Maybe I'm just reading this wrong but you seem to be under the impression that the IDEs are somehow interchangeable.  That's not correct.  Lazarus is built on top of the FPC compiler and is tied to it in much the same way that Delphi is tied to the DCC compiler.  Also they use different form description file formats.  Delphi can't read LFMs and Lazarus can try to read DFMs but it doesn't do a particularly good job of it. FPC/Lazarus is very similar to Delphi but it's a different dialect of Object Pascal and it would be a mistake to think they're equivalent. Lazarus is cross-platform and free both as in speech and beer while Delphi is neither. Lazarus does use a  is a powerful one click installation package for cross platform native Delphi like RAD/IDE based on Lazarus/FreePascal that eliminates painful cross platform setup. You can start coding just few minutes after the download so if cross platform 64 bits or price are key benefits for you then choose Lazarus over Delphi. Lazarus is highly compatible to Delphi and I have converted few applications without much problems. It is possible to maintain code that compiles on both. I don't have that much new to add but I thought I'd relate my crossplatform experience. As far as putting together a cross platform application sketch fairly quickly I find Lazarus to work very nicely. I've recently been using MonoDevelop of which there is much to commend but the gui designer stetic doesn't seem as complete as the Lazarus GUI designer. Or is it the toolkit (GTK#) that seems to lack some bits? Before that I've used Qt / C++ which also seemed to work out fairly well for crossplatform development but I'm not real keen on C++ and Qt's signal/slot framework is a bit curious but works well once you get your head wrapped around it. In sum I find RAD work and coding using Lazarus to be mostly joyful besides what a cool name for an IDE! Cheers
112,c++ - Run .exe outside IDE but use break points inside IDE ,"Using VS .NET 2003. Would like to run the .exe from outside the IDE (i.e. command prompt or double clicking .exe icon in windows) However still want break points to hit in the IDE. How do I set this up?(Running from outside IDE but IDE seeing it as run from ""Debug"" -&gt; ""Start"") Thanks.On the Debug menu choose the ""Attach to process"" option to attach a debugger to your externally-running application. Visual Studio enables Just In Time Debugging by default.  If you haven't turned it off you can call DebugBreak() and you will get a popup allowing you to attach a debugger.  If you don't attach a debugger then the program will exit so you could try wrapping the DebugBreak call in a MessageBox or some other conditional code based on an environment variable or config item. Since it is C the call to DebugBreak() is correct - this will give you a nasty error dialog (different look depending on the OS) which should have a 'Debug' option. If you click this you should get a dialog to select one of the installed debuggers (VS.NET shoud be among them). Selecting it should bring you to the DebugBreak() line. However this can fail if the debugger can not find the pdb files for your app - in that case you will just get the disassembly view and no source code view. You can also use WinDBG and the 'Open executable option' - again it will need the pdb files to yield anything useful.  "

115,simulation - IDE for GPSS language ,GPSS stands for . And it looks like that the language is more dead than alive (I didn't find good and actual blog or web site). I began studying this language a few weeks ago and faced with the lack of good IDE. I have to work with GPSS World and a don't like this system. Does anyone know if there is any IDE or IDE-like system to work with GPSS? My dream is about intellisense good run-time debugger etc. P.S. Sorry but i can't create a new tag 'gpss'. Thanks.FastForward to 2016: I have used Wolverine's GPSS\H professional and student version.  There are several variations of GPSS and there are many other non-GPSS alternatives.     AGPSS has a GPSS has IDE.  A Toolbox GPSS-version exists for MATLAB (subset of commands).   GPSS's (Wolverine version) strength lies in that is computationally very efficient (lean) because it precedes Win-Tel \ DOS.  The successor to GPSS\H is Wolverine's SLX and both are considered to be at the forefront of speed and capability.  The student versions are available for download and evaluation Ok It's time to answer and finally close the question. As I told to  there are some companies in Russia but I didn't see their result.  However I found the one solution - . But I do not know if the development is in progress or the project already died. You can figure it out by yourself. As to me I would choose AnyLogic instead of GPSS. Thanks. I'm studing in UBA. We are using SNAKE in the Simulation course.

120,Python IDE for teaching? ,I am a student in a year 11 Computer Science class. Previously having taught only Visual Basic my teacher is looking for a language and IDE to teach the class with that is cross-platform and is easy to learn so I suggested Python to him for the language. However he would also like to teach with an IDE with it that includes a form builder in addition to the typical functions of an IDE (editor project management code completion debugging etc.). Having only ever developed with a text editor (usually ) and a relevant compiler I know next to nothing about IDEs and what would be good to use. I've also realised that Python has bindings for a multitude of graphical toolkits of which one is probably chosen for use 'behind-the-scenes' in each IDE's form builder so that is certainly another thing to consider. Could anyone suggest a free open source IDE for Python that would fit my class' needs and would be able to run on Windows Mac OS X and Linux-based operating systems at least? For those who recommend that plain console programming is the best start for beginners I agree! If I were the teacher I'd direct my students straight over to the Python console that is already installed on the computers and start teaching some programming not tainted by the issues of GUI programming. However I would still like to find an IDE for him in case he says that he has to follow the curriculum strictly and needs to teach GUI programming with an IDE/form builder.PyDev is a Python IDE for Eclipse  which may be used in Python Jython  and IronPython development.emacskate - linuxeclipse

Topstyle 4 is the only one I've com e across with HTML5 (and CSS3) support. Its early stages but it works enough for the most part. Since HTML5 is still in the works and doesn't have consistant support across any browsers yet my guess is that it's going to be quite a while before you get a WYSIWYG HTML5 Editor. In the mean time get used to editting your markup by hand in a good text editor like  has nice support for HTML5.

The latest Netbeans edition compatible with my Mac is NetBeans 7. However in my class we use NetBeans IDE 8.0.2 Am I able to transfer projects between both versions (via thumb drive) and edit them on both versions of Netbeans? Thanks for the Help!You can try it but I have had trouble in the past with some custom Ant extensions Netbeans uses breaking when you try to use an older version of Netbeans than the one the project was created with. The other way seems to be less problematic.  I have almost always been able to open projects created with an older version of Netbeans with a newer one. I think there are two options: copy the source folder(netbeansprojects[Your project]\src) and copy it to a thumb drive. Open a new project in your pc (the one in your class 8.0.2) and go to THAT projects src delete it and replace it with the one from you're flash drive.

129,text editor - Multiple Language IDE ,I've been using Notepad++ for years and although it is comfortable I am feeling the need to move up into the IDE world for various reasons which I'll outline below. I am looking for IDE recommendations for someone who works in multiple languages on a daily basis - I am currently looking at Eclipse and Netbeans but willing to consider any option. The reason I have not made the switch to a full-fledged IDE yet is because they feel so bloated they are slow to load and eat up a ton of memory. Recently I have been working on an astronomical number of projects (5-6 at work upwards of 10 personally) in a variety of languages (Python PHP Ruby Java Javascript xHTML CSS TorqueScript to name a few). These are just the languages I am using on a daily basis - although I don't expect to find an IDE that will meet all the demands of these languages (especially the more obscure TorqueScript on the list). So what would you recommend for someone who needs a fast configurable IDE that offers support for a variety of languages syntax highlighting (preferably with various color schemes) project organization/browsing Intellisense-ish code completion? I forgot to mention I am primarily targetting the Windows environment here - when I'm on my Xubuntu machine (minimally) Geany works fine for what I need to accomplish.I would recommend Eclipse as the closest match for the multi-language requirements. There are IDEs that possibly shine better for a given language (e.g. I prefer IntelliJ for Java) but none that have such a broad coverage of multiple languages. As far as memory/bloat it's a price you pay for the convenience that an IDE provides. The  covers a whole pool of languages and above all that you get a free VM with root access. Definitely worth checking out.
130,How do I edit the Visual Studio templates for new C# class/interface? ,"I find myself removing the following import statements in nearly every C# file I create in Visual Studio: Of course its really easy to do this with Resharper but I really should not have to. There must be a few template (class interface) somewhere in the VS directory from which I can remove the offending lines. Where do I find these files? Is there a better way to control the default import list?Extract edit and recompress. Paths are for the class template but the interface templates are in the same folder. You may want to edit the VS template file in each to remove the fact that they don't automatically add references to the assemblies System System.Data and/or System.Xml. . For Visual Studio 2012 to remove these from the default class.cs file the item template could look like this (do not include/remove using statements): Default Class Template file:C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplates\CSharp\Code\1033\Class\Class.cs More info here:  New class templates might be located in different folders depending on the project type as well. While working in a Web Project in VS 2015 I found that when editing the file  that I was able to create a new class with the default format that I wanted. Old question - new answer:Sorry for the maybe offending question: Why would you care about it at all. Productivity Power Tools (visual studio extension i would recommend using it anyway) -&gt; enable the option / setting called: ""Remove and Sort Usings on save""  No extra click / keyboard shortcuts / manual template modification etc ... since you have to save your files anyways. Just want to add to the excellent answer from Sam Harwell. There might be more than one class template for instance  has its own template at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual  Studio\2019\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplates\AspNetCore\Code\1033\Class\Class.cs"

This includes frameworks libraries header files whatever as well as compilers debuggers and various other tools such as profilers etc. An IDE simply makes access to those more user-friendly (or > hence the name) if you will. However Eclipse for example comes with its own compiler as well. In any case an IDE allows you to develop applications from a single environment be that Emacs Visual Studio or Eclipse. If you only have an SDK you'd write programs with a text editor compile them with the compiler (instead of hitting 
133,Jump into interface implementation in Eclipse IDE ,You know how in Eclipse pressing Here's what I do: The procedure isn't very quick but it gives you a good overview. Well... well... I hope you use Eclipse Helios because what you asked is available on Helios. Put your text cursor again on the method and click menu Navigate → Open Implementation. Now if you have more than one implementation of the method you will get choice to pick which implementation to open.

135,xml - IDE for XSLT stylesheets ,What is the best IDE for creating and debugging complex XSLT stylesheets?  For debugging the ability to set breakpoints and step through the source would be great. I am interested in all options both commercial and free.Editors worth checking out: All have their specific advantages so just check them out. If you already have Visual Studio I'd suggest you just getting started with this one. I use Visual Studio. It lets you set breakpoints (conditional or otherwise) and establish watches on whatever XPath expression you can come up with. It also supports XSLT right out the box and colours it differently than regular XML so developing in it is very easy. My recommendation is XMLSpy but isn't free - . Hope this helps.

138,python - JavaScript IDE? ,This is a super basic question I am just unfamiliar with the definitions to some of the terminology. I am using a mac and i'm looking for a IDE(I assume it is an IDE as that is what I use for python) so I can write in JavaScript for study offline and see my results. I have searched google downloaded Aptana Studio 3 and a few other suggestions also I have the latest version of Xcode. Maybe I am just overthinking this or it is my lack of experience but I can not seem to figure  out how to write JavaScript or other specific languages inside one IDE. Sorry if this seems like too straight forward to answer but i'd really like to find an IDE for OSX that is free writes at least html5 css and JavaScript. Yes I have googled that and how to begin writing JavaScript on a mac. Thanks a bunch!an IDE stands for Integrated Development Enviroment so a program that helps you write programs is an IDE an IDE for javascript could be any text editor write your code as regular text save it with .js as extension and add a reference to that file from an html page. I think you can use these free IDE's on mac: Sublime Text and Aptana Studio  I'm sure there's alot more just google it
139,php - Problems with laravel-ide-helper ,I am going through the Laravel 5 Fundamentals Laracasts video set but am having some difficulties with Facades in my IDE (Phpstorm 8). I have a model which uses the Eloquent facade  method is highlighted and flagged as Method 'findOrFail' not found in class App\Article. I am new to Laravel and the concept of Facades but am lost and have been unable to find an existing answer for my problem.Have you tried ? If you have problems during generation you could also just copy the pre-generated gist: Source:  As far as findOrFail goes I've had luck using class CLASSNAME extends \Eloquent instead of class CLASSNAME extends Model within your Model. This workaround will cause it to use the helper file so I believe you will need to deploy WITH the ide-helper file but I'm not certain. That will get most of them working it seems however I'm still having issues getting where to work within my Model not sure if it has to do with how I'm calling it $query-&gt;where(... but using \Eloquent seems to fix most of the methods.

141,Best IDE for Perl 5 ,"I have a good experience with Bash shell scripting and am now moving to Perl. What is the best IDE for Perl 5? Will Perl 6 kill Perl 5? Or will Perl 5 always be alive?""Best"" is of course a matter of taste. Rather than ""best"" I'll answer this as ""what editor should I use for Perl if I don't already have a strong preference for an editor?"" I went on a short quest to answer this question for my students. What I recommend now is . This is the editor available on any Unix machine and you'll need to use it when you inevitably find yourself needing to edit files on a Unix machine. It is very powerful but also very baffling. Atom has rendered the rest of this answer obsolete. ). I don't know of any of my clients using Perl6 and given this and the extant documentation for Perl5 I would reach for Perl5 with little fear of being overtaken in the near future. You can check EPIC plugin for Eclipse. Far from having all features but you can do some debug and use Eclipse feature quite easily. You can go safely with Perl 5. Perl 6 is a new language still being worked on and its date of release is unknown so you shouldn't care about it for now."

It supports various assemblers and compilers.
143,Good IDE for HTML ,"I recently started to learn HTML from Code Academy. I have searched around a bit but I have not been able to find a good IDE that closely resembles the one used in the Code Academy course. If anyone has any suggestions please tell me. I'm just looking for an IDE that resembles the one used in the Code Academy course.Most devs I know use Sublime Text me personally I use a variety of tools depending on what I'm working on. Which are good however are as always with this type of question subject to opinion. What's good for me may not suit you where as something I hate may be the perfect tool for you. One bit of advice I will give you though learn to code raw before you go looking for an editor that has all the bells and whistles and does stuff for you. If your just starting out and your learning HTML one of the worst things IMHO that you can do is to use an editor that writes the code for you. I've trained a LOT of developers over the years and by far the ones that always performed the worst where the ones that used automated tools early in their training. If you learn to write code using a very minimalist editor then you'll quickly grow to understand what your writing better rather than thinking ""oh my editor will do this for me and I can look it up later"" For me personally I have no problems logging into a Linux server at the command line and using something like midnight commander to live edit web pages in real time on a live web site :-) If I want the bells and whistles and I'm on windows then Visual Studio is often my tool of choice if I'm on Linux at a desktop then often Net beans. Every application has it's pros and cons the best way to find your perfect tool is to just try a few and see how you feel it's like buying a new pair of shoes unless you try them you'll never know if their going to fit or not. For HTML and such I really like Sublime Text ("
144,VHDL language IDE ,  can anybody tell me IDE where i can write VHDL codes? both have IDES available for free download. At least as of a few years ago when I was using it regularly the Xilinx software didn't handle updates well at all -- to the point that if you decide to use it I'd recommend installing it in a virtual machine and if you ever decide to update it do a clean install into a fresh VM image. Your simulator software should have a primitive ID. Xilinx Altera Cadence ModelSim all have primitive VHDL and Verilog IDEs. Actually most HDL developers I've worked with don't use the IDEs except for non-HDL related tasks like top-level schematic capture routing and analysis.  On the teams I've worked on Notepadd++ was popular as well as Vi and Emacs.  I never had a license for it but one partner company used Visual SlickEdit for all of its editing.  It seemed like a nice tool. We used Cadence when I was doing my EE undergrad. No complaints (which is rare for university-provided software).

148,open source - Opensource/free HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript IDE? ,What is the best open source/free HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript IDE? Thank you!!!Most of the time when I write code I am programming C# applications using Visual Studio which is my favorite IDE. However when it comes to Javascript VS is quite poor. It does not support collapse to definitions (AKA code folding in other IDEs / editors) does not support code outlining and also has a very primitive and most of the times useless autocomplete. Because of that at some point I have started to search alternative tools for JS programming and the best I came across was . It also has support for HTML and CSS (as well as for some server side languages like Ruby PHP Phyton) but I have only used it for JS and that is an area where it shines. It has very good code outlining and one of the best autocomplete implementations I have ever seen for Javascript (even thought it is still improvable). Aptana Studio is based Eclipse and is available as a plugin or as a full package version. On their site they are saying that the next version is going to totally independent from Eclipse which would make it a lot more light weight and more performant. However the current Beta version of Aptana Studio 3 is still based on Eclipse. You can find more on Aptana Studio 3 on the official page: .This also may help: an extensive  after few years with Aptana... I enjoy using it.
149,What is the best IDE for PHP? ,I'm a PHP developer and now I use  and several others but I'm not really decided they all look nice enough but a bit complicated. I'm sure it'll all get easy once I get used to it but I don't want to waste my time. This is what I'm looking for:Are you sure you're looking for an IDE?  The features you're describing along with the impression of being too complicated that you got from e.g. Aptana suggest that perhaps all you really want is a good editor with syntax highlighting and integration with some common workflow tools.  For this there are tons of options. I've used .He says it here:  would be my second choice. My only problem with Komodo is that the autocomplete is not as good. With properly structured apps where you use phpDoc to document return types etc. it should be alright. But I work on a project that doesn't really do that and Komodo can't read across files to know that $user is a User object for example. Personally everything that is based uppon Eclipse or NetBeans is an overkill the GUI is crap and the performance is soooo slow compared to other alternatives. If you're willing to pay I would suggest Zend IDE (version 5.5 not 6 because it's based on Eclipse) and EditPlus for a more lightweight yet powerfull code editor. If you're looking for free alternatives or if you code in other languages other than PHP OpenKomodo is a really nice IDE with almost all the features (no SVN neither CVS) that you require the only con I see about OpenKomodo is that sometimes it messes my code indentation but then again I don't use it on a very regular basis. As for a free lightweight alternative: Notepad++. =) My personal preference is Eclipse (with various plug-ins) as I am developing in several languages (PHP Java and Ruby) and this way I am always used to interface and keyboard shortcuts. This is not a minor thing as you become very productive this way. I haven't used Aptana but will (hopefully) soon - it does look interesting though.For others IDEs I have used: jEdit (for little Java) Notepad++ (still for some scripting and short test code runs).And for the features You asked: Eclipse support many source code version servers ( is as close to Eclipse java power as it could get. Eclipse PDT is much weaker (last time I checked). I'm using PHPDesigner but I will go for Eclipse PDT. I was always against Eclipse until few months ago when I have one Java project to finish... Great IDE Now I can't imagine one day without Eclipse. :) Have you tried NetBeans 6? Zend Studio and NetBeans 6 are the best IDEs with PHP support you'll come across and NetBeans is free.

151,IDE for C++ developers ,"What is the most popular IDE for C++? And library for windows?What is about QT?The best IDE for c++ is visual studio(if you are working in windows) but if you want to use Qt QtCreator is also nice. but i can't get what do you mean ""A library for windows""!"
152,c++ - How to configure CLion IDE for Qt Framework? ,"How to configure CLion IDE for Qt Framework?Is this IDE compatible with Qt or are there other IDEs compatible with Qt? I just want to try to use something else than Qt Creator.I was as desperate as you until I read .It worked perfectly for me! To summarize there are 2 main steps: Firstly CLion uses CMake to compile your code. It is based on CMake configuration files (e.g ""CMakeLists.txt""). You have to add Qt based CMake commands (the lines with 'find_package' and 'target_link_libraries'): Secondly CLion has to use the  binary installed by Qt. For that go to:'Preferences' -&gt; 'Build Execution Deployment' -&gt; 'CMake' and in 'CMake options' append the CMake path that Qt uses which should be in the directory where Qt is installed. For instance on OSX: You can test that everything is working fine by doing a little test script in  and adding in the last line: You can do this with all the other Qt5 modules. This approach is one of the simplest way to be used for the newest >: CMakeLists.txt: Resource files (.qrc) should be added to add_executable list inorder for moc to be able to run its procedure on the resource and theinternal file like qmls texts ... be accessible. qml files should be included in a qrc file and load using > you used a beautifier like ""Uncrustify"" to auto beautify the code on saving a source file then: As Tom Lank mentions Qt projects can now be managed with and built under CMake which makes CLion happy. . One thing that isn't mentioned in the Qt CMake manual or above is that you'll also need the lines: All of these calls to  file as a project in CLion.Most likely you'll need to tell CMake where to find your Qt packages with a line like this before your 's: Finally if you're running on / building for windows Qt no longer comes pre-built with GCC/Mingw32 libraries. You need to build with visual studio. Luckily  and I've found it to work for Qt projects; just be sure to set the architecture (under Settings-&gt;Build Execution Development-&gt;CMake) to x86_amd64 in order to build in 64-bit mode and be compatible with Qt's pre-build libs. All of this is tested with CLion 2017.1 Qt 5.9 and the Visual Studio 2015 compiler. You can build QT applications in CLion. QT Provides CMake modules that take care of all details.  The following CMake script builds the example application '). You can easily develop Qt with VC Eclipse CLion etc. when you use CMake as a build tool. CMake will generate the project files for each IDE. I was using several IDEs this way. After this journey I am an even happier user of Qt Creator.  The only thing you need is to add QT install  to your PATH. Don't forget to restart PC afterwards because CLion for some reason isn't able to refresh the path only full pc restart helps. "

I'm only a novice Python programmer and all I can piece together is that Atom-IDE is built from Nuclide but they both seem to have similar features and language support.Atom IDE contains a subset of Nuclide’s functionality.

157,objective c - Apple iOS IDE for linux? ,"I am interested in getting to know whether there is an IDE to develop for Apple iOS? I am currently learning Objective-C but I don't have a Macbook or something like that. So actually I am looking for an ""all around"" IDE including: What else would I need to develop iPhone apps on Ubuntu (if that's possible)? Thank you for any suggestions.What you are asking for is neigh impossible. The only solution I could think of to develop on Linux would be to use GCC or Clang to compile Objective-C. There are no Apple Frameworks or simulators save GnuStep and that isn't 100% compatible. There are a few problems.  The iOS SDK libraries don't exist for Linux.  The simulator does not exist for Linux.  How do you plan to sign your app from Linux? You could technically use a VM but that is against the Mac OS X EULA. Another sketchy option is to compile against GNUStep and test on a jailbroken device.  Honestly your best bet is to break the bank and get a Mac (Mini or Air now that the MacBook is discontinued. That said you might consider spending a bit more on a larger screen. It's really hard to write code on just 11 inches of screen.) A few moths of developing may make back your initial investment.  Good luck! While probably not producing native looking apps there are a couple cross-platform multimedia  tool-stacks like the  for info on this. Basically running a virtual machine with an OSX image is likely to be the best approach if you'd like to distribute your app through the Apple store."
158,git coding with IDE ,I'm new to Git. Before using Git I used Subversion for my web project. One thing I'm wondering is how to code on an IDE when working with GIT. As for SVN only one version of code is locally stored on your computer so we just have to open and edit that version directly before committing it to the remote repo. However for Git we have multiples revisions stored locally so I don't know how to work using an IDE. Must the IDE support Git? Currently I'm only managing to code using an integrated editor in Terminal which is not very convenient.I don't understand how the IDE is relevant. You just commit whenever you want as normal and then when you want to push to a remote repository you do so. It's a bonus if the IDE supports Git of course as then you don't need to switch between a console and the IDE but it certainly doesn't > to. The IDE should ignore Git's repository just as it would have to ignore the .svn directories for Subversion. Certainly working with Visual Studio - even without any plugins - has given me no Git-related problems. A lot of major IDEs have some support for Git. It usually comes from a plugin not from the core functionality of the IDE. At the very least the git integration of your IDE should allow you to commit and push to the remote repo. It may also work on earlier commits etc. Your mileage may vary depending on your language of choice what IDE you're using and your platform. All of this is just a wrapper for system commands so there's nothing that you won't be able to do it might just not be convenient. I agree with Jon -- the IDE is irrelevant. You'd just work normally. If you point the IDE to the right directory it'll show the code and let you work on it. With git you have the master branch to which you usually commit your changes. There is no difference to SVN cause in SVN you usually commit to the trunk. If you are working with branches you will change to the branch either with SVN or with Git and do your commits there. That's it. One of the differences between Git and SVN in this use case is you have the whole history availabe while working with Git. As Jon has already mentioned the .git folder that contains all versions is hidden from the IDE. You always have one version checked out in your work directory which just contains ordinary source code. I work with Netbeans for which an plugin exists that supports some very basic features of GIT. It highlights lines that have been changed added or deleted compared to the previous version which is quite useful. For branching commiting and so on I use a terminal.
159,Is there any Gradle eclipse IDE integration? ,i'm looking for an eclipse ide integration for gradle. I've installed the gradle editor from But this is far away from what i expect from an ide integration. It provides only some syntax highlighting. No auto completion error mark task list etc. Is there any real ide integration for eclipse?The SpringSource Tool Suite includes Gradle support. See  for downloading STS. You can install STS into your Eclipse installation and Gradle support along with it if you don't want to start from the STS release. Looks like the STS team extracted the plugin into stand alone module for an introduction. 
160,php - PHPDoc type hinting for array of objects? ,"So in PHPDoc one can specify  doesn't seem to be valid for example. The best you can do is say I do that a lot in Zend Studio. Don't know about other editors but it ought to work. In the PhpStorm IDE from JetBrains you can use  is not necessary. . I prefer to read and write clean code - as outlined in ""Clean Code"" by Robert C. Martin.When following his credo you should not require the developer (as user of your API) to know the (internal) structure of your array.  The API user may ask: Is that an array with one dimension only? Are the objects spread around on all levels of a multi dimensional array? How many nested loops (foreach etc.) do i need to access all objects? What type of objects are ""stored"" in that array? As you outlined you want to use that array (which contains objects) as a one dimensional array.  As outlined by Nishi you can use: for that.  But again: be aware - this is not a standard docblock notation. This notation was introduced by some IDE producers.  Okay okay as a developer you know that ""[]"" is tied to an array in PHP. But what do a ""something[]"" mean in normal PHP context? ""[]"" means: create new element within ""something"". The new element could be everything. But what you want to express is: array of objects with the same type and it´s exact type. As you can see the IDE producer introduces a new context. A new context you had to learn. A new context other PHP developers had to learn (to understand your docblocks). Bad style (!). Because your array do have one dimension you maybe want to call that ""array of objects"" a ""list"". Be aware that ""list"" has a very special meaning in other programming languages. It would be mutch better to call it ""collection"" for example. Remember: you use a programming language that enables you all options of OOP.Use a class instead of an array and make your class traversable like an array. E.g.: Or if you want to store the internal objects on different levels within an multi dimensional array/object structure: This solution replaces your array by an object of type ""orderCollection"" but do not enable code completion within your IDE so far. Okay. Next step: Implement the methods that are introduced by the interface with docblocks - particular:  Do not forget to use type hinting for: This solution stops introducing a lot of: all over your code files (e.g. within loops) as Zahymaka confirmed with her/his answer. Your API user is not forced to introduce that docblocks to have code completion. To have @return on only one place reduces the redundancy (@var) as mutch as possible. Sprinkle ""docBlocks with @var"" would make your code worst readable. Finaly you are done. Looks hard to achive? Looks like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Not realy since you are familiar with that interfaces and with clean code. Remember: your source code is written once / read many. If code completion of your IDE do not work with this approach switch to a better one (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA PhpStorm Netbeans) or file a feature request on the issue tracker of your IDE producer. Thanks to Christian Weiss (from Germany) for being my trainer and for teaching me such a great stuff. PS: Meet me and him on XING.  Now usage of classes: Once again: I suspect not all IDE support it but PhpStorm does. Try yours post in comment the results! I know I'm late to the party but I've been working on this problem recently.  I hope someone sees this because the accepted answer although correct is > the best way you can do this.  Not in PHPStorm at least I haven't tested NetBeans though. The best way involves extending the ArrayIterator class rather than using native array types.  This allows you to type hint at a class-level rather than at an instance-level meaning you only have to PHPDoc once not throughout your code (which is not only messy and violates DRY but can also be problematic when it comes to refactoring - PHPStorm has a habit of missing PHPDoc when refactoring) See code below: The key here is the PHPDoc  to signify ""an array of Foo's"" but it's not supported by IDE's. I've found something which is working it can save lives !"
161,macos - Good C IDE for Mac? ,"I've just started a job where I'm programming in C on a Mac which is my first experience using a Mac for development. For now I'm using Xcode as my editor then using make/gcc/svn at the command line for compiling and source control. Is there a good full featured IDE out there for Macs that will compile C code (something comparable to VS would be ideal) or should I stick with these low level tools? EDIT: so I called Xcode a ""low level tool"" because I was under the impression that it was just a text editor for code like gvim. I will definitely look into it's compiling/source control features.You can also try  Xcode can manage project and compile for you as any IDE. But if you're familiar with CLI I would recommand you to use a good editor and your usual build tools. Emacs and vim are available on os x (using xcode just for its editor is not ideal). Many mac dev love the excellent TextMate editor but it is not a free (as in freedom) software. Obviously 'good' is a subjective decision but Xcode 3.2 is certainly up to par with what you can do in VisualStudio (if one considers VS good is another thing of course).   I have a project with 250000+ lines of codes 10 dylibs helpfile all in an SVN (Perforce) etc. and hardly ever go outside Xcode. Xcode has a few peculiar ways to do some things and the debugger is not quite as powerful as the current one in VisualStudio but overall there's hardly anything you can not do from within the IDE (and the options to adjust the shortcuts within the IDE Debugger and Editor to your needs are really awesome).

162,php - Popping the IDE cherry ,Although I've been a developer for years I've never used a PHP IDE - I've always just used a decent editor. What am I missing? I generally code on local servers so I can debug as if my code were running on my own machine I have code highlighting I have shortcuts set up to look up function names and so on. Is it worth investing the time in learning to use a full IDE? Is it worth investing the money in purchasing one? Looking at (the slightly aging)  I would probably go for PhpDesigner or possibly Eclipse.Consider  is a veteran in the IDE field. It's not free but it's not expensive either - yet. Has a long trial period and you can use it afterwards - it just closes every half an hour but that's it. phped from nusphere. We prefer it over zend). Regards rbo i've been using nuSphere netbeans and eclipse for a while and of these three i find netbeans the most usefull. it doesn't hang as often as eclipse does and it has a lot of shortcuts for project browsing. i find myself browsing the projects a lot faster using netbeans than the other 2 and it has a lot of features you most likely won't use but you can disable them so they won't eat up resources. I tried PHPed and nusphere debugger and it works really good too. I prefer PHPed instead NetBeans is lightweight you can encode your php scripts for distribution nusphere has php express too an extension to execute php scripts encoded with nucoder inside PHPEd.

167,c++ - Suggestion for C IDE? ,I used  to use gcc compiler on my unix machine. I am now forced to work on a windows machine. Is there any cool IDE or a simple editor for C with a unix terminal like feel ( on it :)) What other editors/IDE are as robust as gcc for windows? Also what is your personal favorite. I would like a try a few of the those before I stick with one. Thanks.If you are used to a Unix-y feel and are looking for a text editor I'd honestly avoid installing Visual Studio. It's a nice IDE but it is very heavyweight and perhaps much more than you are asking for. That said you might of course find that you like it but be aware that you are potentially looking at a several-hundred-megabytes download 2 gigs for the full package IIRC. Netbeans is good too but fairly heavy and a little difficult to get set up correctly with C and C++ at least last time I tried. It's a good alternative to VS though. I'd go for a more lightweight solution like Notepad++ vim for Windows or my personal favourite Geany -  - cross platform free IDE designed for GNU toolchain. Visual Studio 2010 has an express edition that's doanloadable for free. .  Personally I tend to use both. I heavily lean towards Visual Studio 2010 but occasionally compile using gcc to make sure that both compilers are working the same way. This used to be beneficial in the past (pre VS2010) but I haven't had much success in catching VS2010 make mistakes - yet.  In terms of the overall experience of integrated development debugging etc. it's hard to beat VS2010.  Net beansCode blockDev c++code lite are good IDE

169,java - Things possible in IntelliJ that aren't possible in Eclipse? ,"I have heard from people who have switched either way and who swear by the one or the other. Being a huge Eclipse fan but having not had the time to try out IntelliJ I am interested in hearing from IntelliJ users who are ""ex-Eclipsians"" some specific things that you can do with IntelliJ that you can not do with Eclipse. .CTRL-click that brings you to where clicked object is defined works everywhere - not only in Java classes and variables in Java code but in Spring configuration (you can click on class name or property or bean name) in Hibernate (you can click on property name or class or included resource) you can navigate within one click from Java class to where it is used as Spring or Hibernate bean; clicking on included JSP or JSTL tag also works ctrl-click on JavaScript variable or function brings you to the place it is defined or shows a menu if there are more than one place including other .js files and JS code in HTML or JSP files. Autocomplete in HSQL expressions in Hibernate configuration (including class property and DB column names) in Spring configuration and it will show you list of those beans which you can inject into that property.  Very smart autocomplete in Java code: and it shows you ONLY > functions in your project. Did I mention autocomplete and ctrl-clicking in paths to files like &lt;script src="""" &lt;img src="""" etc? Autocomplete in HTML tag attributes. Autocomplete in style attribute of HTML tags both attribute names and values. Autocomplete in class attributes as well.Type &lt;div class=""&lt;CTRL-SPACE&gt; and it will show you list of CSS classes defined in your project. Pick one ctrl-click on it and you will be redirected to where it is defined. Latest version has language injection so you can declare that you custom JSTL tag usually contains JavaScript and it will highlight JavaScript inside it. You can use Find Usages of any Java class or method and it will find where it is used including not only Java classes but Hibernate Spring JSP and other places. Rename Method refactoring renames method not only in Java classes but anywhere including comments (it can not be sure if string in comments is really method name so it will ask). And it will find only your method even if there are methods of another class with same name.Good source control integration (does SVN support changelists? IDEA support them for every source control) ability to create a patch with your changes so you can send your changes to other team member without committing them. When I look at >.Ctrl-click on >  Whether it is debugging refactoring auto-completion..

My experiences are based on Community Edition which does data flow analysis fairly well. It has failed (refused to do anything) in few cases when code is very complex. First of all I love intellij.  There are at least a hundred features it has that eclipse lack.  I'm talking magnitudes better in reliability and intelligence that no hyperbole can describe when it comes to refactoring renaming moving and others which have already been mentioned. BUT there is one thing that intellij does not allow which eclipse does.  It does not allow running multiple projects at once under the same vm.   When you have separate projects for the front middle core agents..etc where they all have to interact with each other you can not quickly modify and debug at the same time afaik. The only way I current cope with this is to use ant scripts to deploy and update jars in dependent projects or use maven.  Eclipse allows multiple projects to be debugged under one ide vm instance.

The only IDE i've used before is eclipse so maybe I'm not thinking of an IDE the right way but I'm expecting something kind of like eclipse.(>) I think our installation instructions are quite clear but I repeat them here for you again: If you are new to Python or the Scientific Python ecosystem we  recommend you to install and use . It comes with Spyder and all its dependencies along with the most important Python scientific libraries (i.e. Numpy Pandas Matplotlib IPython etc) in a single easy to use environment. After installing Anaconda you need to open the Anaconda Navigator (using Spotlight) and run Spyder from there. Another option is to open  but you should really remove what you installed with it and use Anaconda instead. As we said in our installation instructions too: We also support pip but please be aware that pip installations are for advanced users with good knowledge of all Spyder dependencies. This clearly seems to be not your case.

I really need know which one have the best performance during  development and testing the features that any IDE can bring me. any answer will be wellcome. Excuse my english Mexican Boy!PHPStorm is the best in my opinion (however NetBeans also works good with Magento probably Eclipse and ZendStudio work good. but have no experience with them). PHPStorm But PHPStorm becomes really powerful IDE for Magento with the help of  Magicento is a free PHPStorm plugin for Magento developers. Features include:Goto for factories and template paths autocomplete for factories xml files and class names documentation for xml nodes evaluation of PHP code inside Magento environment and much more to come!  if you develop module than this is right IDE
178,java - Files edited outside the ide ,"If I run a script to edit files outside of the ide I am using will the ide recognize the changes made to the files? More specifically:-IDE: Netbeans 6.8-Version Control: CVS-OS: Windows XPIn general yes. But the form designer of NetBeans considers some parts of the code ""private"" and you shouldn't modify these parts externally. They are identified by comments in the generated code: These parts are in fact generated from an external proprietary .form file and having the source code not aligned with the .form code will mess everything up. Yes it should. Give it a whirl and check it out. Yes with some caveats: If you have those files open edited and unsaved in the IDE at the time then you will need to tell the IDE whether to discard or keep your in-IDE changes. If you have them open and unedited then depending on the IDE you may have to tell it to reload those files (the IDE should warn you that the file has changed since you last opened it). If you move files around and your IDE has some kind of project file (that tells it among other things where all the files are) and you don't update it accordingly you may have problems. Any files that you don't already have open in your IDE should behave as expected and I would consider it a bug if it didn't pick up the changes."
179,"ide - How do I ""Add Existing Item"" an entire directory structure in Visual Studio? ","I have a free standing set of files not affiliated with any C# project at all that reside in a complicated nested directory structure. I want to add them in that format to a different directory in an ASP.NET web application I am working on; while retaining the same structure. So I copied the folder into the target location of my project and I tried to “add existing  item” only to lose the previous folder hierarchy. Usually I have re-created the directories by hand copied across on a one-to-one basis and then added existing items. There are simply too many directories/items in this case. So how do you add existing directories and files in Visual Studio 2008?Drag the files / folders from Windows Explorer into the Solution Explorer. It will add them all. Note this doesn't work if Visual Studio is in Administrator Mode because Windows Explorer is a User Mode process. Enable > This is what I do: Then everything will be added on your solution from folders to files and files inside those folders. A neat trick I discovered is that if you go to ""Add existing..."" you can drag the folder from the open dialog to your solution. I have my Visual Studio to open in Admin Mode automatically so this was a good workaround for me as I didn't want to have to undo that just to get this to work. There is now an open-source extension in the Marketplace that seems to do what the OP was asking for:  If it doesn't do exactly what you want the code is available so you can modify it to suit your scenario. HTH What worked for me was to drag the folder into Visual Studio then right click the folder and select ""Open Folder in File Explorer"". Then select all and drag them into the folder in Visual Studio. In Windows 7 you could do the following: Right click on your project and select ""Add-&gt;Existing Item"". In the dialog which appears browse to the root of the directory you want to add. In the upper right corner you have a search box. Type  whatever the type of files you want to add. After the search finishes select all files click Add and wait for a while... The cleanest way that I've found to do this is to create a new Class Library project in the target folder and redirect all of its build output elsewhere.  It still leaves a .csproj file sitting in that folder but it does let you see it in Visual Studio and pick which files to include in your project. It's annoying that Visual Studio doesn't support this natively but CMake could generate the Visual Studio project as a work around. Other than that just use Qt Creator. It can then export a Visual Studio project."
180,Development oriented PostgreSQL IDE ,Could someone recommend PostgreSQL IDE oriented on developers not on database architects or administrators. I.e. I look for an IDE that will increase my productivity in:1. Writing stored functions (code completion and syntax highlighting)2. Ctr+Click navigation between functions (or any other way)3. Finding All References (where certain function or table is used)4. Refactoring stored functions (renaming function or variable; extracting function etc.)5. Refactoring tables (if I change column name functions and views that uses that column should be also updated)6. Structuring my functions during the development into kind of folders (let them be finally flatten on the database)The project that I currently working on has hundreds of tables and more than thousand of functions. Currently I work with pgAdmin and my productivity is extremely low.All database development tools that I checked so far from () do NOT cover even 10% of what I expect from a modern IDE.I think the Toad plugin for Eclipse is going to be the closest thing you can find.  Unfortunately having a totally comprehensive IDE with these features is going to be a huge project in part because PostgreSQL can use stored procedures in so many different languages so syntax highlighting inside the stored procedure requires a vast amount of knowledge (in theory to be considered complete not only sql and plpgsql but also C C++ Java Python Perl TCL R Ruby Lisp various shells PHP Lolcode and Brainfuck -- there are probably more but those are the ones that come to my mind).  Consequently the only hope of doing this is to tie into another IDE. This being said I and most devs I know tend to use bash vim etc.   It is a fundamentally different paradigm but it is more flexible in many ways and the limitations you do run up against force you to design and test your SQL in sane ways.
181,android - Which IDE for Phonegap? Is Eclipse enough? ,"I am about to jump into Phonegap and realize that it doesn't have an IDE of its own. I know that I could use Eclipse to create Android-centric Phonegap apps but what about the iOS and perhaps Windows Phone and perhaps Blackberry ""versions"" - can Eclipse be used for all of it? What do most Phonegappers use as an IDE? Does PhoneGap Build make it possible to do it all in Eclipse and then throw it up to the cloud for the iOS etc. builds?I'm currently using   - a ZIP file of HTML CSS and  JavaScript or a single index.html file - to PhoneGap Build point us  to your Git or SVN repository.

In Eclipse I have Aptana plus web tools platform and of course the Android ADT plugins installed. I've got another guy who does builds/plugins for iOS using a Mac/Xcode/etc. We try to do as much debugging in browsers as we possibly can and just use the simulator/emulator (and devices) for testing plugins and other device-specific stuff. We're just moving to PhoneGap 3 and are evaluating PhoneGap build as an alternative. (We're particularly interested in the debug capabilities.  It's not clear how much they really add over what's already out there.) It certainly sounds good on paper but we'll have to see. If you're doing plugin development you'll need the appropriate system for development (PC or Mac) and testing."

I could try VIM but does the Haskell Mode works for Windows there? Sigh... All the time the 'close but no cigare' feeling. Is there actually so out there programming Haskell under Windows?I think the main IDE-ish options for Windows are in order: I use option 4.  .It has haskell syntax highlighting it only needs to switch on haskell tabulation mode (4 spaces instead of tab) in preferences but it is not a big deal.
183,oracle - IDE for Pl/SQL development ,"Is there any free IDE for Pl/SQL developmentI use  from Allround automation too. I kinda hate it dearly for all its bugs and that we paid a full year maintenance w/o seeing anything new in that period.But for some rather strange reason it still beats the hell out of all the other outrageously overprized and underfeatured tools for PL/SQL.And I am not talking about Oracle administration which it can do quite good as well thx to how fast one can script things in it.Its focus is PL/SQL not point &amp; click table creation. But than my Grand Ma could build a tool for managing tables users etc. A good code editor is not as easy. > One thing besides the countless little bugs that face every time is that it is completely ignorant to the fact that Oracle has an escape syntax for non-standard identifiers.You can't do much using its GUI with such objects but have to resort to the command window or  any other editor to script it yourself. btw the fact that I still use it and prefer over its alternatives doesn't reflect very well on  the market of commercial Oracle IDEs IMO.I think for writing DB code it is better than anything from any DBMS I have come across so far.It has very little GUI support for stuff but its different code editors are very capable and productive.  is a free PL/SQL IDE that is lightweight and fast and it's free.Although one feature it's missing is a debugger support. There's also the open source plugin for NetBeans named . It's currently (version 2.1) very rudimentary requires a live database to work on (no offline work with on-disk PL/SQL script sources) and I couldn't get the navigation (""Go To Declaration"") to work on my Oracle 10 application. I have been using Squirrel SQL for years and like it b/c it's database independent.  it does have some limitations but if I need something with more DBA tools I would also use SQL Developer."

185,c# - UML and favourite IDE ,I've just downloaded Visual Paradigm for UML and it looks quite ok. Does anyone have any experience with it? Or maybe someone has his own favourite IDE which is worth using and wouldn't mind sharing this knowledge? Do not want to use IDE which is written in JAVA or C# for patriotic reasons.I would recommend you Visual Paradigm. It is has very intuitive interface and it is easy to use. I use it at the moment. But if you want to try something else this page could be helpful . The best modeling tool for Eclipse is Omondo.  It is just magic but also  !!
186,Zend Framework IDE ,I am assigned to work on a project which is developed in Zend Framework 1. I just know PHP language and I am studying the Zend Framework. I want to setup the Zend Framework project in IDE. I googled and came across Zend Studio which is paid. Is there any other community edition IDE in which I can work on the ZF1 project smoothly and can someone provide a link for the tutorial to setup the project?I would recommend using Eclipse for PHP:  Zend Studio is built on Eclipse and having used both myself I can tell you they are very similar.  Once you have Eclipse up and running you can add the Zend Framework 1 library so that you will have auto-complete and framework documentation available in real time.

Im loving the lighter baggage and I can do everything I can do on my laptop expect for the most important thing develop. The main reason for this is because i cant find a decent ide that runs on Android so I'm putting the question out there. Is there and ide i can run on the Android platform?Directly on android? No I don't think so.   However it is possible to install ubuntu on a tablet.  Then you could use eclipse or any other linux IDE I suppose.  Heres a video showing you how to install ubuntu on a tablet.  supports the full edit-compile-run cycle for Android Apps and has a great editor. It works fine on my devices (Transformer Prime and Samsung Galaxy S2).
188,Go IDE With GUI Design Support ,I was taking a look on Go language but I want to know if there is any IDE developed only for it but that have a GUI design feature as Visual Studio and Netbeans.You can also find an Eclipse plugin here:  However at the moment of writing this is still at an early development stage. Go isn't really designed for GUIs - it's precisely designed to meet the kind of needs that Google has. I dare say it's entirely possible to develop GUI frameworks with/in it but it's not the team's priority as far as I'm aware. lite ide is little cross platform and open source.you can try it. editor. It's definitely  a Go GUI IDE but at least for me the gocode auto complete feature is great. You can also use Notepad++ for now there is a language file for it here: A programming environment by Rob Pike it is very different from a traditional IDE but if you are open-minded and get over the first shock it can be extremely pleasant to use. Use Cloud-IDE.com online editor and online deploy - All FREE !! I believe the best options for developing Go are TextWrangler Vim or BBedit.

I tried Komodo and Webstorm I just couldn't make them work or maybe I had not configured them correctly...but none give the possibility to set the same alias as in dojoConfig (too difficult?).For example in Webstorm there is a library concept I added dojo and my package but no way of course how it could without knowing the alias paths. There is also a Path Variables concept no way to understand how it works the documentation is so poor! Thank for any help.You might be looking for TernJS.   It is the best tool I know for the job. Tern is rather RAM-hungry though (compared to a pure text editor).Integration with Sublime Text is seamless and with other Sublime plugins you can bring it quite close to a definition of IDE. Below is an excerpt from TernJS documentation: Tern is a stand-alone code-analysis engine for JavaScript. It is  intended to be used with a code editor plugin to enhance the editor's  support for intelligent JavaScript editing. Features provided are: Tern is open-source (MIT license) written in JavaScript and capable  of running both on node.js and in the browser. Editor plugins There is currently Tern support for the following editors: It hasn't autocomplete and shortcuts are little bit difficult:) But very useful for me.  Well I am using PHPStorm 8.1 (Webstorm should be ok also) now and...I just declare my js packages as javascript libraries : Settings &gt; Languages &amp; Frameworks &gt; JavaScript &gt; Libraries &gt; Add... add and point to each of your packages'folder and enjoy :) Have to mention JetBrains IDE rocks give it a try sure you will adopt it since - at least - it resolves AMD style...
191,Enthought TraitsUI based Python IDE ,Has anybody come across an Enthought TraitsUI (Envisage etc) based Python IDE? I wonder why there is none when Enthought Tool Suite makes it so easy to create extensible python GUI applications. One reason I can think  of why such an IDE makes a lot of sense is because it will be cross platform. Any reason why such an IDE does not make sense?Any reason why such an IDE does not  make sense? Most people who use Python don't use the Enthought tool suite so there's not enough interest to create a project (or demand for a company to sell a product). I know that's not what you want to hear so here's a few options: You can always use Eclipse or another open-source IDE as a backend and just build a new UI. [Full disclosure: I work at Enthought] I agree with you the stack Traits + TraitsUI/pyface + Envisage makes a lot of sense to build a crossplatform IDE and is fairly simple. If you are interested in learning the stack and building one yourself there are several open source examples that you could use to get started: We have also been working ourselves using that stack as the backbone. The next version of EPD currently in beta will ship with that IDE (free) in the coming couple months.
192,Alternative SilkTest IDE ,"Coming from Eclipse there are many features that simply do not exist in the SilkTest IDE. My question is this: Is there an alternative IDE to SilkTest that I could use to maintain our SilkTest scripts? Something that can offer some of the power that Eclipse and many other mainstream IDEs bring to the table? Some of the power I'm referring to is: If the answer is ""No"" that's acceptable and is what I expect but I will wait for a short time to give others the opportunity to answer. Additionally we have the 2009 license of SilkTest. If these features are available in newer versions of the IDE that's also an acceptable answer. Thank you.For 4Test (SilkTest's classic scripting language) the answer is 'No'.  However for some time there are Silk4J and Silk4Net around which allow you to create your test scripts in either Eclipse or Visual Studio using Java or a .Net language. You can then use all the features the IDEs provide. Note:I work for Borland on the SilkTest team so my answers are probably biased."
193,javascript - TypeScript Web-Based IDE ,Given the fact that TypeScript is Open Source is  also available as a tool that can be downloaded anywhere? I'm developing a web application in which the client can write a user-defined expression (with user-defined variables and predefined methods) which is evaluated compiled and used at runtime on the server using C# .Net. Using TypeScript and its wonderful web-based editor's features like syntax or error highlighting code completion method signature suggestion etc  saves me lots of trouble in the user interface. So is this editor also part of TypeScript? If not is there any other open source solutions with similar capabilities?Update 2017: The . >Visual Studio Code is now open source which means we have access to the source of the Monaco Editor. I think this should now give us the ability to use the Monaco Editor in a browser I'm  there is goormIDE which is also cloud IDEthis is open source or service version  provides a VM with Root so you can install whatever tools you need and in this case TypeScript via .

That's because when you're trying to run the program it compiles the code first and puts the compiled result to the out location and then it tries to load the compiled code from the out location. If the compiled code is not in the location expected you'll get the error.  The point I'm particularly wanting to share is that some times the code is not compiled (built) even though your run configuration specifies ""Build"" in the ""Before launch"" section of the configuration panel.  When can this happen? One situation that can cause this to happen is if you're using modules and you manually delete the module out directory. For example if I have a module named ""foo"" there should be a directory named foo under out/production. If you manually delete it the build system may not know that it needs to be rebuilt.  Even worse if you select Build | Build module 'foo' it still may not rebuild the module. If that's the case you should select a file in the module for example 'bar.java' and then select Build | Recompile 'bar.java'. Now the out directory out/production/foo should be restored.  Since IntelliJ typically knows about any changes going on this surprised me and took me a little time to figure out so I thought I'd share.  I have faced such problems when the class is in the default folder i.e. when the class does not declare a package. So I guess using a package statement (eg. ) on top of the class should fix it. I had to mark the ""src"" folder as ""Sources"". After restarting IntelliJ and rebuilding the project I could run the project without further issues (see ).Edit: You can access the ""Project Structure"" tab via File-&gt;Project Structure or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S. Open Modules Tab (Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S). I had two modules under one project. I've solve the problem after removing the second redundant module (see screenshot). As others have noted you have to . IntelliJ could not find the main class even though everything was set up correctly.My solution: delete the  folder then restart IntelliJ. Follow these steps Yippee....your code will run:) For me the problem was a special character in the file path. IntelliJ allowed me to open the project however when I built/ran the project it couldn't locate the class any more because it was transforming the file path to remove the special character and therefore was looking in the wrong directory. To solve the problem I just removed the special character from the folder name my project was stored in and reopened the project in IntelliJ."

196,Adding PyMongo to Python IDE ,I am a python newbie - I want to use the pymongo library to access mongoDb using some convenient IDE and after looking through the web i decided to use WING.  Can some one point how to add the pymongo library to the WING ide (or to any other IDE for that matter)? i want to get the auto-completion for commands. ThanksWell you can consider using Sublime text. You can run your python programs straight from your editor. It has autocompletion (suggest a listing for what you might have meant to type in). Though it won't suggest function names as in Netbeans or eclipse. But still its a very elegant editor used by many. Also you can  If you are in windows platform just install the pymongo.exe file and it will install in python directory. Then you will be able to access it in any IDE such PyCharm by typing:   import pymongo
197,IDE for elasticsearch ,I was searching extensively for having an IDE for elasticsearch. But I am unable to find one. I know it is simple Restclient will do but in most of the rest client the body editor doesnt have automatic indention and all. I was thinking If there is no IDE I can make one so that other people can also benefit from it. To make it I need how to create an editor? Any tools are available which will do proper json formatting while typing. IF that is there I can start a github project and start making an IDE. I can also add keywords of elastic search and it will easy for developers. IF that kind of thing is already there please point me to it. I am unable to find out one.The best option I have disovered so far is the Atom plugin . Elastic does not endorse promote or provide support for this application but works.

199,debugging - JavaScript IDE/Compiler ,"Now I hope some of you people will understand what I'm asking. I'm new to programming. I got introduced to JavaScript on Codecademy.com I use labs.codecademy.com for my JavaScript writing but it's limited. What IDE/Compiler can I use that's pretty simplistic in terms of being new to programming. Where I'm not surrounded by buttons that I don't know how to use yet. Does this even exist? A simple IDE?I think these two editors/IDEs are simple and good for beginners: More ""complicated"" but good javascript support: This is very subjective but nevertheless have look at this editors and choose what suites best for you. I hope I could help you. Notepad?  JavaScript doesn't have a compiler really.  Though there are ways of shrinking the code that some people call ""compiling"" but it isn't ""compiling"" in the strictest sense of the word. If you are looking for something JavaScript specific give  a try.  The personal license is $50 and I'm sure that while it will do more than you need right now it will grow with you. There is a 30 day trial. I was researching this exact question for my daughter. Like you she started learning JavaScript on Codecademy. She loves it but she is frequently frustrated when she doesn't understand why a program doesn't work. So I researched IDEs and debuggers and I read that Visual Studio has a debugger that is easy to use. But after installing 4 different versions I had to jump through lots of hoops to create a JavaScript project in Visual Studio Express 2013 and then I couldn't debug it. After a while I gave up and installed Eclipse. I have used Eclipse before and it's very powerful. I was originally looking for alternatives because I felt using Eclipse for JavaScript is kind of like using an airplane when all you need is a bicycle :) There are many versions and packages of Eclipse. I think this one might be the simplest to install:(Helios is a version and this specific package is for JavaScript developers) I actually used the latest version (Kepler). Unfortunately it doesn't have a package for JavaScript so I used the Java package:and then added JSDT: Yes Eclipse can be intimidating for a beginner but the good thing about Eclipse is that it works on multiple platforms you can find support for pretty much any language and it's free :) If you are serious about programming I recommend you invest a little time in learning how to use Eclipse. Let me know if this helps or if you have more questions."
200,Cloud9 IDE and C Programming ,"How can I write a C program in the IDE cloud9? Whenever I start to write its showing errors I even tried to change the file extension to "".C"" but it doesn't work. Does the cloud9 IDE support C programming?Yes Cloud9 does support C and C++ programming Cloud9 has a varying level of support for different programming languages and frameworks. Cloud9's ACE editor currently supports highlighting for about 60 programming languages including C/C++. The list is growing and you can get the full list from the ""View -&gt; Syntax"" menu. The editor has extensive support for JavaScript with error highlighting and code completion. It also has live syntax error checks for CSS CoffeeScript PHP Python JSON and Lua. The run menu supports running Each project is a unix sandbox with the standard tools like bash make gcc vim java SDK or perl installed. The terminal in Cloud9 is a full xterm compatible terminal emulator and you can use this to compile and run your C programs. Cloud9 also has a package manager called  which currently has about 120 packages. These packages include e.g. different versions of python and ruby mono lua or groovy. In case you still need additional tools or libraries you can always download them to your workspace and compile and install them there. As you see it is hard to draw the line of what is actually supported but usually you will have at least syntax highlighting in the editor and running from the console. It claims support on the web page for ""Javascript and Node.js applications as well as HTML CSS PHP Java Ruby and 23 other languages"". Yet it's > to turn you off the idea just stating that (based on my experience) it doesn't seem as good as a substantial number of other solutions. Cloud 9 does support C ( and C++ ) using gcc and g++ gcc --version (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-4) You can use their integrated editor but the run button still acts like it trying to execute Javascript which is the default and seems to be their the target audience. They have a fine C hello world example --  Typically I just maximize the terminal and run vim ( they have 7.2 installed ) and it works just like any passable unix terminal.  They also have gdb installed if you need a debugger. There are comparisons against installed compiler solutions but that isn't what Cloud9 is competing against.  Their own description is Google Docs for code and that seems to pretty fairly accurate.  It certainly isn't all things to all people but it is a pretty amazing service. With Cloud9 I can write code on my Chromebook without having to install a bunch of stuff to almost make Linux run on it.  This would be a good solution for students since it would allow them to work in a computer lab without needing any software installed.  I have found that using github and c9 I can easily switch back and forth between c9 while I am remote and a local setup when I am on a real computer."
201,C++ IDE with repl? ,I'm looking for a good C++ IDE with a REPL. The one in visual studio isn't... well lets say most of the time if I copy/paste a line in source the REPL rejects it even if its the line I put a breakpoint or step over. Are there any good IDEs or REPLs for C++?Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter built on the top of LLVM and Clang libraries. Its advantages over the standard interpreters are that it has command line prompt and uses just-in-time (JIT) compiler for compilation. Many of the developers (e.g. Mono in their project called CSharpRepl) of such kind of software applications name them interactive compilers. One of Cling's main goals is to provide contemporary high-performance alternative of the current C++ interpreter in the ROOT project - CINT. The backward-compatibility with CINT is major priority during the development.  CLing should be independant of Clang and abble to compile on any platform recent works of CERN tend to separate Cling from Clang and it's good trends. What I don't under is mostly the existence of Clipp in C++ allowing to parse javascript embedded in my C++ code and can't find a version of Clipp for just C++ / Boost / Eigen / Quantlib. Another thing I don't understand is why TinyCC with a 200ko size is abble to parse windows.h without a problem and LLVM team complaining about Clang on windows.H detonate on tarmac. All in all with fusion spirit wave and the so many people wishing for a C++ REPL why after 2 decade there is not even small version of it. Here is my solutions Forget about REPL C++ and stick to REPL C use tinyCC and expose only the functionnal action of method by using pointer function A.function(toto t) -&gt; function(A * toto t). To make it works with object method you can also use declaration as struct __declspec(novtable) A { }; This will allow binary align compatibility between tinyCC struct understanding and your true object. True you will have to split the tuple of data and the tuple of method but after all that should have always be the case in first place. Object design should have split data and method into a dual model rather than a mixed model good for bug. In many case the compiler will split the object into dual model anyway. This will provide extrem fast prototyping even for scientist and user of Cling/Cint. Second solution rather than REPL statement use the dynamic load/unload pair you setup a chain of compilation ( incremental build or not ) and auto relink compiled library when the source change. It isn't slow at all. This give the advantage to do it on any supported dynamic library OS and it's very EASY to do. Third solution the most easiest way boot a linux based vm ( install llvm tool chain) and use Cling on the vm. That won't work in a firm full windowOSed but it seems LLVM are windows OS haters.

204,Which Python IDE ,  Hi recently started looking at Python basically for scripting so far I've been doing exercises from the web which is OK. I'm using gEdit and its fine. but I'm curious to know what is a good IDE for python that will still allow me to discover. One of the things I'm used to in Visual Studio is code completioncode snippets and tips so when you type FOO then CTRL+SPACE you get to see what methodsproperties etc are available for FOO. You can select a method press F1 and get HELP on its usage. Really helps discovery and learning.

208,C++ IDE that autogenerates cmakelists.txt ,I'm looking for an IDE that automatically generates a cmake file from the project. Ideally I would like the project to be independent of the IDE. I am mainly working under linux but Windows is a major (and great) OS so ideally it would run on Windows as well. I'm not too bothered about that though as on Windows there is VS :). Regards EDIT: Yeah I sort of see my mistake. I should have asked for an IDE that generates makefiles instead of cmake files since the cmake layer/step becomes useless (if the IDE can directly generate a makefile).The purpose of CMake is to generate the  file by hand - and KDevelop helpfully updates the GUI appropriately to reflect my changes.
209,c# - IDE Support for WinForms ,Hey guys I'm a newbie and I just wanted to know of the people who do Winforms on Visual studio at your place of work do your forms have IDE support. Because for some reason I don't have IDE support on 99% of the windows forms I'm working with. I mean I can not see anything on the design view except for errors is this the usual case in industry????Sorry WinForms is not broken for us (me). Check your code. Sometimes WinForms applications that were developed under Visual Sudio 2003 (or earlier) when upgraded to Visual Studio 2005 (or later) become unstable. Start with a new form and if the IDE (it is called a visual designer) works fine then think about re-creating the old forms from scratch with the newest VS installation. Are you using any 3rd party UI controls? Some have dll's for the design view to work and if you haven't installed the toolkit on your developer machine you might get errors like this.  One possible explanation for having errors on forms is licensing. If your company uses third-party controls on their forms they could cause errors when trying to display the forms on unlicensed machines. Another possible explanation for errors with third-party controls is simply installation. If you don't have the controls installed and referenced properly that could also cause errors. You could try to post some of the errors you have to another Stack Overflow question and perhaps the community could help you solve your errors.  Your question isn't clear! if the Visual Studio Designer not working well then re-install the IDE Or explain more... You should be able to view the forms in the design view. Always unless there is an error in code. In case the project is building you should get the same error (this is a runtime error) that you will generally get when you run the code.

The virtualenv works fine in the terminal but Ninja-IDE doesn't recognize the packages in it and throws an import error. How can I access the packages in the virtualenv in Ninja-IDE? Thanks!One quick answer so that others may find it useful. I had a very similar problem a little while ago and had a lot of trouble finding a quick workable solution anywhere not even google. I somehow figured out that the solution was to simply create a virtualenv folder with the version of numpy I wanted and then pointed the ""virtualenv"" property for NinjaIDE project to that folder. I restarted NinjaIDE and boom instantly worked. To set the virtualenv property for your project via the GUI go to the Project menu: and you should see a variable called ""Virtualenv Folder"". Point that to the folder for your virtualenv and it should work. (May need to restart NinjaIDE.)  This worked for me NinjaIDE version 2.2 under Ubuntu 12.04.

222,Difference between a IDE and text editor? ,"What's the true difference between an IDE and text editor with a bunch of plugins? Why should I prefer an IDE over a text editor for development?IDE stands for ""Integrated development environment"" not just a tool where you write the code but you can also compile it and debug it.. text editors in their nature usually don't do that they tend to go for a broader approach..be able to edit all types of files instead of specializing in a particular type or language.. sure you can have plugins specific for a type of file or language that compiles/runs/debugs but since is it done by plugins I guess the ""integrated"" part is of of the table so doesn't make much sense to cal it IDE and as said before because the nature of the text editors the potential for integrated development experience will always be limited In the end you want something that's going to make you the most productive. Whether that's Notepad or Vim or Sublime or something else is up to the user and the tasks required at the time. With that said an IDE does bring some solid benefits for development. Depending on the language and IDE this may include integrated build tools source control management unit testing tools automatic boilerplate generation and class/variable refactoring.  ""IDE"" isn't a very well defined term but in my experience single unit IDEs (as opposed to editor + added plugins) seem to have more powerful debuggers more integration between different tools in the IDE (e.g. easy to debug unit tests use of deep code analysis to feed autocompletion etc).  And of course more things work out of the box w/o having to download and configure plugins yourself and the GUI is often are easier to figure out for new users or novices.  But it's a personal choice and the bottom line is you should try the tools you're considering and choose the one that fits best with your needs. IDE is stands for ""Integrated Developement Environment"" where the programmer can develop efficient projects and it provides drag and drop facility which reduces the stress of a programmer. Editor is one which is related to a specific language where you an write the program and run the program.."
223,javascript - PHP IDE with design view ,I am looking for a PHP IDE to work with that contains a design view like ASP .NET where i can add button tables menus automatically. So is there an IDE like that for PHP? Eclipse for PHP Developers does contain this exact thing - because it's a java desktop client though it is pretty 'clunky' but give it a whirl!  Edit -- Just realised you essentially want a drag and drop interface - You actually want a html editor with drag and drop functionality as PHP itself is just server side scripting there's a bit of a difference between ASP.NET (as it's a framework) and PHP which is an actual scripting language. PHP generally just renders HTML elements - in which case you're actually looking for a drag and drop HTML interface. I'm loathed to say it but the only one I'm aware of that's reliable (ish!) is Dreamweaver. The closest you can get to .NET/VB ide is having an editor with html widgets  also has some mode or add-on for html widgets. Now you need to be aware  > ... real men code their ui by hand.

224,eclipse - Help in writing a IDE ,"I m embarking on a difficult journey to create/replace a IDE for one of the middleware products from Bigblue. Thy have created a IDE based on eclipse and Its a PIA to use it and very very slow even on decent configuration machine. Problem is there is no alternative to this.But i m planning to create one.So to start off i need to write a GUI in C++. I m planning to use Qt for this.But i need to understand how eclipse generate aritifacts and such. There are some graphical elements in Eclipse IDE used by bigblue. I need to create exacltly those graphical elements in my IDE. So its basically writing a eclipse IDE only in C++  but for the middle ware product only. Any guidance  suggestions are most welcome.  I know i might fail in this endeavor but I would rather try and fail than just to complain about how slow the IDE is. Thanks all. Edit : I have been using the Eclipse IDE for 5 years provided by bigblue and its dead slow I have to use their version because it has customized environment for middleware tool.I m finally tired of it.:(Eclipse by itself isn't slow and Java is fairly fast so I have to think you would win by simply doing a better Eclipse plugin. If you don't believe me or if I'm wrong then I have to think the back-up plan is to write a plugin for a different IDE. Even VS has third-party plug-ins. You can try to optimize your running environment. Buy more RAM!  A development machine for Eclipse should have 4 GB RAM. Working with less is a waste of time. Optimize your Eclipse JVM parameters - lots of articles on that subject. I found that Eclipse works more smoothly on Mac OS X and Linux boxes than on Windows. My guess is that it is probably due to the superior memory management of Unix based OSs. Personally I often find myself running 2-3 instances of Eclipse on OS X and they are all running just fine. Do not judge the entire Eclipse ecosystem by your experience with a single IDE based on it. The Eclipse platform is not slow in itself and modern JVMs are pretty efficient (although a little memory hungry). If the IDE you are forced to use is slow and badly designed it is probably due to that particular IDE and not because of Eclipse itself. I have quite a few years of experience designing and implementing IDEs and I can tell you that if you embark on writing your own IDE you will need at least 3-4 people just to keep it up with the feature set found in Eclipse/Visual Studio/etc. If you write it only for your own use you will find that you get very little time over to do real work. Eclipse is a wonderful ""platform"" for developing our own IDE.  That way you don't need to worry too much about the mundane things and you can focus on what sets your IDE apart.  A good place to start is the   The only practical way to approach the problem as described in the OP is to write your IDE features as an extension to an existing IDE framework. For a full-featured IDE you'll probably be starting with one of the following: If you write your own IDE from scratch you'll spend all your time working on the core IDE and end up with a product not nearly as good as one based on an existing IDE. Use a profiler to guide your work and you'll find the extension plenty fast enough."

226,jquery - Animation IDE for Javascript ,I was working on some animations today and it appears there is no straightforward Animation IDE for Javascript.  Having a robust IDE for Javascript Animation is crucial to eased development of advanced JS Animations.  With the web evolving you would think that a company like Oracle would develop such a solution.   Does anyone know of any quick and easy methods to Javascript Animation similar to the Flash IDE. Please refer to any applications on the OpenSource Market. Many of our Animation projects could be eased with such a JS Animation IDE tool.Adobe did that. Look at  and click on the second video. The current flash editor (apparently) supports creating HTML5 projects that don't depend on flash at all but are backed up instead by HTML5 canvas/svg and Javascript.
227,ide-haskell for atom editor isn't working ,I'm trying to use the  package for atom but for some reason it's not working. First I have ghc-mod and stylish haskell installed in sandboxes under  etc. I'm also currently running linux not Mac so I had to add some keymappings: These register just fine and are visible in the ide-haskell's package settings. However issuing the keystroke doesn't do anything (It used to open a file and save-as respectively). Where am I most likely to have screwed up? I installed ide-haskell > finishing the ghc-mod installation but that shouldn't really matter... the links are correct. If anyone could help with this I would be ecstatic :)You need to create a cabal project in the directory you're working in. Just run cabal init and answer the questions. Then open atom in the current directory. The Haskell IDE menu should appear. I know this is old but I want to mention that if you are using  to run atom within your configured Haskell environment. That works great for me on Windows.
228,Alternative IDE for Stata ,I am used to R-studio for R which has some features such as guessing what function you are trying to type by pressing There is no full-blown IDE for Stata. The question comes up pretty often at Stata User Group meetings and StataCorp developers always say that they work in text editors. See  -- there's plentiful customization for syntax highlighting in every major text editor but that's as far as you would get I am afraid. HTHStasK P.S. Now that I thought about it a bit more it is possible to send your code from a text editor into Stata. There are some hints to that in the document I linked to and it floated up on Statalist a bunch of times. I just was not paying close enough attention as I simply  whenever I make major changes. P.P.S. (Aug 2016) I use WinEdt and it has a Stata mod that can send do-files to execute in Stata. Still that's no IDE in the sense that you don't see objects variables macros etc. You can use Sublime Text to highlight Stata code. I'm not sure how to run code from Sublime in Stata using ctrl+d.  For highlighting follow this: Download:  from: to do this in Linux though). I think this is the closest one can get to an IDE environment for Stata at least for the time being.

230,Delphi XE6 - IDE File Open button shuts down the IDE ,"Odd behaviour for an IDE choose File Open from the main file menu or press the file Open button on the toolbar and the IDE shuts down. Select ""Exit"" on the File menu to shut down the IDE and it produces the File Open Dialog. It seems unlikely that this is intentional behaviour or have the programmers gone mad? Update: It looks like when XE6 is first opened the buttons behave properly then reverse when a new vcl application is created. The machine is Dell latitude Win7 32 bit laptop. I have installed XE6 on my Win7 64 bit desktop machine and it appears to function correctly.This can be caused by extra files being added to the IDE's Bin folder. In my case it was the FastMM dlls.  I found the answer on the Embarcardero Forums: Per Remy's answer The IDE's copy protection is being invoked at startup. If unauthorized  non-Embarcadero files are placed in the IDE's \bin folder the  actions of the file menu's  Open and Exit items are swapped. You need  to find the offending files in the \bin folder and remove them. The poster there has the issue in XE5 I experienced the issue in Delphi 10.1 Berlin. With probability close to 1 this is due to one of the design time packages that you have installed in your IDE. Remove these packages one by one until the IDE returns to its normal behaviour. At that point you will have identified the faulty package and can dig deeper to understand why it breaks your IDE.   It seems that people other than you are facing the same issue. It is possible that they have installed the same third party components as you that are defective. And of course it is possible that this is in fact a Delphi IDE defect. "

232,What is superior customization and changes you do it in visual studio IDE and other IDE ,Programmer using IDE more than else and mean to him a lot. But some time we need to customize it and change preference.   What is superior customization and changes you do it in visual studio IDE and other IDE? an addin that lets you use vi key bindings in Visual Studio. You'd be surprised how much time this saves! Most supiror for me is changing apperence for IDE Background and font color and font type Usually i reorganize toolbars position and i try to get as much space as i can for code window. with a purple background and a white foreground.
233,C++ IDE on Linux ,We trying to choose an IDE for C++ development on Linux.The proposed options are KDevelop and Eclipse. Eclipse is highly customizable but Java centric and heavy.KDevelop is bounded to particular KDE (I believe because KDE API) and can not be replaced if required. What you use and why? ThanksDimaKDevelop because: Since you are comparing KDevelop with Eclipse let me also point out that: Also when I've used KDevelop I've been using it on Ubuntu which uses the Gnome desktop. On Gnome KDevelop still beats Eclipse in terms of startup time and is definitely worth using. Also one last note if you use CMake with KDevelop then you can distribute your source code to users on Windows Mac and Linux and they will be able to compile your source code even if they don't have KDevelop; CMake can generate a native Makefile a Visual Studio project an Xcode project or a KDevelop project. So the concern that you can't replace KDevelop really doesn't apply if you use the CMake backend. I use  works well as an IDE on linux given that it can be set up with integrated build and debugging. Code Blocks is an option I think the correct answer is to try both (and maybe others) for yourself. Personally I've used Eclipse for the past ~3 years. I'm satisfied with it but there are parts that I think could be better.  But I think your best bet is to install both and try them each for a week or 2 (maybe longer). A lot of this comes to do personal preference and taste. This is the 2009 version of the vi or emacs question :) I use CDT on eclipse I find it very responsive. Plus plugins like Subclipse Mylyn etc really make development a lot easier. I use Java and C++ together is some projects so the fact I can code Java/JNI/CPP in the one IDE makes life a lot easier in my opinion. If you are looking for light IDE you can try vim. With appropriate plug-ins and skills it might be very powerful. QtCreatorEclipseNetbeansKDevelop Each has strengths and weaknesses and it'll depend a lot on on what else you're doing. You can also try  \M/

Is there anybody here who could at least give me an idea or a video perhaps on how to create a test script from Selenium IDE converting it into Selenium webdriver setting it up in the visual studio and successfully running it. Your help is highly appreciated.There are dozens and dozens of these videos already online. There is no point in using IDE. Go straight to webdriver. You must chose a language to write in first C#Java etc. If you don't know either of these it's best to study these first and then move on to Selenium webdriver. I suggest C#. You can use the Microsoft virtual academy to learn this from scratch.  Best of luck-Aaron

I have written programs and flashed into the microcontroller using the IDE. Now I want to use only the microcontroller and want to load the programs I have written using the IDE to it. There is a .htp file created to load the project once build is done and .elf created in the objects folder. But there seems to be no hex file created for me to load the program with other methods. I've searched the net on how to create a hex using this IDE. But didn't find any.  Has anybody used this IDE and know how to generate a hex file from it?Go to Project settings in Hitop IDE in the select the application of the project openedclick on the general box Check the create standard code box it will ask for intel hex or s format select intel hex option.Next time you build the project hex file will be generated.

StarPhP is a freeware editor for PHP  and HTML. This editor is specially  designed to be a lightweight and easy  to use application. It contains  features for both professional  programmers and beginners.  Notepad++ is a text editor and source code editor for Windows.Notepad++is definitely my favorite Notepad replacement because of the extensive features that it has built-in.I have used notepad++ and it give me a useful result. The main thing that makes Notepad++ fit well with the Firefox metaphor is the self-update check capability.  If you are thinking of trying emacs the following link would be helpful. It shows you how to setup php-mode and how to do syntax checking in emacs. I tried lots of IDE.

242,python - Vpython in Wing IDE ,"I am using Wing IDE and I have installed VIDLE with Vpython. VIDLE works fine but if I want to use it on Wing IDE somehow it can't import the visual module. It always gives an error ""No module named visual"". How can I import the visual module into the IDE? I thought maybe the problem lies in the version of the Vpython or the Python itself. The installed Vpython is for Python 2.7 (I've tried another one for 3.4 but the VIDLE wouldn't work with it). Both Python 2.7 and 3.4 are installed on the PC but I don't even know which one is taken as default on the IDE. So if this really has something to do with the version how can I change the Python path on Wing IDE? Sorry I am quite new in Python and I've looked everywhere but didn't come to any helpful answer. Thank you in advance."
243,Selenium IDE Basic Authentication ,"Im am using Firefox Plugin Selenium IDE for testing (not Webdriver or else). Some areas of my webapplication are only accessible after basic authentication: I found one soulution by myself: Firefox plugin AutoAuth. Typing login and password at first time using ""Save Password"" -function in Firefox the Plugin AutoAuth sends Login-Data automatically if authentication window appears next time. Note: AutoAuth-plugin can´t be used if the login-account has to be changed in context of Selenium-test. To switch users when the site is using basic auth you can specify the username and password in the URL you pass to the open command in the IDE. Viewing the source code in the IDE it could look like this if you want to be first ""user1"" then ""user2""."
244,3d - Real HLSL IDE/debugger ,Are there any IDE's for developing HLSL code?  The three key features I want are:1) syntax highlighting2) auto-complete3) interaction debugging Visual Studio doesn't do any of these things and it doesn't seem that RenderMonkey or FX Composer do either. Is there some IDE that I'm not aware of or does one of these three IDE's actually support these features and I'm too clueless to figure out how to use them properly?Have you actually tried ATI's RenderMoney or NVidia's FX Composer? Both actually provide syntax highlighting. Futher more NVidia's Cg toolkits actually allows you to enable syntaxhightling in Visual Studio with some custom setting. As for auto-completion I don't think it's much needed as compare to our normal programming. It's because you won't be writing a very long code for your shader programming. Shader is quite critical in that it is run on every frame generated and every instruction require 1 to a few clock cycle to execute thus there's always a physical limit to how long you can afford to write. Interactive debugging is currently the limitation of GPU hardware. To actually do that the GPU has to be emulated with our CPU which is quite impossible considering that the REF (software rendering) device can never cop up with even obsolete GPU what more to say about emulating shader.

247,IDE for debugging scons ,"I have a project which uses scons and swig. Which IDE I can use for debugging the code? I want to set breakpoints and use ""step over"" ""continue"" .... while watching variable. (Eclipse plugin) worked well for me in the past. Actually the  command you run to perform your build is a Python script -- you can replace it by a similar script within your IDE and launch that for debugging. Having said that -- actually I found the > of that kind of ""internal DSL"" is implemented in Python (which is surely an educational experience but not helpful for solving problems with my build). Thus usually I solve my problems just with adding some print statements to look into this and that variable in the current construction environment while the build script is evaluated. The manpage of SCons has extensive documentation about the various variables you can access in that environment object and in the dependency nodes defined when you add targets. Any Python debugger should be fine.  Visual Studio (trials available): Tobuy the latest Visual Studio google ""Buy Visual Studio"" (as the linkchanges) you can also google for a specific version. Many areavailable on Amazon. PyCharm home:  As an aside if you (or others on your team) want to > debug Django PyCharm Pro is definitely the best for that."
248,Java IDE with GlassFish ,Please recommend some JAVA IDEs comes with GlassFish server. I have tried both Eclipse and Netbeans both are not working consistently I am looking for an IDE to support GlassFish by default without any stressful confgurations. NetBeans 7.3.1 should work out-of-the-box. Are you downloading the Java EE distirbution that includes GlassFish?
249,External IDE for InterSystems Caché ,I want to replace the Caché Studio because it needs to be ran on Windows. Browser based IDE would be most convenient solution for using OS indepedently and mobile.There isn't a browser-based IDE available for Caché programming.  In fact the only alternative to Caché Studio is George James Software's  a commercial Visual Studio extension which allows you to work with ObjectScript code on the file system.  It allows you to export the classes from Cache and work with them as normal files on the file system. However this is for Windows-based systems only so I am not sure if it meets your needs. The XML > the actual source code.  Unfortunately there is no other option besides Studio but Intersystems is certainly working on one.
250,.net - VS 2010 IDE 2GB limit ,"I am using VS 2010 on a win 7 64 bit system with 8 GB of memory. My application is 32 bit. While in the VS 2010 .Net IDE the app shows up in the Windows task manager as ""MyApp.vshost.exe *32"" while the VS IDE itself shows up as ""devenv.exe *32"".  I checked and it appears that the VS 2010 IDE file (devenv.exe) is complied with the /LargeAddressAware flag.  However when debugging large models the IDE fails with an Out of memory exception. In the Windows Task manager the ""MyApp.vshost.exe *32"" process indicates about 1400 MB of memory usage (while the ""devenv.exe *32"" process is well under 500 MB). Is it possible to set the ""MyApp.vshost.exe *32"" process to be /LargeAddressAware in order to avoid this out of memory situation? If so how can this be done in the IDE. While setting the final application binary to be /LargeAddressAware would work I still need to be able to debug the app in the IDE with these type of large models. I should also note that my app has a deep object hierarchy with many collections that together required a lot of memory. However my issue is not related to trying to create say 1 large array that requires greater then 2 GB of memory etc. I should note that I am able to run the same app in the VB6 IDE and not get an out of memory situation as long as the VB6 IDE is made /LargeAddressAware. In the case of VB6 the IDE and the app being debugged are part of the same process (and not split into 2 as is the case with VS 2010.) The VB6 process can be larger then 3 GB without running into out of memory issues. Ultimately my objective is to have my app run completely in 64 bit to access more memory. I am hoping that in such cases the IDE will allow the debugging process to exceed 2 GB without crashing (and certainly more then 1.4 GB as is the current case). However for now while 95% of my app is 64 bit I am calling a legacy COM 32 bit DLL and as such my entire app is forced to still run in 32 bit mode until I replace that DLL.the IDE fails with an Out of memory exception No your program fails with that exception not the IDE.  You'd have to run editbin.exe in a post build event to set the flag: That will > work on the vshost.exe version you'll have to turn off the hosting process.  Project + Properties Debug tab. Some options I can think of: Disable the VSHost process - Do you actually require the  to forcibly set the flag in the .vshost.exe (no idea if that would work though!)"

252,Does RubyMine 2.0 earn its $99 as a Rails IDE? ,"I've seen a lot of blogs talk about RubyMine lately as a best of breed Rails IDE. Currently I am using NetBeans IDE for my Ruby and Rails stuff but I was wondering if anyone here would personally recommend this IDE and reasons why I should fork out $99 for it.I used NetBeans for a while before switching to RubyMine some month ago prior the first release.I can say the IDE is worth the entire price. RubyMine has the best autocomplete support I have ever seen. It's a really clever IDE it can understand most of the Rails ""magics"" including method references by symbols metaprogramming Rails/Ruby convention and so on. Also RubyMine 2.0 introduced i18n support for Rails and having to maintain a couple of Rails apps localized in 5 different languages I must say this is an awesome feature. It supports the latest testing frameworks in the Ruby ecosystem including Shoulda Test::Unit RSpec and Cucumber. Unfortunately it lacks RCov support while I know Netbeans is going to integrate it. A couple of co-workers are still using NetBeans and they often have problem with SVN because Netbeans doesn't auto-refresh the working copy when you update it outside the IDE.RubyMine has an excellent SCM support and ships with SVN CVS and even Git compatibility. I don't want this answer to seems like a RubyMine promo so I encourage you to give it a try for 30days then make a choice. I've tried Netbean RadRails and RubyMine. In my personal opinion it's well worth the money and I heartily agree with weppos. Your best bet it to try the evaluation version for a while and make your own mind up. I find IDE preferences are very subjective the only real way to know if it's any good is to try it for yourself. it is a little buggy and a big resource eater but has the better ""intellisense"" refactoring and complementary areas support (haml) i ever seen for ruby/rails. it's appearance under mac os x is lame and is much less usable (in terms of UI usability) than any other ide. i guess that in the next major versions it will become the ruby/rails killer-ide. i would wait to buy it as i see it as an immature project right now. Suffice to say that Rubymine (2.5 EAP version) is the first IDE I actually like. Having usedto excellence of developing Rails apps in OS X with TexMate when I switched the job and was forced to get along without OS X I was quite satisfied to find Rubymine. A veteran Emacs user (over 10 years) and recent Vim convert (gotta love the extremely powerful command system and short key bindings) I soon found that either the file navigation cucumber editing or refactoring support was quite lacking in those. With Rubymine I get TextMate-style file navigation which is just awesome the only IDE which actually has a type inferencing engine and is able to capture many run-time errors during the editing phase plus all the features I ever used in Rails projects. Yes I'm going to buy the software when they release 3.0 or so and I don't know if I'll use TextMate in the future when I get again access to OS X. They say the OS X support is very good in Rubymine EAP versions but what's nice that you can have that for every other OS as well. Apologies for answering in short. I'll add that debugging via RubyMine is very convenient. Just set a breakpoint and  try to hit the point.  You can see all of your vars set watches and investigate objects right in the debug console. I'd highly recommend it to any Ruby developer. To me there are 3 big advantages in RubyMine that other free or cheap editors/IDE's don't have (notably TextMate and Ruby VIM): I use it and as of right now don't think it's quite worth it - if you like working with a full IDE RadRails is as good (though in different ways) and free. I admit I haven't got all the keyboard shortcuts in RubyMine down so I'm not as productive with it as I hope to be but I find myself doing stuff at the command line more than I think should be necessary with a 'real' IDE. It's been pretty stable for me (on linux) the source control integration is good and it's not as slow as it used to be (though I still end up in vim at times if I don't want to load it). I'm hoping a 'plugin' ecology will develop around it. Overall it's a pretty good product but not (yet?) worth the $99 over RadRails (haven't used NetBeans) I've used Netbeans for a while(1+ year) now. and have tried RadRails too. but i choose RubyMine cause: all in all i think if you take some time to learn its key mappings you can be very productive with it. you wouldn't need to use a shell at all(well sometimes you might need to but...you get the idea). just my 2 cents I've been using Rubymine to develop Rails apps for a while now. There was a point a few months ago when I would have been hesitant to recommend paying for it.However the rate at which it has been improving and adding new features is really impressive.If you're doing BDD (with Cucumber) then it's worth buying just for the step completion and navigation. Also the features that have come from IntelliJ like Javascript HTML CSS VCS support etc are excellent.    I am a former NetBeans user.  I LOVE RubyMine!  It has excellent rvm git Rspec and cucumber integration all of which are in my stack.  Go with it.  You won't be sorry. I used both Redmine and Textmate but I tend to spend more time coding in textmate. It's a matter of preference whatever gets the job done quicker is the best tool in my opinion. Good Luck @johnrlive I love how ""project aware"" RubyMine is. Coming from ST2 (which is still use daily) it's hard not to miss the elegance of an editor like ST2 but working on large scale projects with versioning RubyMine is the IDE of choice for me. I just wish the would improve the editor and UI.  I just started to explore the IDE concept being a happy TextMate programmer until just a couple days ago. But now that I've played with both NetBeans and RubyMine I gotta say RubyMine rocks. NetBeans is cool for the price but it's slow slow slow. Sometimes windows will lock up for long periods of time while something is apparently ""thinking"" - of what I can't imagine. On the other hand even as a fairly novice Ruby programmer I was able to get RubyMine conversing with Git and AutoTest within a few minutes -- in short I got up and running and back to programming pretty quickly. On the flip side I still haven't figured out how to get it to work with Heroku or Growl but I'm still pretty new at it. I would say depends on what your looking for. Netbeans is definitely a very capable and sufficient IDE. Rubymine shines in its autocompletion and really easy Git integration. If you have a lot of money to spare I would say ruby mine is the way to go. However in my case as I am a broke college student Netbeans and/or text mate does the job fine. Spending an additional minute on git outside of netbeans and using my extra monitor for documentation has worked well for me thus far. "

The bash shell (and it's tools) + vim + cmake + mercurial = love. Bash is available on all popular platforms even windows p.s. I forgot gdb + ddd. The IDEs you named are all cross-platform and available on Windows Mac OS X and Linux. That said you only really need to make your code cross-platform (use . I love the autocompletion and call-tips features. They boosted my coding speed and productivity by 1000x. I know I sound like an ad but don't worry it's my most sincere opinion. If you want cross-platform development I agree with whoever mentions Qt. It's a really great reliable (depends on your requirements of course) and flexible cross-platform framework. Good luck! Have you considered Vim.   Not exactly an IDE but you could easily put versions on one USB stick to allow you to run anywhere.   For some things I like Eclipse but it is only portable in your sense if Java is installed on the host machine.   The other big problem with Eclipse is that it is fairly machine demanding and in my opinion requires a fast SMP machine to work well.    Frankly though I don't use Eclipse for any of the ""C"" languages right now.     A slightly tougher choice might be EMACS again using the same approach as with Vim.  That is putting multiple copies for your different target machines on a USB stick. In the end I have to second something else suggested that is the best portable IDE is a laptop.    For example you can have several very good IDEs installed on a Mac and easily transfer files to a target machine.  Being Unix it is fairly easy to install the GCC or LLVM of your choice even cross compilers.  The big problem with a USB dongle approach is that you never can be sure of having everything you need there.        Xemacs.  If you want something that you can keep on a flash drive with a ton of other tools.  It isn't full features but sure is a step up for writing software than vim.  "
257,terminology - confused with the IDE concept ,this question though has nothing to do with the programming stuff gets me bugged while I try to delve deeper a bit. I am confused with what this IDE means. somewhere it says its an editor or somewhere like its some PHP editor. I use dreamweaver normally and notepad ++ occasionally .. Is this what IDE is ? or is that I have misunderstood things.??An integrated development environment is generally a whole bunch of tools integrated into one. This includes editor compiler debugger and whatever other tools you may want to add. Back in pre-history we used to use an editor to edit the files then we would exit and use a compiler then a linker to produce the final product (actually when I first started we used punch cards and 80x25 data entry sheets and handed them to data entry operators for input into the computer but I don't want to bore the youngsters among you). Nowadays we just press the  key or if you use Emacs      
258,Best IDE for developing Java Desktop Applications ,I've been developing Java Web apps using Eclipse as the IDE. Planning to start developing a desktop app based on Java.  Can someone suggest the best IDE for developing Java based desktop apps? (One that would have drag drop for building the interface like Visual Studio)I recommend   Response to RTFM messages:I agree reading the manual is a good way to learn more about the tool. The OP is trying to figure out a few tools to learn more in depth and finally zero in on one (or a subset to meet varying requirements). To get to the first list before reading the accompanying manuals one would require some directions and help based on experience. If you had to read manuals of all related tools before identifying the tool that meets your requirement a new tool would have come in or your project would have gone past you! Response to original question on best IDE based editor: In some ways it doesn't matter which tool you use as long as you put the effort into learning it in depth. Know your tools! Read the Free Manual! In practice: you would want to pick Eclipse for SWT and Netbeans for Swing (Matisse is great when you are getting started). I haven't used IntelliJ but I am sure it is excellent. A couple of years ago I used Eclipse with  which I found very useful. I liked the code that it generated - it was really easy to take that and add the extra functionality I needed. if you aim for windows only than Visual studio is the best choice.For multiple platforms Mono is very good and it does not have java's .Of course you would use C# rather than Java if going with Mono or VS.
259,emacs - Which IDE are CLISP Programmers using? ,I noticed how SLIME (lisp development package for Emacs) does not come with a frame-source-location function for CLISP so you can't automagically jump to a source location when inside the debugger. Given that I figured CLISP users must be using some other IDE (though I guess IDE is a little bit misleading here maybe they're just using a different Emacs package). So what IDE/Emacs package are CLISP programmers using?I think Emacs and SLIME is still what those people use.
260,debugging - IronPython embedded IDE ,"I'd like to use embedded IronPython as a way of allowing users to script / extend my app. Running the scripts is easy enough but I also need to provide some sort of IDE or editor as well - this is the bit I'm not sure how to do. As far as I can see I have only a few options: The trouble with options 1. and 2. is that obviously they are a lot of work! (And will most likely be far inferior to ""real"" IDEs) - I was kind of hoping that someone else might have written an IronPython IDE that I could extend and embed in my app but I've had no such luck. Option 3. would be my preference - I'd imagine that I would save my script to a temporary file and then start the IDE with the path to my file as a parameter.  The problem is that in order to be able to test / run the scripts I need to set up some environmental objects beforehand - this makes testing and debugging the scripts from an external IDE rather cumbersome. I don't mind insisting that only certain IDEs are supported (i.e. Visual Studio) and so I was kind of thinking I could write out a custom MSBuild file that ensured that the environment was all set up correctly when someone pressed F5 but then I realised I was starting to be silly.  The other option I considered was if there were any open source IDEs that I could canibalise into embedded script editor. Or alternatively is there another soltion that I'm missing?The  is open source and it already has support for Python (but not IronPython AFAIK) so I imagine that might get you pretty close to what you want with some modifications.  Licensing is pretty liberal (LGPLv2 and MIT)."
261,debugging - Android Studio IDE: Break on Exception ,"It seems my Android Studio does not want to break on any exception by default. Enabling break on ""Any Exception"" starts breaking within actual JDE libraries. Is there any way to force it to break only on exceptions within my code only? Coming from Visual Studio universe looking for the default VS debug behavior here. and set it to this: Add to the exclusion list in the condition any other non-exceptional exceptions you encounter. (BTW using  is a way of effectively getting a second ""Any exception"" entry.)"
262,c++ - C++0x IDE support with g++ ,What IDE has a better support for the new C++0x features in g++? I know you can use the editor as is and compile the code using -std=c++0x but I would want the new features do not be marked as errors by the IDE (auto range-based loop variadic templates etc.).Here is  has had support for a while but I do not know to what extent.
263,Best IDE for Grails 1.1.X development ,I've been on a frustrating quest to find an IDE which provides reasonable support for Grails 1.1 development. My minimum requirements are: Here's a rundown of my experience so far Using the latest plugins available from the update site Eclipse's support for Groovy/Grails is truly pathetic. It provides little more than code completion and spurious errors As soon as I imported the project NetBeans began scanning it. The Navigator view was waiting for the scanning to finish before showing it's contents. About 20 minutes later both the Navigator view and I were still waiting. Also support for code completion on dynamic finders is poor and for some reason it copied all the plugins into $PROJECT_ROOT/web-app/plugins.  Although the general consensus is that IntelliJ is the best IDE for Groovy/Grails . The root cause of the problem appears to be the change in the location of the plugins folder. IntelliJ is unable to build the app because it can't find classes I'm importing from plugins even though those plugins are listed in application.properties So my question (finally) is whether anyone has found an IDE (not TextMate or Vim) that works with Grails 1.1.X when the plugin folder is in it's default location i.e. under $HOME/.grails/1.1.X/plugins? If so I'd be really grateful for information about: ThanksDonI'm unclear on which version of IntelliJ  IDEA the author of that blog post tested tha didn't work with Grails 1.1.1.   Idea 8.1.2 works very well for me on OSX with Grails 1.1 and 1.1.1.  Grails is installed under /Developer/grails-1.1.1 (with a symlink at /Developer/grails ) and the plugins are in the ~/.grails/1.1.1/plugins directory.    I didn't have to install any extra Idea plugins. What I did have to do was tell it where the plugins were and install the missing ones once I had upgraded to 1.1.1.  IDEA's grails integration can even recognize the plugins from the Grails repository and install them from the IDE. . The Spring Tools Suite is also an excellent choice for grails/groovy development. I use it and do not have any cause for regret. I've been using Netbeans 6.7 for some time and it's very slow the code completion rarely works. Basically I'm using it as an editor and to format my code. I used the EAP version of IDEA 8.1 and it was really nice - very easy to setup and develop in compared to the other IDEs.  Sorry I don't remember exactly how to import an existing project but it was fairly straight forward. If cost is not an issue then IDEA would probably be the best choice. I use STS (SpringSource Toolkit) I like it better than Intellij or Netbeans. I am using 2.3.3.M2
264,minify - Integrate Google closure compiler with Eclipse IDE? ,Does anybody know how to integrate  with Eclipse IDE? The thing I was trying to do is to configure Google closure compiler as a external tool for Eclipse IDE. Then I would be able to run closure compiler within IDE and minify my Javascript files with single click.Have anybody solved this problem yet?you could use ant tasks for this a Closure build tool. It dynamically recompiles JavaScript and Closure Template code. 
265,Glassfish IDE integration ,I am an Eclipse user.I am going to be using Glassfish on a project.Is the Glassfish IDE integration substantially better in NetBeans (or some other) or is the integration the same as Eclipse?with the full set of JavaEE plugins in Eclipse it's trivial to control/deploy to glassfish. Grab the JavaEE version of Eclipse and follow the wizard for creating a new enterprise application. Generally speaking unless you're debugging the only intergration you really need is: start stop deploy. You can make almost any IDE/script/buildfile do that. Stick with the IDE you're most productive in. I can't compare it to eclipse because I never tried it in eclipse but I can cast my vote for Netbeans integration. I've been using it for a while with Netbeans and I am very satisfied with the result. I stuck with Eclipse. Glassfish IDE integration is better with NetBeans.   The plugin for Eclipse isn't quite ready for primetime. My personal experience is that Eclipse with the Java EE extensions are more than sufficient for development and deployment of JAX-WS apps are faster in Eclipse than with Netbeans. The Glassfish plugin has forms for editing configuration for things as nuanced as WSIT WS-Security and WS-AtomicTransaction.  This speeds configuration.  However I've found that deploying a JAX-WS app performs ws-import more times than necessary which doubles deployment time.
266,c++ - IDE Font spacing problems ,I have been developing programs for a couple years now in Java and more recently C++.  Everything was going great until a couple months ago the font I was using in my editor suddenly got huge spaces between each letter making it almost unreadable.  For Java I used NetBeans IDE.  Now in my code I used the Papyrus font that I modified to be monospaced.  Gave my comments the hand written look while still being usable. A few months ago my comment spacing all of a sudden looked like it had a space between every character.  Figuring it was my fault when I modified the font I simply changed to a different font.  worked fine if a little less fun. Now as I am taking classes in C++ my instructor recommended Dev C++ IDE.  I know it is old but it is what I was told to use.  Now I am getting the same problem here only with all fonts.  Anyone know how to fix this? Screenshot: .This is what it Should look like:I had the same problem try changing your font family to

269,php - IDE issue or genuine error? ,My IDE (PHP Designer 8) flags (in red) the above function return line that gets the first value from the database however when I run it there are no errors thrown and it produces the expected results (see below). If I remove the [0] then the flag disappears.  Is this truly a syntax error or an IDE issue?  Looks like an IDE issue. It appears that the IDE does not recognize that results() is returning a list. I've noticed that IDEs will often flag this kind of syntax (when you are offsetting into an anonymous temporary variable). If you want to get rid of the warning try assigning the result to a local variable.
270,php - Lightweight IDE for Linux ,Even though I have a robust and fast computer (Pentium Dual Core 2.0 with 2Gb RAM) I'm always searching for lightweight software to have on it so it runs fast even when many apps are up and running simultaneously. On the last few weeks I've been migrating gradually to Linux and want to install a free lightweight yet useful IDE to program on C++ and PHP.  Syntax highlighting and code completion tips are must-haves. (or Emacs varying on religion) will always be my first answer to this question over any point-and-click IDE.As they write in  for Gtk/Gnome for KDE? Again it's a 'smart editor' rather than an IDE.  Seems to know how to handle most languages and once its started it is pretty smart still Java but less resource hungry than Netbeans and Eclipse. I would say ).
271,java - How to detect that code is running inside eclipse IDE ,"How to  detect that code is running inside eclipse IDEI am not aware of a generic way to get this kind of information. One suggestion: When you start a Java program (or a web server) inside Tomcat simply add an argument that will indicate that this program is launched by Eclipse. You can do that by opening the ""Open Run Dialog"" (""Run"" menu) then select your type of application and add in the ""Arguments"" tab a  dir whereas most of your end users will be running the app from a JAR. You may try something like this:"

273,editor/ide for node.js development ,Which IDE or Editor do you use for node.js Development on Windows or Linux? Currently I only know 2 IDE-Extensions: both are in a pretty early Development-Stage so I wondered are there  more Alternatives out there? Or is it common to use an Editor with Syntax-Highlighting for Node.js Development? from Jetbrains is very good and allows debugging with node.js. Every IDE which supports JavaScript highlighting will do the job. I personally use Sublime Text. While you work on node apps you have to monitor their output. I just place the console in my second monitor but if you use only one you may need to setup a build process.
274,"How to solve a RubyMine ""'ruby-debug-ide' isn't installed"" error ",I get the error: but all gems were successfuly installed: I can run 'rdebug-ide' manually: But when I start debugging RubyMine asks to install the ruby-debug-ide gem. Why? And after installation I get: I'm running Mac OS X 10.11.3.Here's the actual command that worked for me: I started getting this after upgrading from 2017.x to 2018.1. In my case it seems that RubyMine needed a newer version but its error message implied it couldn't find any version and failed to install it. I think it was trying to install it with a different SDK. Manually installing the latest  (global/default) it is using. Check out where these required gems are installed and make sure RubyMine is using that gemset where these are installed successfully. I fixed this after viewing the responses here:  The solution at the bottom suggested 'removing all my gems. removing ruby. cleaning up directories and rvm. removing ruby mine then reinstalling everything' I started with the easiest of these which was to reinstall rubymine. That solved it for me.  I have faced this issue too with Rubymine 8 rvm 1.29.1 and Ruby version 2.3.3 And upgrading the Rubymine version from Rubymine 8 to Rubymine 2016.3 or latest resolves the issue for me. Check ruby  version is same to which you have installed.With those all doneyou will be able to debug ruby. Please check x286 vs 64 version both Ruby and Rmine version. I had this problem runnin x86 rubyMine on 64 ruby A combination of matching the host ide ruby version with the remote SDK version worked for me but required a few additional steps.  I too am running mac os as my host (running mohave) NOTE: I had to re-install the bundler gem on both host and remote host to get the gem manager to install things auto-majically. NOTE: I also had to set the default RVM on my local host and remote host and unset the previous version as default in the local host preferences. Once I did this I was able to get gems in sync and remote debugger to connect. My solution was to go to Rubymine settings to the available SDKs remove the SDK restart Rubymine and add the SDK again. Since you're using Mac OSX I couldn't provide the same exact answer for you but you can find a similar way of achieving this. I'm using Ubuntu with Vagrant so you may need to adapt it just a little bit. It may asks you one more time to install the gem but then the debug will works for sure.

277,Click in OK button inside an Alert (Selenium IDE) ,I need to click the 'Ok' button inside an alert window with a  command. I've tried  but they don't do what I want. It's possible the click the 'Ok' button? If so can someone provide me an example of the Selenium IDE command?Try Selenium 2.0b1. It has different core than the first version. It should support popup dialogs according to : Selenium tries to conceal those dialogs from you (by replacing  window.alert window.confirm and window.prompt) so they won’t stop the  execution of your page. If you’re seeing an alert pop-up it’s  probably because it fired during the page load process which is  usually too early for us to protect the page. It is a known limitation of Selenium RC (and therefore Selenium IDE too) and one of the reasons why Selenium 2 (WebDriver) was developed. If you want to handle  to CANCEL it or  assertAlert ought to do the trick. I see in the docs that alerts generated in a page's OnLoad event handler cannot be scripted this way (and have experienced it myself alas due to the ASP.NET page lifecycle). Could that be what you're running into? For selenium an alert is the one which raised using javascript e.g. There is one basic check to verify whether your alert is actually a javascript alert or just a div-based box for displaying some message. If its a javascript alert you wont be able to see it on screen while running the selenium script. If you are able to see it then you need to get the locator of the ok button of the alert and use selenium.click(locator) to dismiss the alert. Can help you better if you can provide more context: Vamyip Use chooseOkOnNextConfirmation() to dismiss the alert and getAlert() to verify that it has been shown (and optionally grab its text for verification).   Problem with alert boxes (especially sweet-alerts is that they have a  delay and Selenium is pretty much too fast) An Option that worked for me is: The new Selenium IDE (released in 2019) has a much broader API and new documentation.  I believe this is the command you'll want to try:  Described at:  There are other alert-related API calls; just search that page for >

Is there anything that we could do to solve this ? P.S.: I really liked the splash screen from IntelliJ IDE (15) I want to create something like that as a splash screen. //----------------------------------------------------------------// If you want to scale it in relation to the monitor's resolution I'd first get the height and width with the : Then you can scale an image that you're using for your splashscreen by using this method: Then center it on the screen by calculating the middle and setting your component there: actual implementation is up to you but these are the tools I use and it works fine for me.  Hope this helps!
281,PhpStorm very slow and sluggish on netbook optimize IDE for responsiveness? ,"I recently upgraded from PhpStorm 6 to PhpStorm 7. Delighted to see all the improvements but it runs awfully slow on my low-powered netbook. The delay between typing and seeing text appear is often 5-6 seconds and gets worse as line count increases. It is unusable at this stage. How can I improve the general IDE speed and responsiveness?: I made some changes to increase the responsiveness of the IDE. I'm sure there are more things one could do but I found these to improve the performance to well within usable margins. From most effective to least: These changes brought down both the startup time and significantly increased responsiveness of the IDE in general. Add these to your  file at the bottom: Solid speedup to the point that the editor is now actually usable. I will for the life of me just never understand why people create editors in Java. If you need to speed up PhpStorm right away turn on Power Save mode. (File &gt; Power Save Mode or using ""Hector the Inspector"" icon  in the IDE status bar). This mode turns off on-the-fly code inspectionsThis way you can finish what you have started and later decide what code inspections to deactivate.   The most effective way to speed up new phpstorm version is an experimental feature that is going to be shipped by default in phpstorm 2017.1. Until that you can activate it on jetbrains products (webstorm phpstorm etc.)    Click on Add editor.zero.latency.typing=trueClose and open again the application.   For me the change typing is not laggy anymore.Other tricks didn't helped me or not in a noticeable way. Try removing unnecessary files from your project.I had 3k+ *.html log files inside my project and that slowed down typing terribly when the 'Project' tab was open. (Hiding the project tab or turning off the PHP Plugin does also speeds up PHPStorm but obviously those are not viable trade-offs.) (I'm using PHPStorm 2016)"
282,angular - Angular2 - how to start and with which IDE ,I have used AngularJS 1.x now for a couple of months. Now I will switch to Angular2 (with TypeScript) and actually I am not sure which IDE to use.It is also not clear for me how to compile the TypeScript Code into JavaScript - actually is this necessary?I have read that Visual Studio Code would be a nice editor for Angular2 projects - is there a TypeScript compiler included? I would be glad for any information in this direction. I was wondering myself which IDE is the best suited for Angular2. I'm a big > (+ Typescript plugin).Better BUT no support for auto import (maybe it has some now ?) and also I had to wait 30s before I get any autocompletion. Then I tried Webstorm as the company I'm currently working at has some licences. It was great and I was really happy for a month. But using an editor that is not free felt ... weird. I wouldn't use it at home for personal projects I couldn't recommend it to other people easily. And honnestly I'm not a super fan of Webstorm interface. So I gave (another) try to  that I didn't find so great when I first tried it few months ago. It has seriously evolved and :- it's simple- it's complete   - Code   - Debugger (remote --&gt; super powerful)   - Git integration   - Plugin store- it has great great Angular2 support- intellisense is really awesome I'm using it since a month and so far I'm really happy and do not feel the need to change. Just to help you start with good plugins here's mine : Angular-cli compiles your Typescript and even your (sccs|sass|less) files. When you want to deploy your app : Will also minimify JS and CSS.  Once you feel more comfortable with Angular2 in general I'd strongly recommend you to learn (more) about- -

284,Making Source writable from the Delphi IDE ,"Is it possible to make readonly source code (eg. .pas &amp; .dfm) writable from within the Delphi IDE?  The right click option to make files Readonly/Writable within the IDE doesn't change the properties on the file system.  Is there an IDE extension or similar that can achieve this? A way to do this without having to integrate a source control system would be preferable.  I am using Delphi XE and Delphi 6. Thanks! sseThis is how I would do it. Create a new package which will be installed into the IDE at designtime. If you have an existing package handy then you could carry on using it. Make sure the package  clause. Now add the following unit to your package. When you compile and install this package you will now have a new menu item on the File menu which both clears the read-only flag in the input buffer and makes the file writeable. You can call a .bat file from the tools menu.  So you could write a .bat file to do the work for  you and call it with $EDNAME as the parameter.Your .bat file should see the filename as %1.  Then you'd need a little bit of logic to change the read-only flag (attrib command?) and then see if there is a .dfm and do that one as well. You could also (obviously) make a Delphi command-line app to do this if you're not comfortable with .bat files.   This idea inspired by this article that talks about how to use a .bat file to integrate SVN commands with the Delphi tools menu: Another idea: Just add an option to the tools menu: ""open command prompt here"". It lets you do all sorts of things from the command line such as running the attrib command. Add a new entry to the Tools menu and use these settings: Also make yourself an ""Open Folder Here"" entry:"
285,What IronPython IDE should I use? ,"This question probably looks a lot like  that integrates with Visual Studio.  It was a logical choice for me because I use Visual Studio when I work with C#. One of the problem I have with IronPython Studio is that I cannot change the default colors.  I have a dark gray background color and black Python code doesn't look very good on that background.  I looked in Environment-&gt;Fonts and Colors in Option dialog but couldn't find the option to change IronPython colors.  Let it be my side question:How to change default colors in integrated IronPython Studio? I heard about SharpDevelop but I don't know if it's going to be a big improvement of IronPython Studio.  I decided to ask you before I'll try it. So please could you please let me know of pros and cons of your favorite IronPython IDE.  Don't tell me ""I use XYZ IDE and love it"".

286,visual studio - IDE placement on dual monitors ,"What IDE placement (output errors threads watch etc..) do you use (coding/debugging) in Visual Studio on Dual Monitors?Well slightly off topic I sit in front of 5 monitors two for each machine Machine A Machine B Machine C I have them configured like so - Left: The IDE with as large an editor window as possible.Right: Everything else. I always keep the IDE in the left monitor and save the right monitor for the app when running in debug mode.  If you are setting breakpoints in message handlers for events that fire when a window is redrawn you can get into some irritating event loops when your IDE pops up and covers your app (likewise when you expose the app again). Outside of that it really depends on which windows I need at the moment (call stack output memory etc.). We have some developers at our studio that use widescreen monitors turned vertical for more screen real-estate for their code.  I think that you have to have driver support for this mode.  For example the nVidia control panel will support rotation of monitors to accomplish what I've described. You lose the horizontal in favor of the vertical but many programmers here really like that mode. Properties window takes up 2/3 width of top half of monitor 2. Output/Error List/Pending Changes in a tab strip ~100% of lower half of monitor 2. Everything else is on monitor 1. I keep my IDE in my main monitor and put the properties output etc. tool windows grouped together detached on my secondary monitor. If I need to use the IDE and the secondary monitor at the same time (usually I don't just because of the type of apps I've been working on currently) then I'll switch to having the tool windows re-docked and set to auto-hide (which also works pretty well when using remote desktop). It depends on the monitors I have my laptop on the left due to the limitations of my desk so I have got used to having my IDE on the decent monitor on the right.  I would say the IDE should be the monitor easier to see my right monitor is more centered than the left laptop monitor I use a Mac therefore my Windows Vista (and XP) is virtualized in a VMWare or Parallels virtual machine. Both programs contain bugs when using multiple monitors and Unity/Coherence mode (that is make the windows invisible and only see the running programs).  Only the latest VMWare 2.0 RC released a few days ago is capable of this. (not without some glitches).  I use a Macbook Pro and an external 22'' display. The ""Main"" display is the external (22 &gt; 15) ;) So the OS X menu bar dock etc. is there. The Macbook Pro internal display is the small secondary display in my case sitting left of the big screen.  When I use VStudio I have the main VS display in the main display maximized. And the Solution Explorer Properties Classes and a few other toolbars using the left smaller screen.  All I see is Code and some toolbars but mainly all code. When I debug the floating tools disappear and others appear where the code is (the code window becomes a little bit smaller to accomodate this). No more floating stuff as the application runs in the Macbook Pro smaller display while I keep seeing the code/values/etc in the visual studio big screen. It's a nice way to work. I'd recommend it anytime. There are people that think that multiple displays not always means better productivity; solutions like ""virtual desktops"" are nice but cannot replace the speed of your eye moving from screen 1 to screen 2 to quickly glance at a property. I've tried Spaces on the mac and it doesn't come close. At least for programming. I keep everything in the left monitor and my DB/Firefox in the right hand one.  Mainly because i switch dev between one monitor and two monitors depending where I am and I dont want to have to get used to two layout configurations for using VS.  On my left the main screen (20"") with the IDE and a smaller one (15"") with Chrome PDFs and apps at my right :)"
287,c# - Looking for an online IDE ,I have been looking for a fairly decent online IDE that does well with both c# and java I have tried Cloud9IDE CodeRun and Amy Editor.  I really had liked CodeRun until i found that it was impossible for me to add another file into the same project unless i was just doing it wrong which is possible.  Amy Editor was very promising also until i couldn't figure out how to create a new project or compile the sample code i had written.  If anyone knows how to use these editors or of any other good online IDE environments then I'm game to learn.Why not run your IDE somewhere on a machine and connect to it remotely? You can even install your own Virtual Desktop on Amazon EC2 for example so you don't have to run the machine yourself. For an idea on how to do this see ? I think it's only been up and running for a few months but it's a pretty good website not sure if it meets your functionality needs though.
288,Liferay IDE Alternatives ,I am using Liferay Developer Studio for theme development and as a frontend developer I am not impress with the tool's performance. Below are few reasons I am looking for alternative IDE compatible for Liferay development. I am sure there are many others too faced same issues which actually makes the development slower. This question is not against the Liferay of course it's a great enterprise level CMS tool. But yes looking for alternate IDE with best compatibility for the purpose. Thanks in advance.You can use  as editor.  Please refere to those links : 1 -  You can use any IDE you want. The only one difference between LiferayIDE and others IDEs is you can avoid using BladeCLI by hands. And nothing can stop you to use another IDE build you project with maven or gradle and then continue to develop. If you are a front-end developer you really should use Gulp and Yo. First time you'll feel yourself confused a bit but after short period of time you'll understand all benefits.

299,testing - Using Selenium IDE with random values ,"Is it possible to create Selenium tests using the Firefox plugin that use randomly generated values to help do regression tests? I would like to help my clients do acceptance testing by providing them with a suite of tests that use some smarts to create random (or at least pseudo-random) values for the database. One of the issues with my Selenium IDE tests at the moment is that they have predefined values - which makes some types of testing problematic.  First off the Selenium IDE is rather limited you should consider switching to Selenium RC which can be driven by Java or Perl or Ruby or some other languages. Using just Selenium IDE you can embed JavaScript expressions to derive command parameters.You should be able to type a random number into a text field for example:  You can define helper functions in a file called ""user-extensions.js"". See the . >You can mix literals and random numbers like this: Gmail makes possible that automatically everything that use aliases for example  Multiplying *11111 to give you more random values than 1 to 9 (in Thilo example) You can add user exentions.js to get the random values . Copy the below code and save it as .js extension (randomgenerator.js) and add it to the Selenium core extensions (SeleniumIDE--&gt;Options---&gt;general tab) Way to use  Above code generates 6 charactes string and it assign to the variable x Code in HTML format looks like below: Here's a one-line solution to generating a random string of letters in JS: Useful for pasting into Selenium IDE. A one-liner for randomly choosing from a small set of alternatives: I made a little improvment to the function generateRandomString.When FF crashes it's good to be able to use the same random number again. Basically it will ask you to enter a string yourself. If you don't enter anything it will generate it. function generateRandomString( length chars ) {var string=prompt(""Please today's random string""'');if   (string == '')    {for ( var i = 0 ; i &lt; length ; i++ )        string += chars[ Math.floor( Math.random() * chars.length ) ];    return string;}    else    {    return string;}}"

313,IDE for css.less files dreamweaver ,"I'm using lesscss the 'framework/compiler' for css. My IDE dreamweaver does not recognize  as CSS. So no niceties such as error checking or code completion there. Is there anything I can do about that? Dreamweaver can be configured to recognize ""new"" filetypes and treat them as editable under preferences.  You can also edit some config files to help DreamWeaver figure out how to treat the files so it does code highlighting etc. though in my experience it does not always work as you would expect.  On the other hand can lesscss be configured to output .css files? Here's an Adobe article on getting Dreamweaver to add new file types. that might be of help Try giving the extension: less.css to your css file.Example: styles.less.css. This worked for me but I still need a base stylesheet such as: styles.css. Also You can compile .less files to .css directly from within Dreamweaver using a free (Donation-ware) plugin:   Dreamweaver has a very hard time with LESS in my experience. It doesn't properly handle nesting and will color those as though they are syntax errors. However it is mostly workable since the auto-complete does at least still work and the overall coloring is okay on everything except nested items. (at least for me) Also the extensions that are referenced above do not work on mac.  If you are having trouble getting DW to be able to open and color code LESS at all try this--  For Mac users there are TWO configuration folders (at least for DW5.5). Two sets of identical files FOUR in total files have to be changed: ~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS5.5/en_US/Configuration/DocumentTypes/MMDocumentTypes.xml~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS5.5/en_US/Configuration/Extensions.txt Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.5/Configuration/DocumentTypes/MMDocumentTypes.xmlAdobe Dreamweaver CS5.5/Configuration/Extensions.txt And this technote tells you what exactly to change in those files:  and for those on mac this little app works GREAT. All it does is watch your less files and automatically save them to css on save. This actually does all that and more as CSS and less have a little different syntax specially when it comes to nesting rules inside one another."
314,eclipse - IDE comment keywords ,So I only recently discovered the TODO comment. For those of you that don't know most modern IDE's will recognize this word in a comment and flag the comment line a different colour so It stands out. EG.

Their purpose is to help with development after all..I can speak of Eclipse you can customize it. Click on > assigned to the different task tags there too. These are known as  Here you can modify the available list of task tags change their priority and decide if task tags should be case sensitive or not.

317,python - Does Django need an IDE? ,"My company is evaluating the possibility of developing a specialized IDE for Django.  So we would like to ask Django users:  Do you feel the need for a specialized IDE for Django? Would you be willing to pay for it or would you only consider free a open-source product?  What Django-specific features are you missing currently in your development tools?It's great that your company wants to contribute to the community but I have to say that I don't see what a 'Django IDE' would achieve. There are already plugins for all the main editors and IDEs to support Django - from Vim to TextMate to NetBeans - and these provide syntax highlighting indentation shortcuts and snippets for both Python source and Django templates. These can always do with more work of course so perhaps your efforts would be best focused on improving one of these. I would pay a reasonable amount for a Django-tailored IDE or plug-in. I don't know what I mean by reasonable but maye it helps to know that I would not pay more than $75 and I would only pay the $75 if the tool was really awesome. Now Django specific features: If I can think of anything else I will edit the answer. Good luck in designing your product! I am using Komodo Edit and it's very good. There is a lot of good open-sources product so i don't think that I would buy a commercial product.  Maybe a very good and easy-to-use debugger would make me change my mind.  I hope it helps.  You'll likely want an IDE that will provide you with the ability to do source-level debugging of your accompanying Python code. Without it your productivity will really be below what it could be. I use  but vice-versa. yes I will donate. I would definitely pay or donate for a pure Django IDE even tho there are already some existing plugins I feel something is always ""floating"". "

Does anybody know of a way to use the IDE with Drupal or if not what do you suggest I do?You can in the same way that you can use selenium on just about any web page.  From what I can see (though I haven’t' used it) the selenium module seems to be more about using Drupal to store and run selenium tests which is useful but will not explicitly test your Drupal site. (>) Drupal comes with it's own testing framework which uses  This is nice because you can then do continuous integration testing by using Drush to script the running of your tests. The question is what do you want to achieve? The Firefox &amp; Selenium IDE (FF extension) combination works great with Drupal for functional testing. It also works great if you want to capture some Drupal configuration settings (that you'd like to play back e.g. in another environment) but there are better ways - Patterns and Strongarm modules - to achieve that. A couple of tips &amp; tricks: while capturing clicks be careful with timings (between clicks) sometimes you need to add ""pause"" lines to your test case for HTML form checkboxes Selenium often records the ""click"" action instead of the much safer ""check"" or ""uncheck"" action (this is important if you run your test case several times against the same page / form) if your page reloads when you click a certain link use ""clickAndWait"" instead of the simple ""click"" action use ""verifyTextPresent"" often especially if you're running your tests ""blindly"" using Selenium RC. I use selenium IDE all the time. It's an awesome tool for productivity and communication.  But Drupal's Simpletest framework has a built in browser for user testing. So you probably won't that module. See:."

You can use the editor of your choice like  The state of Ruby IDEs in 2016 is very sad the original question does not deserve to be rated down as it addresses a valid point. Except Intellij Rubymine there is no actively maintained fully featured IDE available for Ruby that supports Intellisense (or comparable functionality) and fast visual debugging. Unless you shell out more than USD200 in the first year and still more than USD100 each subsequent year to Intellij you'll have to do with Emacs Vi(m) Atom Visual Studio Code etc. like solutions for source code editing without Intellisense support and rely on rdebug ruby-debug-ide (super slow!) or my favorite debugging console: pry. I am hoping for someone to enable Intellisense for Ruby in Visual Studio Code and provide a decent debugging plugin there. There are many IDEs which support Ruby. There is Ruby Mine from Intellij Netbeans has a Ruby setting. Atom has a Ruby setting and is my favorite right now. I'm sure Visual Studio and Visual Studio code both have Ruby plugins.  Typically programming languages do not come with a dedicated IDE because IDEs only help you a little technically you can just use Notepad. So it's up to you to find one that you like.

But I'm trying to avoid having to do that every time. I want to press a run button and see the results on the console. Is there something already out there. Can I configure my IDE in certain way to achieve that? Thanks in advance. Take a look at Atom 
326,php - IDE for CodeIgniter framework ,i am going to use codeigniter php framework to develop web application. now i am confused about using IDE. I do not know which IDE is best suitable for codeingiter framework. is there any one who can help me in this regard. thanks.If you want a simple IDE you can go for  just use Google for the others). There is many IDE Editor available in market for development but PHP Storm and Sublime text Editor is best for PHP Development I found netbeans the best IDE for php development so far. It has got nice auto-completion feature debugging utility and most importantly easy to use version controll system to list some. Before I've used Zend Studio for coding but then I've moved to the Netbeans as far as it's the best IDE for me with very useful plug-ins such as svn git etc... and auto code format functionality is very useful to make your code neat and improve the readability of your code.
327,MacOS MongoDB IDE ,I am new in MongoDB and have been working with Oracle and SQL Server that have some easy to install and easy to use IDE. I know that Mongo already have some for windows but is there any MongoDB IDE for MacOS?  is pretty good. Although their shell version is a little behind. Its ok for querying and stuff not so great for admin tasks like adding/managing users.

329,IDE integration with GIT ,We're considering migrating from CVS to GIT. Our whole development process is centered around IntelliJ and the plugin we've found (GIT4idea) is severely lacking. Essential features like global history logs or diff changes are completely missing. Are there any other alternatives in IntelliJ land? And if not which current Java IDE do you consider to have the best GIT integration? is now the official Git plugin for Eclipse and offers a quite complete set of Git feature right within Eclipse.

There is an abundance to choose from: IntelliJ Atom Sublime Spacemacs Emacs Vim whatever you want. Personally I like Atom but that's just me.
331,java - Is jEdit usable as an IDE? ,"After some frustration with other text editors I recently discovered .  It seems like a light-weight editor that has so many plugins that it could be grown to be a full IDE.  I especially like how it handles SQL.  I've found quite a few people that happily converted from Emacs to jEdit.  But have yet to find people that converted from an IDE. I'm not trying to argue which is the best IDE.  I just want to know if people are actively using jEdit as an IDE and how it compares to other IDE's they've used.  I have been trying to get jEdit to be an IDE but it appears to take quite a bit of configuration and I'm concerned it will just be a waste of time.Based on this I think you can:  I believe that the tool that was created to do specific task shall be preferred over tool which has wider range of use. (in general) So in case of jEdit - it is great but it is used more as good text editor. And full-scale IDEs (like NetBeans) are designed to do only one task - programming thus they are better at it.And I do not know of any project which uses jEdit as IDE. (Basically there are two big groups of projects - those that still use Notepad or gedit to do coding and those that use ""normal"" IDEs so jEdit lies in the middle and is never used) The key question is ""IDE for what?"" The big IDEs (Netbeans IntelliJ Eclipse) support certain mainstream languages very well but starting your own specific support for some smalland exotic language is relatively hard in these big and complex platforms.  jEdit is a very able text editor not and IDE but it can be easily brushed up to support a some IDE-like things with relatively little effort. Your programming can be done via jEdit macros Beanshell scripts Java or any other more modern language on the JVM such as Scala."

333,c# - selfhosted WebAPI runs in IDE but not outside of IDE ,"I have a selfhosted WebAPI built into a console app.  When I run it via the VisualStudio IDE everything works fine.  I have a client app that connects and interacts with the WebAPI app just fine.  However if I run my WebAPI app outside of the IDE by just double clicking the EXE my client app is unable to connect to it at all.  I do not get any real useful error information either there are two InnerExceptions in the client (on the PostAsXmlAsync call).  One says ""Unable to connect to remote server"" and the 2nd is ""An error occurred while sending the request"". Normally I'd troubleshoot and debug this myself if it were a consistent error.  But the key element here is if I run this all via the VisualStudio IDE everything works as expected. Can anyone provide some suggestions on what I should be looking at/for?  Thanx!1) If all you are doing is accessing the self host locally you can set the following configuration option: With that you don't have to run the process with elevated privileges (again if you want to access it locally). 2) Another option is to reserve a specific port for the specific user: That also allows you to run self host not as admin as long as the process is started for a user for whom the port has been reserved. 3) Finally the last option is to just run it as admin."

336,php - Web based IDE solution ,"What I want to do is to work on my projects from ""everywhere"" with internet connection I tried followings: Tried to connect from my office to main PC with remote desktop apps like: Team Viewer etc.. It's very slow and boring. (Seeing what I typed after 2-3 second delay and it's really annoying) Carrying laptop with myself also not good idea. (It's weight about 4-5 kg.) Flash drive also not good idea... All my projects together is about 20-30 GB. The only comfortable way for me is:  (something like Netbeans I mean in-built project managementetc.. BUT web based).  I was looking for Web based IDE which supports PHP HTML JS and other various languages. My main PC is always connected to internet. So if there is any good open source (or free) solution I can serve this IDE either from my webhosting account or directly from my PC. (For ex. this service  is exactly what I need. But there are some problems: 1 its paid. 2 I don't want to host my projects in third party servers. I need something like that but want to instal such system on my own servers ) What do you think about this/what's your suggestion? Thx in advance...You should check out Codiad -  - you can host it on your own server configure it to do what you need and access it anywhere. If you want to work on a project from anywhere then you may want to look at using a decentralised version control system like Git instead. Advantages is you can work on any machine with Git and an IDE or text editor and not relying on a third-party web-based service that can do anything with your data or may disappear overnight. As an alternative way of solving the problem: All my projects are hosted on GitHub. I split my work between three computers. When I sit down to work on a project I run  and any changes I’ve made on the others get pulled down. You won’t have to re-sync all 20GB of data just the bits that you’ve changed. Then you can continue to work using native OS applications. You can install Git for free on your own server.  though. I use it a lot and while there's somewhat of a learning curve to it you can use it anywhere there's a console (linux or putty on windows) and I think it has all of the features you've mentioned."

Sencha’s recently launched JetBrains plugin is an Integrated Development Environment tool that creates a confluence between Sencha Frameworks and JetBrains software. This integration comes in the form of code completion inspection and suggestion while seamlessly cooperating with native JetBrains behavior. Cheapest license available is for WebStorm infact free for students and other special categories. Sencha experts will love the the ease with which changes are refactored and how simple it is to trace code to the source. Sencha beginners will benefit as the JetBrains plugin provides completion suggestions while encouraging best-practice code structure and syntax.

338,IDE for PHP with Visual Designer? ,"Im new to PHP..I commonly see online that many PHP developers like to code php in simple notepad.. however   its always nice to use an IDE which helps the user being more productive by making fewer mistakes and writing good code. My Question is ""WHICH IS THE BEST IDE FOR DEVELOPMENT IN PHP?"" Im looking for a PHP IDE which provides good:- For me its important to have a visual designer in an IDE. Various IDE's dont have this such as Netbeans. Also is there any way to develop PHP applications in Visual Studio? (without/with using VS add-on)First of all I dont like to say ""I prefer Notepad"". It is just a lie and foolishness. Notepad is good for students who want to learn very basic. For an experienced programmer it is wasting of time like saying MSDOS is better than Windows7 . :D In my line of work I have used Eclipse NuSphere phpED Netbeans Dreamveawer PHPDesigner PSPad UltraEdit and Notepad as well. Among them Dreamveawer has the Visual Designer but for PHP I dont like it much. Eclipse Netbeans PHPDesigner and NuSphere phpED are my best choice for PHP coding. I like the code completion feature of them. I suggest you can do the design part with Dreamveawer (DV is best for Visual Designing for me). Then you can use another IDE for PHP Coding. Eclipse &amp; Netbeans are both doing a nice job and are free. :) For designing you can use Dreamweaver etc and then later embedd PHP code  Use -markkoberlein I user .  About your requests: My experience with ide:s is that almost every ide out there is realy good but they allmoust allways lack in som functionality. For instance:PHPEdit is the only ide that has good support for sitedebugging with . I think is a great ide and ther's also a personal lisence for opensource projects d.s. Expression Web 4 isn't the most robust for PHP but it's got the HTML and CSS (visually) down pretty well. Doesn't have the ""Live View"" of DW though. I completely recommend you try PHPStorm. It doesn't have the visual features of DW but it excels in PHP. Debugging is easy to set up. It does language injection (autocompleting HTML in PHP statement for example) which almost no other IDE does. It pretty light on it's feet and is very extensible.  For design view - drag and drop components onto a form - take a look at Embarcadero's HTML5 builder.     Set form and component properties write PHP and JavaScript Events.Forms for visual components and a hidden ""datamodule"" form for database connection query and table components to work out your data logic.     This upgrades and renames their RadPHP product which was principally for building PHP/javascript browser applications - a sort of Visual Studio for the PHP language - and adds development for mobile devices with this upgrade.Lots of features but only shows those relevant to whether you are designing coding or debugging to keep it simple.     Gives easy intuitive and quick results for the novice (like me!) and rapid development for experts. The hype is about mobile but is still an awesome web development tool - and not expensive compared with other editors.  Sorry if this sounds like a sales pitch but the IDE deserves to be better known."

I'm interested in working with Julia but unfortunately I'm having trouble in finding a program that has a ""not bad"" Julia debugger as RStudio does for R. I'm interested in an IDE to use in a mac in an offline way. Thank youPS: I've checked other messages over the web but I just found 2014's messages  is the Julia debugger. Pretty soon (next week?) the Juno developers will release a new version of Juno which has Gallium integrated into their IDE. This requires Julia v0.5. While there's still a ways to go this sounds like what you're looking for."
342,Ruby IDE (from a Visual Studio background) ,For a university I was advised to learn Ruby before starting. I have a strong .NET background (with C#) and would like to find an IDE for Ruby. I'm currently very familiar with/used to VS2010 and VS2012.I find  have plugins for Ruby between the two I personally prefer Netbeans but I only use them for Java programming. For Ruby I use Vim which you can customize into whatever needs you have. All the people I know use a text editor for Ruby (at my company either Vim or Sublime Text 2). Not that Ruby programmers can't use an IDE but they generally don't. If you're looking to learn Ruby might be worth trying it out without a full fledged IDE. If you already have Visual Studio 2010 installed (seems to always be installed as part of other Microsoft Tools) Ruby In Steel 2.0 is definitely worth a look. Sure it's using an older shell but it's fast and familiar.

345,eclipse - Installing ANTLR IDE with Aptana ,I'm trying to install Antlr IDE with Aptana and I got this error log from the Update Manager. What exactly is going on?From what I see ANTLR IDE is based on Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) while Aptana Studio stand-alone is shipped with Eclipse 3.6. That's probably the reason you are getting this installation issue. You can install Aptana Studio as a plugin on top of Eclipse 3.7 and then install ANTLR IDE as well. Checkout the  (Aptana Studio tab) for the Studio's update site. Cheers As a side note... I was hesitated helping you out. You have 0% acceptance rate so take this into attention. Others may not help.

If I integrate the standard libraries like in x64 / x86 programs: and include them with: it is not posiible to use the opencv functions. Has anybody experiences with openCV the SailfishOS IDE and Jolla?OpenCV is already packaged for Mer:  You just need to build it for SailfishOS install the -devel package under SDK and you're ready to go.
347,python - Markdown in Spyder IDE ,I was experimenting in the Spyder IDE and learned that it is possible to define cells using the  separator. Now I couldn't find it but is it possible to use markdown like in a Jupyter notebook?No. As far as I know Spyder IDE has no markdown implemented as Jypter notebook even if it is connecting to a Jupyer notebook instance locally. I would suggest you to use Jupyter notebook for coding and annotation if you need such a thing. Spyder is just a IDE. But if you want to edit Jupyter notebook in a IDE just take a look at PyCharm IDE.
348,terminology - Java Framework IDE ,Hi anybody please tell me the difference between IDE and a FRAMEWORK suppose that am using eclipse (for java) by default which framework am following.IDE Stands for Integrated Development Environment and is a tool that allows you to program in a certain language and usually includes an integrated compiler debugger syntax highlighting and various other tools that allow you to develop applications quicker. E.g. Eclipse IDE Visual Studio Netbeans IDE. A framework is a library or set of classes that makes it easier to implement a certain type of application and is usually deployed with your application. It usually provides a structure that you need to adhere to and various helper classes. E.g. Spring Framework .Net MVC Struts etc. IDE is the development environment the editor where you would normally write code. It also might include a compiler debugger ... A framework is a set of reusable libraries or classes which you could use in your code. Some IDE's (eclipse netbeans) offer a > a framework i.e. you follow its rules enjoy its benefits and suffer its limitations (although a good framework offers extension points to minimise these).  Contrast this with a library which is a collection of code units (e.g. functions classes etc.) from which you draw as necessary but without constraining the structure of your own code. Using a framework is a bigger architectural decision than using a library. A typical enterprise project will use one or more frameworks and several libraries.

352,cil - IDE for MSIL ,There's any number of questions about MSIL on SO but none that directly answer this. I've been using  which does have a syntax definition file for MSIL and then using ILASM in a command prompt window. I did find a reference to ILIDE but the link is broken. Is there an IDE or add-on / plugin to Visual Studio / Eclipse for MSIL that allows syntax highlighting intellisense code completion debugging etc.?Use  (note : strangely some links to ilide are broken some of them even mentioning earlier links that are broken  but then supply a link that's broken too.  I was able to dowload it and Installed it succesfully from the link above though). further   : . IIRC Visual Studio will give you debugging if you assemble with /debug.  I think MS had a demo or sample of some VS plugin that helped a bit with IL. I'm not sure what it was named or if it was released.

355,An alternative IDE for Sybase Powerbuilder ,"Does anyone know of an alternative IDE for Sybase Powerbuilder?  It feels pretty clunky after working with VS2008 and Eclipse. If not has anyone successfully worked with this language outside the IDE? I'm not against using a simple text editor but I find edit-import-regenerate-test-export-edit is clunkier than simply using the Powerbuilder editor. To date the only tools I have had any success with are: EDIT: I added a bounty to draw some wider attention to the question.  It would be a very nice thing to have if it exists. EDIT: Well that was disappointing.  The bounty apparently did not cause even 1 new person to look at the question.None that I'm aware of although you could probably use a source control tool edit in your source control repository and Get Latest Version from the PB IDE to shorten your text editor cycle. Be warned that there are hacks required to edit anything over 128 ASCII. (My guess is that this is to allow everything Unicode to be source controlled in the most restrictive source control tools.) As Paul said PB12 is coming with based on the Visual Studio shell and will include things like collapsible code blocks Intellisense etc.... However for PB12 this will only be used for WPF targets and a few .NET-type targets (like assemblies) last I heard. Win32 targets will continue to use the ""classic"" IDE. Good luck Terry. P.S. Thanks for the PBL Peeper compliment. The PowerBuilder IDE  clunky but I don't think developing completely outside the PowerBuilder IDE is a good idea.  I think there are just too many dependencies right now. However the IDE for PowerBuilder 12 will be built using Microsoft's Visual Studio Isolated Shell so it ought to be much better when that is released.  Also I believe they'll be doing away with the PBL format which ought to make source control much easier to work with. Certainly something to watch. What I do is right-click the object and edit source. Then I copy the text and paste it into Notepad++ to edit. I copy and paste back to PowerBuilder then I can save and see any errors. I've got a fairly decent User Defined Language for PowerScript if anyone's interested. Added:Please be aware that I've seen the PB Source editor corrupt DataWindows. They were all large DataWindows. To be safe always export DataWindows to edit. One tool that will most probably make your PB experience way better is Visual Expert which provides a good source browser. Such a tool should have been integrated into the PB IDE a long time ago IMHO. Only problem is that it's not free as opposed to the other tools you mention. Regarding using external source editors you can probably take advantage of OrcaScript which is a scripting language that lets you perform actions such as export and import of PB objects from outside of the IDE. It will require some effort but you can setup a basic dev env using batch files with ORCA scripts and some additional external tools. However this setup will lack any visual editing capabilities which means no (feasible) GUI or DW work. If you're mostly into NVOs it could work. But then if that's the case why use PB in the first place?... I too have heard PB12's use of VS will be limited to some .NET stuff which will probably benefit only a very small portion of the PB programmers community. I'm afraid the rest of us are stuck with the awful IDE for years to come. Other than exporting the source and editing it I don't know of another IDE for PB. One problem you may have is that the exported source contains a lot of syntax that is not documented in the manuals.  The PB IDE generates this code but there is no support for creating it by hand.  I think you are stuck with the PB IDE In my modest five Years of experiences starting with Powerbuilder 5/6 now using PB 10 I tempt to : ... i came to the conclusion that there will be no chance in improving Powerbuilder to an state-of-the-art language In my philosophy - I obtained during those years - I distinguish between two types of OOP-oriented languages: ...In memory of the good old Unix(Solaris)/C++ days... I was researching a replacement solution that would be similar to PowerBuilder and I came across two that caught my eye. The first was 'React Studio'  . Still researching but I currently have React Studio at the top of our list."

The good thing is that besides the editor it comes with some other fancy and very useful XUL developer tools. And of course it is a great iTunes replacement ;) I think no Wysiwyg IDE available for Xulbut there is  it may help you

362,Why do we use WebDriver instead of Selenium IDE? ,Why can't we just record all of our test cases in  and run it in WebDriver with Eclipse? I need a clear explanation as I am very much confused in using WebDriver! And can anyone please explain why IDE recorded scripts fail in WebDriver?why cant we just record all of our test cases in IDE export it to java/webdriver and run it in webdriver Great question and here is the answer: Selenium IDE is a Record and Playback tool which is very easy to use but it's very unreliable.  Record and playback is typically a frowned upon in web applications.  Since web applications are frequently changed the IDE is not an ideal solution for a production environment because of the maintenance nightmare that may arise. Let me give you a practical example.  You record your test and you find an element with a dynamic ID.  Sure we can import it into eclipse but what happens when that test starts failing down the road? why not simply make your test agile and independent to catch these in the first place. It also boils down to your principles of test automation.  Test automation in MY opinion (and several other professionals) believe that test automation should be approached from a programming perspective.  Programmers should write the tests and maintain the tests.  Ideally your quality assurance personnel should be trained to write and maintain their own tests. So again back to your question the IDE is designed to be a quick solution to automation NOT a solution to a full regression suite.   And can anyone please explain why IDE recorded scripts fail in Webdriver? I haven't used the IDE in a while but the reason they fail is because the scripts that are exported are simply the  not an entire java file.  This also is because Selenium IDE exportations are supposed to be agnostic when it comes to how to run your test.  Say I'm a user of jUnit.. what if Selenium IDE exported it to TestNG all the time?  That wouldn't be fair.. honestly i'd rather create my own tests than changing that one line every single time i create my test file. You may read the full text of a research conducted called Why do Record/Replay Testsof Web Applications Break?For a Maven integration of flow controls command/aliases/macros used by Selenium IDE and Maven's SureFire test plugin see: for some examples. We've also used our selenium test cases for load testing with Soasta - WebDriver allows simple IDE tests to be used in many different contexts. Because when the complexity of your code will increase it will be difficult for you to manage it using IDE. Maintenance of your scripts will be difficult using IDE. Also Exporting test cases from IDE to webdriver is not 100% reliable. Other people have said a lot of helpful answers. One thing that is missing is that if you write code instead of using the IDE you have the power to make changes to the database. It depends on the website you are testing how useful this is but here are some useful examples I've experienced. In one case the website had multiple sections of a class. One of our tests was merging these sections into one. The IDE couldn't do this. But with webdriver we can add all of our test data into the database perform the merge and then remove the data from the database.  Another advantage that webdriver has is Selenium Grid. With Grid you can run your tests in parallel and on multiple browsers. This makes your testing run faster and you can more thoroughly test the code.

364,Eclipse (Android) IDE error ,"I get an error like below when running all projects in eclipse IDE but in individual files(XML or JAVA) there are no errors specified.I was getting this This means your ""Platform Tool"" package is out of date. Please update it using the SDK Manager. I think problem related to eclipse version or android ADT. then try reinstall a newest version Eclipse. maybe this link help to you:  on your files change the utf coding to 8 at the top.  In the xml files it says ""encoding="" edit that to say 8."
365,Using IDE together with docker ,I started looking into docker lately and I understand a lot of the benefits it offers I think you can quickly create a docker container and run it on different machines. Building (compiling) is also relatively easy you can download the maven image for example and just build your code. That works fine. So building is easy testing is easy and deploying (and running) in production is easy.  What I don't understand is how docker can make the development phase easier. And what I mean with the development phase is starting up your IDE reading code quickly navigate through your methods definition using the methods the IDE provides use intelliSense etc. Then change something run a unit test try a different third party library etc. All things you can do with your IDE. But I don't understand how to do this with a docker image. I've read a few posts about starting the IDE from within your docker container but that requires setting things up with a windows manager and I am not sure if that's the way to go. Of course I can set up my laptop in such a way that I can do all of this with my IDE but that way I bypass all of the benefits docker should offer. I still have to download dependencies set up environment variables do a lot of manual settings etc. And not just me but everyone in the team.  So not a very concrete question possibly a duplicate but I just can't wrap my head around it how to use an IDE together with docker?Yeah it's hard. It also depends on what language/framework you're using. But the things you mention are all easy to accomplish. For example we use Ruby a lot and someone in my team uses RubyMine to work with his code. That source code is mapped onto the container so the changes are reflected immediately. If you want to run a test I'm sure you can override the command your IDE brings by default with something custom like  or similar. At least that's what I do with VIM. Probably the most important missing part when doing dev with Docker is debugging. I think JetBrains is starting to add features to their IDE's but I'm not sure on the status of that.  Also almost every IDE or good editor has an integrated console. You could maintain a docker exec sessions opened there and run all your app commands like tests generators or any other. Even do some basic debugging. Hope it helps.

370,Good C++ Debugging/IDE Environment for Linux? ,I have a friend who is trying to make the switch to Linux but is hung up on the apparent lack of debugging/IDE environments for C++ especially as they relate to template programming. He has been using visual studio for years and is maybe a little spoiled by their awesome IDE. Does anyone have any good suggestions for an environment where he can under Linux develop and debug with all of the usual things (Breakpoints line highlighting for compilation errors step in/over/out/etc etc) that he's accustomed to? Thanks!Although many people think of it as a Java IDE he could try  is very nice too but you will need a very good computer. In my opinion the best choice iss gcc gdb and ViM or Gedit. My buddies from work use Eclipse + Scons they also use Valgrind(spelling?) for tracking memory leaks and such. Many of the IDE features you listed were debugger features.  The ddd (Data Display Debugger) debugger is quite a nice GUI wrapper for gdb allowing graphical representation of data structures a non-crappy source listing window (ie. unlike the l command of gdb where you don't get context) and also allows you to use any and all native gdb commands directly if desired. Have a look at CodeLite. It's available for Ubuntu and Fedora out of the box and even for Windows and Mac. So you can have the same IDE on different platforms. We tried Eclipse and NetBeans but left them due to their huge CPU and memory usage. We have a development server and all the developers connect to it via RDC. Thats why these IDEs miserably failed in our model. So we looked for some native IDE. Found CodeBlocks to be very good and super fast. We sort of settled on it but later found CodeLite and liked it better than CodeBlocks.

372,What is a best IDE for oracle? ,"I Work on a ORACLE 8.0.I know how to run oracle SQL command's in SQLPLUS.I searched to find a IDE such as SQL Server Management Studio but couldn't find it.  what is best IDE for ORACLE?thanks ""Best"" is a matter of opinion - available environments include: Wow.  Oracle 8.0 has been obsolete for almost 15 years.  That's an ancient version of the database.  Are you sure you're really using something that old?  That definitely complicates things because it means that any vaguely recent version of the Oracle client won't be able to connect to the database so you're eliminating the vast majority of tools. If you're really stuck with an ancient version of Oracle the old Java based Enterprise Manager application that shipped as a part of the Oracle client is the closest thing to SQL Server Management Studio.  I don't know if that was available way back in Oracle 8.0 but the version that shipped with the 8.1.7 Oracle client should connect to an Oracle 8.0 database.  Of course Oracle no longer makes either the 8.0 or 8.1.7 Oracle client available for download and you'd need to have a pretty old version of the operating system to be able to install something that old.  If you still have a support agreement (though that seems unlikely since you haven't upgraded Oracle in my working lifetime) you might be able to open a support request and get Oracle to send you a CD for desupported versions of the database or client."
373,Why use an IDE? ,"This may be too opinionated but what I'm trying to understand why some companies mandate the use of an IDE. In college all I used was vim although on occasion I used netbeans for use with Java. Netbeans was nice because it did code completion and had some nice templates for configuration of some the stranger services I tried.  Now that my friends are working at big companies they are telling me that they are required to use eclipse or visual studio but no one can seem to give a good reason why. Can someone explain to me why companies force their developers into restricted development environments?If you're good at using vim and know everything there is to know about it then there is no reason to switch to an IDE. That said many IDEs will have lots of useful features that come standard. Maintaining an install of Eclipse is a lot easier than maintaining an install of Vim with plugins X Y and Z in order to simulate the same capabilities. And the most important of all... I love vim and will use it for simple things or when I want to run a macro or am stuck with C code. But for more complicated tasks I'll fire up Eclipse/Visual Studio/Wing. I've written code in lots of different IDEs and occasionally in notepad.  You may totally love notepad but at some point using notepad is industrial sabatoge kind of like hiring a gardener who shows up with a spoon instead of a shovel and a thimble instead of a bucket.  (But who knows maybe the most beautiful garden can be made with a spoon and a thimble but it sure isn't going to be fast) Some IDE's have team and management features.  For example in Visual Studio there is a screen that finds all the TODO: lines in source code. This allows for a different workflow that may or may not exist in other IDEs.  Ditto for source control integration static code analysis etc. Big organizations are slow to change. Not really a programming related problem. Because companies standardize on tools as well as platforms--if your choice of tools is in conflict with their standards then you can either object silently use your tool or use the required tool.   All three are valid; provided your alternative doesn't cause other team-members issues and provided that you have a valid argument to make (not just whining). For example: I develop in Visual Studio 2008 as required by work but use VS2010 whenever possible.  Solutions/Projects saved in 2010 can't be opened in 2008 without some manual finagling--so I can't use the tool of my choice because it would cause friction for other developers.  We also are required to produce code according to documented standards which are enforced by Resharper and StyleCop--if I switched to a different IDE I would have more difficulty in ensuring the code I produced was up to our standards.  Sufficiently bad developers are greatly assisted by the adoption of an appropriately-configured IDE.  It takes a lot of extra time to help each snowflake through his own custom development environment; if somebody doesn't have the chops to maintain their own dev environment independently it gets very expensive to support them. Corporate IT shops are very bad at telling the difference between ""sufficiently bad"" and ""sufficiently good"" developers.  So they just make everybody do the same thing. Disclaimer: I use Eclipse and love it. Theoretically it would decrease the amount of training needed to get an unexperienced developer to deal with the problems of a particular IDE if all the team uses that one tool. Anyway most of the top companies don't force developers to use some specific IDE for now... I agree with this last way of thinking: You don't need your team to master one particular tool having team knowledge in many will improve your likelyhood to know better ways to solve a particular roblems. For me I use Visual Studio with ReSharper.  I cannot be nearly as productive (in .Net) without it.  At least nobody has ever shown me a way to be more productive... Vim that is great.  You can run Vim inside of Visual Studio + R# and get all the niceties that the IDE provides like code navigation code completion and refactoring. Same reason we use a hammer to nail things instead of rocks.  It's a better tool. Now if you are asking why you are forced to use a specific IDE over another well that's a different topic. A place that uses .NET will use Visual Studio 99% of the time at least that's what I've seen.  And I haven't found anything out there that is better than Visual Studio for writing .NET applications. There is much more than code completion into an IDE: etc Nothing to do with incompetence from the programmers. Anybody would be A LOT less productive using vim for developing a big Java EE application. How big were you projects at college? A couple of classes in a couple of files? Or rather a couple of hundreds of classes in a couple of hundreds of files? Today I had the ""honor"" of looking at a file in a rather large project where the programmer opted to use vi (yes vi not vim) and a handcrafted commandline compiler call (no ). The file contained on function spanning about 900 lines with a series of if-else-if-else-constructs (because that way you have all your code in one place!!!!!!). Macho-Programmer at his finest. OK there are very good reasons for enforcing a particular toolset within a production environment: Companies want to standardize everything so that if an employee leaves they can replace that person with minimal effort. Commercial IDEs provide a complex enough environment to support a single interface for a variety of development needs and supporting varying levels of code access. For instance the same file-set could be used by the developer by non-programmers (graphics designers etc.) and document writers.  Combine this with integrated version control and code management without the need of someone learning a particular version control system all of a sudden IDEs start to look nicer and nicer. It also streamlines maintenance of build systems in a multi-homed environment. IDEs are easier to give tutorials to via phone or video and probably come with those. etc. etc. and so forth. The business decision making behind enforcing a standardized environment goes beyond the preference of a single programmer or for that matter perhaps the understanding of the programming team.   Using an IDE helps an employee to work with huge projects with minimal training. Learn a few key combos - and you will comfortably work with multi-thousand-file project in Eclipse IDE handles most of the work for you under the hood. Just imagine how many years of learning it takes to feel comfortable developing such projects in Vim. Besides with an IDE it is easy to support common coding standards across the entire team: just set a couple of options and an IDE will force you to write code in a standardized way. Plus IDE gives a few added bonuses like refactoring tools (especially good in Eclipse) integrated debugging (especially good in Visual Studio) intellisense integrated unit tests integrated version control system etc. The advantages and disadvantages of using an IDE also greatly depends on the development platform. Some platforms are geared towards the use of IDEs others are not. As a rule of thumb you should use IDE for Java and .Net development (unless you're extremely advanced); you should not use IDE for ruby python perl LISP etc development (unless you're extremely new to these languages and associated frameworks). Features like these aren't available in vim: Those are the reasons I choose IntelliJ.  I could go back to sticks and bones but I'd be a lot less productive. As said before the question about using an IDE is basicaly productivity. However there is some questions that should be considered by the company when choosing a specific IDE. that includes: Of course there is a lot more. However I think that this short list help you to see that there is some decisions that are not so easy to take when we are talking about money and some greater companies. And if you start using your own IDE think what mess will be when another developer start doing maintenance into your code. How do you think will the application be signed at the version manager ? Now think about a company with 30+ developers each using its own IDE (each with its own configuration files version and all that stuff)...  Real programmers use the best tools available to get the job done.  Some companies have licenses for tools but there's nothing saying you can't license/use another IDE and then just have the other IDE open to copy/paste what you've done in your local IDE. The question is a bit open-ended perhaps you can make it community wiki... As you point out the IDE can be useful or even a must have for some operations like refactoring or even project exploring: I use Eclipse at my work on Java projects and I find very useful to get a list of all occurrences of the usage of a public method or a class in a project. Likely I appreciate to be able to rename it from where it is defined and having all these occurrences automatically updated.The fact I have the JavaDoc displayed when hovering over a name is very nice too. Like autocompletion jump to a class name etc.And of course debugging facilities... Now usage of Eclipse isn't mandatory in our shop! Some years ago some people used the Delphi IDE (forgot its name) I tried NetBeans etc. But I think we > standardized on Eclipse but it was a natural evolution rather than a company policy. And we often just open files in a text editor when we need a quick update..."
374,Monaca IDE - console.log never appears ,X-Post from here for exposure:   Odd question but only once while using Monaca IDE has anything ever shown up in the console.log portion of the IDE itself. It only occurred when I had a device synced via the debugger. I have since tried syncing it and I never get the device to show in the drop down box it usually says unknown device /www/html/… Now do know that I have put several console.log(‘test’); lines of code to try this out and still no success. I would think that the IDE’s console area would show the log operations from the emulator and not from the device debugger as it has its own log that is view-able on the device but this apparently isn’t the case. Is this correct or am I just really missing something simple here?So this isn’t that big of an issue but I figured out the problem. Basically I keep the Monaca IDE tab open in Chrome all the time (I work via my laptop remotely). When I come back after a long absence (several hours I don’t know what the time out is) the bottom section in the console has the Chrome error showing like that page timed out. The IDE is still there just that section is grayed out. So to fix this I would just refresh the page. The section pops back and all is good EXCEPT I just figured out that it is at that moment when the device connection no longer works. I can still click Run on Device and it works - syncing with the device - but the console.log no longer shows up. In order to get that back and working you have to close the tab and reopen it; then everything works.

I cant switch tabs look through my source type code etc. It happens in pylde and pyscripter i havent tried other IDEs. What can i do to fix this? i'm actually doing  hoping the IDE will update once per second but it doesnt look that way. What can i do to fix this?I'm assuming you are running your code from within the IDE? Your IDE is probably blocking while running your code. Look for a setting of some sort which might control that behaviour otherwise I think your only choice would be to change IDE. (Or run your code from outside the IDE) Can you configure to run your script externally? I don't know about the specific IDEs but I would try to spawn a different process for the debugged script and not run them under the IDE. If that doesn't help then it is a problem of the IDEs. The problem is your IDE not python. I don't use sleep that often I've just tried it on the  IDE uses the background thread approach and it does not have this problem.

390,java - Weblogic without their IDE? ,I'm starting Java development at a place that uses Weblogic on their production and test servers.   I'd like to use Weblogic on my computer to develop my code.   It seems that Weblogic has a development environment where a personal web server/servlet container is tightly integrated with an Eclipse based IDE of theirs. I think I might like to go that way eventually but for right now I would like to keep using the IDE that I am used to. Can someone point me to a tutorial or a book that would explain how to set up and use Weblogic that way on my computer? For instance  I would produce a WAR file with my own tools  then stick it in a directory in Weblogic on my computer to run it and see how well it works. ThanksIf you have not already downloaded WebLogic I would suggest getting started with the Zip Distribution.  It is a smaller distribution than the full installer and you can get it up and running quickly.  Here's a YouTube demo of the Zip Distribution:  and you'll have a nice state-of-the-art development solution.

393,Decent JavaScript IDE ,What is a decent IDE for developing JavaScript I'll be writing both client side stuff and writing for Rhino. Ideally It needs to run on Mac OSX although something that runs on Windows too would be nice.  Having had a play with both js2 and Aptana I think I'll be continuing to use Aptana. Mainly because I find emacs a bit hard to get my head round although I did think that the error hi-lighting in js2 was better than that in Aptana. I'm still looking for a way to visually debug my js code that is running atop Rhino...Aptana IDE absolutely. Stable great syntax support for all the major javascript libraries very good css and html editors. Also good support for php air ruby on rails and iPhone app development (I never tested this one). Aptana can also connect to remote site via ftp (sftp in the pro edition) and to svn and cvs repositories. It's based on Eclipse so it's not exactly a lightweight application. But it's really really good. You can also use it as an Eclipse plugin if you develop java wab app but when I tested it in this version about 1 year ago it was not stable. Much better to use the standalone version. If you're familiar with Emacs Steve Yegge's  is definitely the best IDE/editor (that I have used) for developing JavaScript. Notable features include live error reporting JavaScript macros and syntax auto-complete for ALL major frameworks!  If you have a very big application written in Javascript there's only IntelliJ Idea. It parses multiple Javascript files and highlights not only syntax errors but undeclared variables and functions allows to jump from function call to function definition and more. I've tried Emacs (because that's my favorite editor) and Komodo and they don't come close. I guess it's the same for Eclipse. Personally I think that superior parsing and navigation abilties of Idea are only required when you're working with crappy undocumented code otherwise I'd happily write the code in Emacs using js2-mode but I'm working with huge poorly documented and buggy framework and it really helps to be able to jump to the source of the function or superclass to check how they work.
394,driver - PCI IDE/(P)ATA differences ,"I've read some articles about PCI and IDE/ATA and I'm a bit confused now. The PCI class 0x01 (mass storage controllers) contains an IDE (0x01) and an ATA (0x05) subclass. However from :  the standard was named ""AT Attachment"" for the IBM PC/AT (which in  turn meant Advanced Technology but ATA is not Advanced Technology  Attachment). But IDE and ATA are synonymous. ATA is a better term. So if they are the same why is there 2 different subclasses for them? Also in this post it is mentioned that  Both types of drives (SATA and PATA) are IDE devices. ...but when I config a Virtual Machine in oracle VM there are different: IDE SATA ect... controllers.  Also this post:  tells that the IDE and PCI are used for different connections but I tought that the ATA 'controllers' are connected to the PCI bus that's why I have to check them there. They are way different... PCI is used for soundcards video card etc...  IDE is used for CD ROMS hard drives floppy drives etc.. In VirtualBox when I attach an IDE floppy controller SCSI or any storage device it appears on the PCI bus just like sound cards and network cards. The more articles I read the more confused I become. It would be good to get some clear description of them.The terms ""IDE"" ""ATA"" and ""PATA"" get used interchangeably.  They generally all refer to a traditional 40/44pin ribbon wire HDD interface.  Note that a PCI or PCI Express IDE/ATA/PATA controller can operate in one of two modes: Legacy Mode - Emulates a legacy ISA bus IDE controller from the original PC.  Uses IRQs 14 and 15.  IRQs cannot be shared/remapped like a normal PCI device.  Only supports a limited number of IDE channels (primary/secondary).  Backwards compatible with every Operating System since the dawn of the PC. Native Mode - Acts like a traditional PCI device.  IRQ number is not fixed and may be shared with other PCI devices.  Supports an arbitrarty number of controllers in the system.  Requires Windows 2000 or later. With the introduction of SATA we have another layer of compatibility.  SATA controllers can typically be configured for one of two modes: IDE Mode - Works like a traditional IDE/ATA/PATA controller.  Allows backwards compatibility with older operating systems (Windows XP and earlier).  Note that in IDE mode you still might have the choice of Legacy vs Native Mode listed above. AHCI Mode - A modern programming interface for SATA controllers.  Natively supported by Windows Vista and later. So a SATA controller can be: To make things confusing some BIOSes will refer to IDE mode as ""Legacy"" and AHCI mode as ""Native"".  Also not all of the modes listed above will necessarily be available for your chipset/BIOS.  Older chipsets may not support AHCI.  Some newer chipsets drop support for the older modes.  Also on a motherboard with several SATA ports there may be a limitation on which ports can be in which mode. Clear as mud?  Great!  Now how does this map to PCI class codes?  Under PCI base class 01h (Mass Storage) there are several sub classes defined in the PCI Spec.  There are three that are relevant to your question. Sub-class 01h = IDE Controller Most IDE/ATA/PATA controllers will use this subclass So will a SATA controller in IDE Mode Both Legacy and Native Mode IDE controller will use this subclass.  You query other bits in the register map to determine which mode you are in. Sub-class 05h = ATA Controller with ADMA This is a special case IDE/ATA controller with special DMA capabilities. I have never seen an Intel or AMD chipset that uses this sub-class. Sub-class 06h = SATA Controller Typically this means a SATA controller in AHCI mode. However some early SATA controllers had a proprietary interface. The Programming Interface register will tell you what mode it is in. As for Oracle VM it probably gives you a choice of which mode the ""virtual"" HDD is presented to the guest Operating System.  I do not have a copy in front of me though.  Just glancing at the documentation it looks like there are choices for IDE (not clear if Native/Legacy/AHCI) or SCSI."
395,java - Weblogic without their IDE? ,I'm starting Java development at a place that uses Weblogic on their production and test servers.   I'd like to use Weblogic on my computer to develop my code.   It seems that Weblogic has a development environment where a personal web server/servlet container is tightly integrated with an Eclipse based IDE of theirs. I think I might like to go that way eventually but for right now I would like to keep using the IDE that I am used to. Can someone point me to a tutorial or a book that would explain how to set up and use Weblogic that way on my computer? For instance  I would produce a WAR file with my own tools  then stick it in a directory in Weblogic on my computer to run it and see how well it works. ThanksIf you have not already downloaded WebLogic I would suggest getting started with the Zip Distribution.  It is a smaller distribution than the full installer and you can get it up and running quickly.  Here's a YouTube demo of the Zip Distribution:  and you'll have a nice state-of-the-art development solution.

399,Python 3 IDE for teaching ,With Python 3 maturing and slowly gaining adoption we're taking the plunge and adopting it in our introductory programming classes for kids aged 12-18. Is there a > (preferably open source) IDE you'd recommend that supports Python 3 preferably meeting the following criteria in order of necessity:. It's pretty simple imo.12-18 is more like teenager not a kid I'm sure that they fluent with much more complicated interfaces like facebook :) The Python IDLE has most of these features (never used the debugger before so I don't know how good it is). It's probably the most minimalist Python IDE out there. See  I have been hearing a lot of praises about Aptana Studio recently ( made by the coders of PyDev ).Personally using Eclipse + PyDev and really recommend it.  is awesome. Looks good perform nicely and has now a Free Community Edition!

401,java - NetBeans IDE under Oracle ,"I'm a bit freaked about what I just read. I did some research as I want to start programming in Java and I came to the conclusion that NetBeans is the best IDE for me because of its capable Swing GUI Designer and powerful reporting with Jasper Reports (iReport).  Yet Oracle (who will soon buy Sun) doesn't seem to care about NetBeans. As I will start building appz in Java no too long from now I would like to know your opinion on the following matter: Shall I continue using NetBeans in spite of the rumours that Oracle will discontinue it or shall I make another the IDE of choice? PS: Basically NetBeans would be the choice but because of the current circumstances I'm doubting this decision. Thank you Oracle have put a lot of time and money into their own product JDeveloper.  It has some pretty neat features.  But it has never got much traction in the industry because many Java developers don't like using proprietary software even though Oracle make quite a big play over their commit to open standards. Anyway at the moment Oracle are still integrating a lot of their freshly acquired BEA WebLogic functionality into the JDeveloper suite.  But I'm sure that once they have sealed the deal to buy Sun they will start to look at what they can take from NetBeans.  Because whatever you may think about Larry Ellison's business methods he knows the value of a dollar.  If there are things worth having in NetBeans they will not be thrown away they will end up in JDeveloper.  So you say it will abandon NetBeans  and salvage some pieces which will go  into JDeveloper? In the long run Oracle will not maintain two Java IDEs.  But look at their strategy for handling previous acquisitions (Seibel JD Edwards BEA etc).  Oracle have kept those products current while they devised a plan for getting the customers onto Oracle's own brand applications.  In some cases this meant dumping Oracle's offering in favour of the acquired product (Seibel Analytics BEA WebLogic Server).  Oracle has made similar sounding pronouncements with regards to MySQL.  People may scoff but I think Oracle will keep MySQL going partly because Larry thinks they can make money from it but also just to spike .  The pertinent bit is NetBeans the Sun-driven open source  Java IDE that has competed with Oracle  JDeveloper and the Eclipse platform  will remain as a ""lightweight  development environment for Java  developers"" Kurian said. But  JDeveloper continues as Oracle's  enterprise development tool. I was a long time eclipse user and although I still like it for some things I believe Netbeans to be a far superior IDE for Java development.  I would say go ahead and use NetBeans.  You will appreciate it more than Eclipse.  In the worst case scenario that Netbeans is no longer supported you will be a much better developer by the time it has reached its end of life (i dont think this will happen though).   Eclipse is better than Netbeans IMHO even though eclipse doesn't allow you to create GUI. If NetBeans seem better for your needs  go with it. I prefer Eclipse but it's just a personal choice. Even if in the future NetBeans will be no longer supported you'll still be able to use it or you'll maybe prefer to start using a another IDE. Java code remain java code no matter of the IDE. I believe that NetBeans will remain supported even under Oracle reign. Since there's a lot of Java developer using it Oracle won't tell all of them to go away. You worry too much. So what if Oracle discontinues NetBeans next month? Your installation still works and will for a long time. Just keep the installer in case you have to set up a new computer. Later you can still make a switch to another IDE. Should Oracle discontinue NetBeans (or threaten to) surely most other IDEs will offer an ""Import NetBeans project"" option."
402,python 3.x - Spyder IDE won't open ,so I had Python 3.7.0 and my Spyder IDE was working fine.However because there was no version of tensorflow for that version of python I decided to downgrade my python to version 3.5.0.Now realising that was a trade-off I'm assuming there's a correlation there because my  Spyder IDE no longer launches neither does my Anaconda Navigator.I have already done a Spyder --reset command by the way no luck.How can I fix this issue while maintaining to use tensorflow?
403,.net - JScript.NET Design IDE ,I'm currently using JScript.NET for a small UI application. The problem is that my Visual Studio Express doesn't support JScript.NET for designing the UI. Is there a free IDE that I can use to design my UI and produce valid JScript.NET code? I just need the IDE Design functionality to Design the application that's it. Currently what I'm doing is converting the very similar C# code that it generates over to JScript.NET but It's kind of getting annoying.I use the VS2008 c# for designerit seems to work OK... i create the Form Design inside VS2008 for c# i get to the source the designer crated... Copy and paste into my JScript... then i have to change the VARsex c# jscript i also check the output on compile. just to fix any other conversion problems So there doesn't seem to be ANY JScript.NET IDE out there. If you're just looking to design your application you can just produce the C# or whatever code for the UI and generate a  out of that. Then you can use that dll from you JScript.NET code. This is what I'm doing and it works great... it's awesome how you can share dlls across different languages! Loving .NET!
404,IDE for debugging 'C source in linux ,Recently I am developing using 'C in Linux platforms the tools like gcc are fast. But I wish it would be great to have an IDE like the VC++ IDE for windows.There are Eclipse CDT () both great IDEs with pretty much same features as Visual Studio.If you are starting developing for Linux and Windows you might want to get a deep look into CMake ( (from my desktop). That's a slightly old version so I'm sure the interface offers more by now. CodeBlocks and Anjuta are pretty fair enough as pointed out by Brian Campbell
405,smalltalk - alternative IDE for squeak/pharo ,"I've been using smalltalk for a while now and I love the language and the concept. What I just hate is the System browser. This tool doesn't even resemble a modern IDE. How am I supposed to code without tabs outlines and handy shortcuts? I often find myself implementing a selector and noticing that it would be nice to isolate a piece of code in a separate (private) selector just for readability shake but I don't. Because it takes like 5 mouse clicks and I have to navigate away from the selector I am working at and navigate back to it. Oh wait I can't! Because it has syntax errors because I haven't finished it yet! Kills me. And I don't have a 24 inch display to open 3 browsers. Sorry for a little rant. My question is is there a real IDE (Eclipse Net.Beans VS) for smalltalk? Maybe for some commercial version of smalltalk?Historically the real ""IDE"" is the Smalltalk one and one could claim that the others are just an adaptation to the limits of traditional textual programming languages (not rethorical just check out the evolution of typical development environment UIs and how they are adding features that exists in Smalltalk from the very beggining like the senders and references in VS). Just a side note: actually more than 2000 open-source projects in the  has an IDE called CodeMonkey for writing Smalltalk applications.  It's not specifically for Squeak and instead uses their own smalltalk implementation but it may be worth looking into.  Unfortunately it's only available in their SVN repository so it's a pain to compile and install."

409,Selenium IDE gotoIf javascript syntax ,I want to use selenium IDE 1.10.0  I am using the flow control plugin 1.0.4 that provides extra commands including gotoIf. Downloaded from IDE plugins on   I have tried the following expressions: All throw the same error: Any ideas?Thanks Pete  I have been unable to get flow control IDE plugin to work. At Michael's suggestion I tried the sideflow.js user extension instead. With sideflow.js I have tried the following expressions: All throw the same error: But the following expressions work fine: It seems there is an issue around the == operator...Selenium IDE doesn't provide a way to act on a value (if else) you will need to run WebDriver and use the programming language to provide that functionality.  However in IDE you can stop the test if the values are not equal by using any of the  and IDE will flag the evaluation depending on the result and the test will continue as normal. if you just need to compare two variables then use command verifyExpression storeValue|id=id1|var1 storeValue|id=id2|var2 verifyExpression|${var1}|${var1} if two variables matches then no error will throw if not error will throw. Thank you Note the single quotes around both the variable and the text.  This took me a while also.Not sure however if you need to use the javascript piece how it needs to be formatted. I believe runscript has to be used after each store variable request.  I may be wrong but it seems to me this is what actually triggers the call to the sideflow.js to execute its functions.  I'm inferring this from my own trial and errors attempting to solve my issues.For integers the following code worked for me.  with == it evaulated true and went to the correct label.

417,svn - How to Integrate TortoiseSVN with Eclipse IDE? ,I have always used  instead of Notepad++. I did a checkout to my SVN repository with TortoiseSVN and now I want to import the SVN project (a >) into Eclipse and commit files to SVN repository directly from Eclipse IDE.How can i accomplish this? Thanks for help!You need to install an SVN Plugin. I would recommend Subversive you can find it in the Eclipse Marketplace ( and configure your SVN repository. Now you can make all SVN operations directly from Eclipse and there is no need to use TortoiseSVN anymore. The easiest is to use a SVN plugin for eclipse such as Subclipse - . Once installed you would not have any dependency to TortoiseSVN.  Also note that if you wish to use both Subclipse and TortoiseSVN on the same files on your file system your working copy format version supported by the respective clients must be the same. There is a plugin which allows simple usage of Tortoise SVN (and also Beyond Compare) in Eclipse: The 2 Phase Installation instructions are provided in the Eclipse site which I followed to install Tortoise SVN in my Eclipse Luna.I followed the Phase I - Option 1 and Phase 2 which worked well for me. 
418,Lightweight Java IDE that Maintains Indentation? ,"Whenever I am debugging a java program I have to have the code indented! And I hate to manually indent code one by one (using Tab). I would really like a lightweight Java IDE that automatically indents ALL your code at a push of a button. A good example is ""Ready To Program"" Java IDE but the downside to this IDE is that it is not compatible with JDK 1.5+  Are there any suggestions on such a Java IDE? to properly format/indent your Java code.  It's even got a handy shortcut:  Edit: Oh yeah Netbeans is great but not really lightweight... In the good old days I used to use emacs as an ""IDE"" for Java development.  It has excellent support for code indentation and formatting. Coding Java in NPP must be similar experience to shaving yourself with blunt stone and using vodka instead of aftershave. It may look manly but there's no reason. It's XXI century. Intellij will run on any reasonable PC same with NetBeans and Eclipse. Those features are no-brainer for me along with about hundred of others. Build in debugger with ability to execute any piece of code or checking variable state are also necessary. I know that most of debugger may be replaced with good suite of unit tests however sometimes you just need to check something live. And as we are on topic of unit tests even that is possible to simplify with good IDE. Intellij allows you to navigate between class and test class run single test whole class or suite with simple key stroke generate test method from template etc. If you live from writing code then don't do it to yourself and just buy a license or use open version. Life is to short to work on NPP with plugins. Disclaimer: Vim is okay if you have to reconfigure something on live system in order to save a lot of $$$ c's it'll take time to deploy new version. In any other case using advanced notepad is just stupid. Why? For same reason as coding not on decent hardware but on OLPC.  "
419,Delphi IDE begin-end pair indicator ,In Delphi IDE brackets () are easy to match together because the IDE highlights the matching pair when clicked.

422,iced coffeescript - IDE for IcedCoffeeScript programming? ,What IDE can I use to develop IcedCoffeeScript code with syntax highlight and intellisense?  I tried to use Webstorm but it does not support IcedCoffeeScript.You can't have more than syntax checking/coloring and snippets with (iced)CoffeeScript (on any IDE) because the way the language operate. So intellisense is out of game. Many environments supports autocomplete who can help. note: all editors can have different kinds of autocomplete features with or without packages(extensions).
423,Delphi IDE Line Length ,In Delphi 7 IDE do the lines need to be a given length? I see a gray line in some Delphi code I'm working with and it looks like ever line ends right before it.It's just a guide to line length. Some people don't like long lines because they can be hard to read on different resolutions or when doing comparisons.  It's called the > groupbox. The margin is a visual assistent. The standard position is 80 characters which defaults to the maximum unscrolled size of many source formatting output media such as the one used here at Stack Overflow. Originally it had something to do with the paper width on (matrix) printers. Maybe it still does.
424,c# - Delegates and VisualStudio IDE ,I have the following code on a control of my own: I thought the IDE would recognize this delegate and allow me to choose a suitable already implemented function or create a new one if I wanted just like it does to events although at least at first glance that does not seem to be the case. Is there a way to set a function to a delegate through the IDE?no there is not use event if you want to use that feature
425,cross compiling - Multiple IDE project files ,We are currently working in a team where we use both Visual Studio and Code::Blocks is there a way to replicate changes between those project files? So if one adds a file to the project file it will also get adjusted in the project file of the other IDE? Please note: We want our project to work on multiple IDE's platforms and compilers. Thus a general solution is welcome too.I assume you're using a VCS? If so my intuition would be to write a script that syncs up your project files (based on modification date?) and run it as a checkin hook if any of the project files are changed in the commit. . CMake uses it's own syntax (which is fairly complex though still easier than autotools in my opinion) which is used with project file generators which supports make visual studio codeblocks eclipse and possibly others.  It also has a installer generator which can make NSIS installers Mac OS X bundles and debian/red hat packages (and again possibly others) which I find quite useful.

We are developping with Python (and Java but at this time let's speak about Python only ;) ) Working with Vim (for example) I want to use code completion but because the entire libs are installed in container my vim installation on host cannot access them. This is true with Java Javascript and so on and it's absolutly normal... But is there any solution to be able to work with container getting access to libs for IDE without to install IDE in the container itself ?But is there any solution to be able to work with container getting  access to libs for IDE without to install IDE in the container itself  ? The trick is to run your IDE from the container. Your IDE is installed on your host you just run it in the container.  For this to work you need an  container that has: An example of all this with a well known Python IDE instead of vim is discussed here: Warning: this has been validated on Ubuntu 14.04 only.  Why don't you checkout the official image for python? It doesn't provide exactly what you're looking for but it supports a workflow where the container is built the same way as it should be run on your development machine (dependencies listed in the ""requirements.txt"" and downloaded using pip). Hope this helps. You may also try using cloud-based IDEs like eclipse che or cloud9. It has support for docker and runs in a browser. Update:I just found out that eclipse che and cloud9 are not mature enough to run java apps so you might want to try Intellij: "
432,C++ IDE detecting syntax errors without recompilation? ,I work on Code::Blocks IDE on Windows. Great amount of time is wasted for code recompilation to find errors.Is there a C++ IDE that detects syntax errors without recompilation? I suppose any clang-based IDE would be an option?Microsoft Visual Studio with it's IntelliSense. You'd be surprised at how efficient Qt Creator is at detecting C++ errors before compilation. Give it a try! Eclipse has that awesome feature for Java but IIRC the CDT framework is not as powerful: it detects only vague syntax errors. Microsoft's VisualStudio which is available for free with the Express edition is very good if you are on Windows. Apple's XCode is pretty good but it gives up after only one error it's error messages are very short and cryptic and I believe it is only available on Mac OS X. Unfortunately I do not know of an IDE with this support for Linux. Configure code blocks to work with clang. Working fine for me.

435,c# - Efficient IDE tools for F#? ,I recently initiated my first F# project using Visual Studio 2012. I was rather surprised (or more precisely disappointed) at the lack of IDE support for F#. For example the classic Ctrl-r Ctrl-r shortcut for refactor rename appears to be completely absent. I installed the F# powertools extension which does provide some support for this - but apparently only supports renaming in the F# part of the solution and not e.g. C# parts of the solution (the solution contains both F# and C# projects). Are there extensions to Visual Studio which provides cross-language refactor rename functionality?

439,java - Terminal based IDE ,I'm looking for a IDE that supports java and is based over terminal. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and it doesn't have any gui installed and I'd prefer to keep it that way. However I'd also like to code on it and connect to it from other computers using SSH to code on there to provide a lightweight and fast IDE. It has to be able to edit compile and test Java on the spot and more languages if possible. It would be nice if it had support for multiple projects and had a collapsible project browser like in netbeans and most IDE's. Does anyone know anything that meets the requirements? I'd love something like  however thats only for android. is the only example I can think of. You might be able to get along with vim but there will be a lot of  shell calls.

This will force it to inspect the files and recompile.

442,ruby - Rails -- IDE Recommendations ,  I am looking for a good IDE for Ruby on Rails with the following qualifications: Works on a Windows PC (if it doesn't then it's not going to help me) Good auto-completion (for both classes provided by default (or by gem) for ruby and rails as well as for my own user-defined classes). Good syntax highlighter - most IDEs have solid syntax highlighting (I currently use Notepad++ and it does the trick relatively well) but I would really like for the syntax highlighter to detect which language to highlight in for the Rails views (highlight HTML in general JS inside  tags and Ruby inside ERB tags) - Notepad++ doesn't have that capability which makes the views that contain ERB JS and HTML a little difficult to read. Good debugger that runs when I execute my RoR app locally. If you know of any good IDEs out there that meet as many of these qualifications as possible that are relatively cheap that would be great!  If it is totally worth purchasing (i.e. RubyMine looks good but $69 is kind of expensive for an IDE when Notepad++ does work acceptably) then I can stomach the cost.  Thanks in advance!Actually as a Rails enthusiast myself. I strongly recommend Rubymine. Rubymine has a pretty neat debugger and I would say does a decent job of auto-completion. Give it a shot I think you'd like it. If you do end up using it try out   I've been using Netbeans I think Netbeans a good idea.  Eclipse sometime sucks with the different versions of Ruby runtime.

It seems like Demandware UX Studio is only for Eclipse? Any help or suggestions is much appreciated.In theory you can use your editor of choice to edit Demandware ISML files and DW Script files such as Sublime or JetBrains but you would need some kind of WebDAV-Sync solution to automatically upload your files to the server.  You'll also lose debugging when you move away from Eclipse. Editing pipelines will also be quite challenging as you won't have the visual IDE to edit the files (which are basically just XML). Fortunately there has been some movement in the community and a plugin has been created for Jetbrains it is available here:

Does it make sense to delete my ""regular"" Eclipse IDE for Java developers? I mean is there a feature in the regular IDE which isn't included in the EE IDE?  (I also use eclipse for Python programming with the Pydev plugin). The different ""editions"" of the eclipse IDE are basically just a different set of plugins on top of the basic eclipse platform. So if anything is missing you can alyways install those plugins when you need them. Yes it is a super-set. Also have you tried ? It has better GUI better javadoc support and it is way cooler to use! (and free) Not everyone needs the EE tools (mainly WTP - web tools platform); they may only be doing client apps or writing eclipse plugins."

My question is how to configure that eclipse based IDE so that it automatically puts some code when ever i tried to create a new workstep in the process. I am learning new things and I do not know where to start. I have gone through the folders where the IDE is installed and all I can find is jar files. could you please guide me as to where to start looking and any tips to get started. Thank you.you can use BPM studio (An Eclipse version savvion provided) where you can build process template as well as customize existing one.

I added the library to my project by importing jar from IDE.  As you can see in the image it shows me parameter names as srg0 arg1.. However in the source code of the library in github it uses different variable names such as P N r. I have observed in some cases IDE shows the same name that is used in the source. I am curious on how IDE shows parameter name in such cases. How does the IDE pick parameter names to show here?Either the references class would have had to be compiled using the -parameter compiler flag (see )Or you need to attach the source of the library to the library jar

466,linux - non-IDE C development environment ,"How do I set up a non-IDE-based C development environment on Linux?gcc + make + vi and you will live happily ever after! A pretty good development environment is most likely already there--no setup necessary.  This is because most Linux installations are  GCC. If I have to code on the command line I'd probably go with vi or nano over emacs I just can't cope with emacs anymore. Okay someone's gotta say it: Emacs gcc and make. If - as a commenter suggested - you're looking for instructions on setting this up there's probably no set up needed as most Linux distributions I've used come with these programs already installed. If you're not a masochist: gcc + cmake + nano ;) Make sure to edit your .nanorc file (you can copy an example from /etc/nanorc generally) Emacs + Cedet is the best I use gtkemacs gcc make but more often scons these days. This question is dangerously close to inciting religious wars.  Let me get it started: All configurations other than mine are inferior. I would recommend gcc + vim/vi + (make).  Vim/vi is almost impossible to ""just pick up and use"" because it will be completely foreign and you will struggle to even move the cursor or insert text but fortunately Vim comes with an extremely helpful tutor you can start by invoking the command > in the shell. It will get you up and running in no time!

471,How do I make my PHP IDE understand Dependency Injection Containers? ,Current situation: I have dependencies in my project that I solve by using dependency injection. I want to take the next logic step by using a dependency injection container (DIC) to ease the management of my dependencies and to lazy-load classes. I looked at  ran some test and really appreciate how DIC’s work. I’d probably go for Pimple because of its simplicity and raw power. If I didn’t have this problem: Due to the abstraction that DIC’s offer the IDE I’m using (PHPStorm) no longer understands what’s going on in my code. It doesn’t understand that $container['mailer'] or $sc-&gt;mailer is holding a class object. I also tried Netbeans IDE: same problem. This is really a problem for me because my IDE becomes useless. I don’t want to program without code hints autocompletion and refactoring tools when dealing with classes. And I don’t want my IDE to find all kinds of false positives when validating code. So my question is: Has anyone dealt with this problem and found a solution?You can define class of the variable 'manually': In PhpStorm (and by  which can read that file and open the autocomplete with the service names and its type (class string and etc). I'm using those two components and I can say that are good options for auto completion for Silex/Pimple. Pimple just introduce container builder principe. If you understand it you don't need Pimple any more: This way Pimple does not hide type of object in mixed $c['some key']. You would have autocomplete suggestions when edit your container. Phpstorm is able to autoresolve method return type from your code. And you would have clear container.  You can ever override container: To be honest container written in 'programming' lanuage is wrong way to go. Container responsibility is to bring initialized graph of objects to caller. Having access to 'programming language' allows to violate that responsibility with easy. Some DSL for configuring dependency is better. Moreover most of original dependency information (argument typehints of constructors) is just ignored by Pimple and sfDepenencyContainer making your configuration bloated and fragile.

If we don't actually run the app just the IDE then it works fine and we can quit the IDE itself normally. Anyone seen this before? Any ideas? Thanks!This is most definately caused by leaks of VB6 objects that are involved in subclassing/hooking and not only these. What we did to get rid of these crashes was to instrument all of our classes (including forms user controls designers and anything that can be instantiated) with  debug print statement the call-stack shows you exactly the offenting property of the offending UC. I believe  is correct in its technical assessment of the cause of the problem. But it may also be useful to briefly describe the procedure I used to narrow down the source lines of code. In my case this problem appeared to be TOTALLY random so it was hard to know where to start. My approach was not rocket science - more brute force. Essentially I used a binary search to rule in/out sections of code. First step was to comment out the entire startup procedure so that the app would start as an empty shell; this demonstrated that the problem went away (null result). Following that I recursively commented in roughly half the code testing for the problem each time. Each block was evaluated as a boolean - it either did or did not cause the problem. Then proceed again in the block not ruled out. Eventually (and more quickly than I anticipated) this led to a single line of code which accessed a property of a third-party control."
480,debugging - How to debug Delphi IDE? ,"What are the detailed steps on how to debug the Delphi IDE? I understand from other posts that one needs to create a project and in the project's debugger settings set the project's ""host application"" to Delphi (). Then when the project is run in the debugger (by pressing the Your project is most likely an EXE-type. EXE type projects don't need host applications so the setting is ignored no other IDE is started. At a minimum you should make your project a DLL-type: that will start the second IDE but it will not be very helpful. The technique you mentioned is usually used to debug your > code to set a breakpoint. I would first check if the hang occurs at run-time as well as at design-time.  Instantiate the component dynamically in your run-time code.  If the hang sstill occurs then you can step through the component's source code normally using a single debugger instance.  You do not need to debug into a running IDE instance unless the behavior only occurs within the IDE process. First find and open the component packages turn both the runtime and designtime package build options from Release to Debug if they aren't already and rebuild. Then save a project group containing both the package projects (one designtime and one runtime in some exceptional cases people only have one package which is designtime+runtime in one). Then follow the steps to set BDS.exe as the Host Application. I would be tempted to add some  messages to the component that you know is broken: Constructor:  Destructor:  Finalization section of the unit that TMyComponent is in: Looking at the output Events page in the delphi debugger you can figure out how far the code got and even if you don't get an exception breakpoint that you can use to locate the flaw fairly accurately you can use either OutputDebugString messages like the above or you can even just set  in delphi and turn off the breakpoint property ""Break on exception"" and instead set up a ""log message"".  These messages (breakpoint messages) have the benefit of not requiring any damage to your component in order to add some simple ""print-statement-debug"" like capabilities to your debugging toolkit. If the second instance of Delphi is not launching then you have the path to bds.exe incorrect."

Addition subquestion: some people told me ""don't use OCamL it's a dead language for students with low libraries support and seems like dying use python or ruby instead"". But I like the beauty of OCamL. I want to give it a try. Tell me if that is normal to use OCamL for production code today? thank you.There is  as the first result.

489,Which programming languages require an IDE? ,"I was reading through an answer to a question about an IDE for Go that triggered this question. I was trying to think of a language that 'required' an IDE but could not come up with one.Many of the ""graphical languages"" more or less require an IDE. They aren't particularly popular at the moment but the general idea is a ""language"" where you create programs by drawing some sort of diagram.

490,eclipse - Java source code management with different IDE ,Is it necessary to use the same ide to program in java? For example I use IntelliJ to build a small java project about 2000 lines. Then the marker uses Eclipse IDE to mark this project. Does he need to import all the source code into a new project and set up everything for it?  I didn't use any add-on on this IDE. The reason I asked this question because I receive huge grade duction for using different IDE the prof response me and said marker need rebuild everything for using different ide.  I drag my source code into Eclipse and it works very well so I am confused am I right or wrong?
491,Autoformat Javascript in Netbeans IDE ,Are there any known Plugins or ways to properly autoformat Javascript in Netbeans IDE? After looking into this further I have found that the javascript module is being rewritten already(much needed).  You can finally find formatting options for javascript.  It's available in the netbeans nightly builds.  Good luck all.    You have to use an alternate key for now.  I'm working on modifying the Javascript language in Netbeans to possibly release something better later on(either as a plugin or patch).  I'm still familiarizing myself with the way things are happening in Netbeans.   There have been talks for years to add more formatting options for Javascript in Netbeans.  Nothing has surfaced.  I'm going to propose that the Javascript language leverage JSBeautify(running in Rhino) to provide formatting rather then implementing new features in Java.  This simplifies the formatting process plus the JSBeautify community is very large and it's actively developed.

493,eclipse - Fast and interactive PHP IDE? ,"  Could you recommend me a PHP IDE? I've tried Notepad++ (a great text editor but.. just a text editor) and NetBeans. I've worked with Eclipse on Java too. I like NetBeans but like Eclipse it is so damn slow. Recently it started lagging every 3 seconds or so.. Most important features are: Auto-tab auto-completion of opened functions HTML tags syntax highlight auto-generation of comments for functions function and class hints (it should be able to ""look"" into my classes and their methods like NetBeans). So basicaly I am looking for a NetBeans-like lightweight text editor :) Any ideas?I haven't tried it myself but I've heard many people raving about  which I would describe as a lightweight IDE.  It's not as feature-laden as Netbeans/Eclipse but is quickly to its set with every update. vim on the other hand is as lightweight as it gets but by default probably doesn't have all the goodies you're looking for.  However if you're willing to spend the time configing and installing plugins you can make it whatever you want. I'd go for Netbeans but since you don't want it most programmers praised (and still praise)EMACS . Emacs is available for every platform. Some people consider it to be the best. Truth is that it is very fast auto-completion of your code and many other features. It takes a few days to get used to the powerful shortcuts but once you're done with it I guess you'll find it very smooth. You only need to install the application and activate the PHP plugin (or else if needed). Hope this helped. I have moved from Netbeans to PHPStorm and quite satisfied by features you can automate and so far it is much smarter on guessing what I'm typing.In my opinion Netbeans is more about Java programming and PHP feature behave as a little addon.Before Netbeans I was playing with PHPDesigner also nice and fast IDE for a reasonable price."
494,java - Netbeans IDE - Automatic Suggestion while typing ,hi i am using netbeans 7 IDE for java programming  and i am acutally a C# programmer and in visual studio whenever i type anything it displays a dropdown menu with suggestions  i want that to be enabled on netbeans IDE without having to press CTRL + Space to show the dropdown menu  thanks in advance .By default Netbeans gives suggestion only when you put a period (i.e. for class and object fields and methods). However you can customize auto-completion by going to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Editor &gt; Code Completion Choose whatever configuration works best for you. Hope this help! Make sure in the Code Assistance (e.g. Tools → Options → C/C++ → Code Assistance) in case of C/C++ you added your compiler's include directories. You can find the compiler you are using in Project Properties → Build → X Compiler a common response to your answer suggesting the automatic code completion in netbeans IDE is as follows
495,testing - How to loop tests in Selenium IDE? ,"I've been testing in Selenium IDE. It's pretty easy to use and I have created some test cases with it. I've been searching Google trying to find a way to repeat my tests automatically. I've seen a solution with gotolabel while loops etc. But I couldn't make any of them works. Can someone give me a tip on how to loop my test  times or loop forever. I appreciate any help. Do this: The js file provides goto gotoIf and while loop functionality in Selenium IDE. The example below shows a simple loop:   as stated in the answer above install the user extension which will add loop functionality to Selenium IDE tests. The example below shows a simple loop: I'm new to Selenium (just started using it a few minutes ago). After a quick Google search for ""selenium loop"" this stackoverflow.com question came up. I immediately jumped into the extension and started using loops. The accepted answer is very helpful. However I wanted to point out something else for others that are new to selenium (and stumble on this page). I created a simple test for a simple web page. I added a loop so that the test would run indefinitely (until I paused/stopped it). However I noticed that by doing this the Runs/Failures counters within the Selenium GUI do not increment with each loop (I am guessing because a single test case was never running to completion it was just looping indefinitely). So I dug a bit further. My goal was to leave the same test running for a long time (a few hours or possibly overnight) to see if there were any failures (I'm chasing an intermittent bug at the moment). The simplest way (for me after a few minutes of searching/experimenting) was to do the following (likely no plugins needed although the attached plugin is definitely helpful if you want to run a few small loops within a test case): Now I have the same simple test suite running many times and the Runs/Failures counters are incrementing as expected (without the need for any loops). Use the . After restarting Firefox use the  command to jump there. For example: There are other commands that you can see on the plug-in page and documented in the To loop forever just replace  with an extremely large number that will take centuries to execute which probably is as good as forever if you are running Selenium IDE. Selenium IDE now has flow control. These Control Flow commands work by specifying opening and closing commands to denote a set (or block) of commands.  Here are each of the available control flow commands accompanied by their companion and/or closing commands. if else if else endtimes enddo repeat ifwhile end You can read more about it here:  This is a sample for sampcop user in order to automate spam complaints using label and goto Label commands: 1st Login on spamcop.net  2nd use Report Spam option 3rd start this script Your test suite file is just an HTML file so just do the following: "
