"['Nov 19, 2015']","Personally I think this is a bad idea. Making the editor a kitchen sink is how we will make it slow and bloated. Besides, the amount of work necessary to get on par with just the basic features of excellent terminals out there (e.g. iTerm2, ConEmu) would be huge.I know not everyone runs OS X but check out my setup below. I'm using El Capitan's full screen features to place VS Code side by side with iTerm2. I am super happy with it.",
"['Nov 19, 2015']","@joaomoreno but some people want coding, and just use CLT when deploy app. Maybe you can make a extension like term3, then the native version of VSCode won't run slowly.",

"['Mar 7, 2016']",As an extension I agree but not integrated in to the editor itself.Ultimately I would like to see a terminal extension that gives multi terminal capabilities like web storm does.I think the goal should be to get vscode extensible enough that someone can do extensions like this.i.e. able to add\extend panels with tabs\sidebars etc..I find ctrl+shift+c is doing the job ok for now (minus the part that I cant choose which terminal program it launches),
"['Mar 8, 2016']","I find ctrl+shift+c is doing the job ok for now (minus the part that I cant choose which terminal program it launches)@pflannery That's a problem too, and I think it should be solved in first place. In Xfce there is no gnome-terminal, and I could be probably using better terminals even on Windows/OSX (hypothetically), so having a config option to select which terminal I want to launch would be good enough for me. Built-in terminal = reinventing the wheel.",
