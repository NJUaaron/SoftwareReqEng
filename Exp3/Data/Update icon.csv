"May 21, 2016","I use this customized icon by Santiago Ramos Panalés, and would like to petition for to be made the official Visual Studio Code icon on Mac OS X. I have not asked the artists permission before submitting this feature request.It looks fantastic and follows [Apples OS X Human Interface Guidelines], while the current icon looks out of place in both the dock and the application launcher.Images for comparison:",
"May 26, 2016","@lyret thank you for the suggestion!  we are actually working on a new icon for VS Code, we'll take this design into consideration.",
"Apr 4, 2017","Thumbs up for this. I recently switched from Atom and Sublime to VSCode. I like everything else, but the app icon is ugly and also too bland. The app icon is easily missed while switching app with cmd-tab. I don't know why, but possibly because of the ""blandness"".",
"Apr 15, 2017",I recently did this. ,
"Jul 7, 2017","This is the original, still open icon issue... I'm going to resolve all other icon issues against this one.",
"Jul 7, 2017","Changing title to reflect that we need a new icon for all platforms, not just MacOS",
"Aug 2, 2017",@chrisdias assigning this to august milestone since I do not think we are doing anything regarding this in this milestone.,
"Aug 4, 2017","Not trying to spam people, but given how many issues created on this and how long this has been open, hope we don't need to wait for multiple months still for it to happen!",
"Aug 7, 2017",we're working on it.... :-),

"Aug 16, 2017",@sldobri 's icon seems a bit bigger than the original design in #17066. It's also bigger than other mac app icons. Would love to make sure the final design can have the same size as other icons :) I think the size of the current icon is a major thing that bothers me (other than it being too flat).,"['https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/17066', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/17066']"
"Aug 23, 2017","Stable Mac, Windows/LinuxInsiders The ""Iterations on infinity"" blog post does a good job explaining how we arrived at the latest Visual Studio family of icons, along with many of the challenges. For VS Code specifically, we took our time to iterate on a number of ""editor"" related symbols before pivoting to a subset of the infinity symbol. We feel that the icon denotes ""openness"". It conveys that VS Code is (in a good way) a subset of  our big brother, the Visual Studio IDE. And, if you look hard enough, you'll find a small tribute to a great mind.The new icons will appear in Insiders shortly and will be in Stable when we release the August iteration in early September.",
"Oct 24, 2017","we are changing the orange to blue, you can read more here: https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theicon","['https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theicon', 'https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theicon']"
"Oct 24, 2017","Much prefer the blue, but really don't like the card background. Also none tilted would be better for me.After seeing a comment above, I can't unsee the shark eating the small fish. ;-)",
"Oct 24, 2017","summary: ""fish being eaten by a shark"" icon stays. color reverts.i personally believe that is the wrong call. godspeed.",
"Oct 24, 2017","Uhm, I better liked the orange one (or green for insiders) than this one.Anyone else has Atom-like icon for insiders version?",
"Oct 25, 2017",@darkocolak this is a completely separate issue... see #36665,"['https://github.com/darkocolak', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/36665', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/36665']"
"Oct 25, 2017",@darkocolak Atom-like iconthis is the generic Electron icon btw,
"Oct 26, 2017",I like @donysukardi version colored in blue:Even though it feels a bit lost in the dock:A recolored straightened version of the shipped one in blue is not bad:I for now ended up using the recolored version in blue for the time being as proposed in the blogpost (https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theicon):Looks fine in the dock:,"['https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theicon', 'https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theicon']"
"Oct 26, 2017",Why confine infinity in the box? Aren't we thinking outside the box? On the other hand people no longer buy DVD boxes so let us free the infinity !,
"Nov 9, 2017",Orange was very confusing with sublime 's logo. Blue is way better!,
"Nov 9, 2017","I started using this one https://dribbble.com/shots/3168520-Visual-Studio-Code-Icon-Replacement but the blue version of it.For MacOS makes more sense than the one that is right now. And to be fair, the logo looks too much of an adobe family products. I really don't like that vibe.I am hoping that you are going to make something more elegant and simple. Your infinity symbol is distinctive enough.",
"Nov 9, 2017",Blue is back in 1.18!https://youtu.be/YVkUvmDQ3HY?t=32s,
"Nov 9, 2017","Folks, can we just put this issue to rest already?There was no such thing as original Visual Studio Code icon. It was and always have been just the Visual Studio icon in a different color. Just think of it as the price to pay for having a team of people work on open source project and have Microsoft pay for it. The only thing they get out of it is marketing value. Let them have it. Microsoft is a huge corp, and changing icons is a company wide effort. Once they settle on something each team only has a small amount of room to change things within provided guidelines.In this case all they can do is change the infinity sign to the left of the hook or change the color. That's it.They changed the color back to blue, which is a good thing in my book, because it makes it easier to tell them apart form Sublime new icon.If you are going to come up with new design, save your trouble and design it within new Visual Studio theme.I do like the old icon better, but it makes it easier for me to accept the new icon knowing that it helps color blind people to tell VS Code from regular Visual Studio and other similarly branded products. With the old icon color used to be the only differentiating factor.Here is how Microsoft came up with new icon, and VS Code team had to work within that: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/03/08/iterations-on-infinity/Here is how VS Code landed on the current icon: https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theiconIf you don't like it, just change it for yourself to whatever you want, it's very easy to do: https://www.alexkras.com/restoring-original-visual-studio-code-icon/","['https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theicon', 'https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theicon']"
"Nov 9, 2017",@akras-apixio no,
"Nov 9, 2017",everyone here knows that microsoft has a right to do what it wants.we're just saying it is unpleasant to look at no matter the color.if i could replace it like ppl are doing on the macOS i would unsubscribe from this issue :(,
"Nov 9, 2017",@orenmizr you change the icon on any platform ,
"Nov 9, 2017",@wilomgfx i am not talking about changing the shortcut icon. i am talking about replacing the application's icns equivalent of window10,
"Nov 9, 2017",As the original reporter I feel like this is issue is resolved - the new icon is designed in accordance with the Apple Interface guidlknes; it might not be to everyone liking but if you dont have any productive feedback you should not be making comments on the issue tracker.,
"Nov 9, 2017",bring back orange.color blind and can't tell the difference b/w VS Code and VS 2017,
"Nov 11, 2017",I like the icon design.  I would say maybe a more teal color than straight blue.,
"Nov 11, 2017",That sounds nice.,
"Nov 13, 2017","While you're not going to win, as everybody has an opinion. Blue really does stand out:",
"Nov 13, 2017","Just add tintColor to VS Code preferences and do some canvas magic to generate the correct icon, everyone can have their own color ",
"Nov 14, 2017","Thanks for changing it to blue, no further changes needed.",
"Nov 15, 2017","Don't you know the saying ""Haters gonna hate""?People who are disliking something are complaining more in comments. There are FAR MORE people who LIKE IT on the other side... but these guys don't comment because it's fine for them.Damn, orange was just fine!",
"Nov 15, 2017","Please don't listen to the guys which are complaining about the tilted Mac icon with background card. It looks great and blends in with other tilted system icons (notes, mail, pages, contacts, etc.)The plain Windows icon without background card is just boring ugly! @Haters: Build some confidence in trusting designers and stop this stupid discussion  ",
"Nov 15, 2017","@hoobtron The main reason why the icon is ugly is not the color, but the shape that makes it indistinguishable. Orange color just emphasizes the crappiness of this icon. Sure, the orange can look good for another shape (Sublime, WinAmp etc.). If you find this discussion stupid, then just skip it and trust the designers (or people who pretend to be designers).",
"Nov 15, 2017","@alexanderby: indistinguishable to what? A shape of its own is distinguishable just by that.A modern presentation and professional execution is important to an icon... that's given (at least for the Mac version). Symbol shape and a single color (not color combinations) is (to an highly grade) just personal taste and subjective conception!I'm fine with the distinguishable symbol and the single (blue, orange, whatever) color (if it's complementary to the color of the background card).. now leave it that way and keep the icon design.",
"Nov 16, 2017","I don't think you're playing favorites, but it feels like there's the icon for Windows and the icon for Not windows. Can Linux have it's own icon or, at the very least, not the Mac version. I don't understand why there are multiple versions. And I really don't understand why one of them is leaning.",
"Nov 16, 2017","MacOS icons standard is to have a tilt. Now the reason why the MacOS icondifferent, I don't actually know nor understand either.
