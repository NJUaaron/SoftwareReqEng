"Mar 23, 2016",Sorry for the delayed response on this issue.  We use blue within the status bar because it's consistent within the family of Visual Studio.  We may in the future open this and other things to customization via user style sheets.  Hopefully that will address any concerns you have with the color.,

"May 8, 2016","@bgashler1 I understand your desire to default to aligning with the VS branding, but the color is extremely distracting for some people. It would be great if you could at least have a user style sheet that would allow us to dim it down, or just set it to always be black.

"Jul 8, 2016",Really ? Distractive ? Are you not able to drive your eyes ? Never seen an issue for an IDE so stupid,
"Jul 8, 2016",@be5invis Where is this file located?,
"Jul 10, 2016",+1 Whilst I personally don't find it a distraction as such - I dislike that when making the editor fullscreen (F11) it's the only thing that stops the editor feeling completely seamless (for lack of a better word). Try loading the Atom editor in dark theme and make that fullscreen. It looks completely seamless. VSCode would look just as good (if not better) if it wasn't for this out of place blue bar at the bottom.,
