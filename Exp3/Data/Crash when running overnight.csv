"['Dec 9, 2015']","This seems to happen consistently every night I leave the computer running. It looks like it's unresponsive due to the CPU being maxed out. Maybe some infinite loop is somewhere, perhaps to do with file or git repo polling?",
"['Dec 9, 2015']",I wonder if the OS decides to put VSCode (Electron actually) into a state where it is causing this crash. I have pinged Electron if they have a clue.,

Just about every day I'd log in to find my VSCode windows left overnight have all crashed (with the standard uninformative/apologetic crash error, ""Visual Studio Code has crashed"").Today, after the 0.10.5 update, I had my first crash while I was there - unfortunately not while I was actively using it.Running VSCode on Windows 7 (64-bit), primarily using it as a JS editor on a very large project - nearly a million lines total (including libs I need to search, so are not excluded). No performance issues in normal use and I didn't notice any excessive resource usage leading up to today's crash.I'd be happy to provide more detailed error logs/info if someone can point me to them.",

"['Jan 4, 2016']","Ubuntu 12.04, vscode 0.10.5 could not reproduce leaving it over the weekend with an empty instance.",
"['Jan 4, 2016']","It may well be a subtle memory leak, made apparent by the relatively high memory utilisation on this system.I left the computer at about 5:30 PM, with system memory commit slowly creeping up - it was 15,402 MB at 7:00 PM. At 3:09 AM was the closest approach to the system commit limit (17,682 MB), and commit usage dropped from 16,218 MB to 15,217 MB. I suspect this might be where VSCode crashed. Commit usage was stable around there until logging stopped around 6 AM (out of disk space - those performance counters are big!).Unfortunately I did not include all the VSCode processes so I do not have process-specific logging. I will try that tonight.Would be very useful if I could get the time of crash. Does VSCode leave logs anywhere?",
"['Jan 5, 2016']","Unfortunately I did not include all the VSCode processes so I do not have process-specific logging. I will try that tonight.That would be super useful, thanks!Currently vscode does not log to disk.",
"['Jan 5, 2016']",@Elusive138 can you share the workspace you let vscode running on?,
"['Jan 5, 2016']","@bpasero Unfortunately not. It is based on Ext JS, though, and that's where the majority of the (library) code is. I'll try a clean Ext JS workspace after this other testing is done, and see if it repros there.",
"['Jan 5, 2016']",@Elusive138 yes would be good to have a sample to reproduce on our end.,
"['Jan 5, 2016']","One of the code.exe processes (code#3 in the log, attached) seems to be leaking. Commit started at about 200 MB at 5:30 PM, and reached 460 MB by 9:00 AM the next day, with a constant increase:Handle count does not go up.vscode_memleak.zipThere was no crash this time, perhaps because I did not have as many other memory-intensive programs running. Might be able to test this in a VM with a low commit limit later.This log was created overnight with 3 large workspaces open in different windows. I'll try to narrow it down to a workspace I'm able to share.",
"['Jan 6, 2016']",@Elusive138 it would be helpful to understand the details of the process that leaks. Can you find its PID and then print its full meta data using ps aux | grep &lt;pid&gt;?,

"['Jan 6, 2016']",Ah... this isn't even the really bad one. The second-level code.exe below it was worse.4772 was the process that leaked overnight. The other one seems to have risen up due to my use during the day... I think.,
"['Jan 6, 2016']",@Elusive138 this looks like you have multiple windows open with Code is that true?,
"['Jan 6, 2016']","@bpasero Yes, the test last night had three windows open with different workspaces. I'll be trying it tonight with just one, on a clean Ext JS workspace as mentioned above.",
"['Jan 6, 2016']",Sounds good!,
"['Jan 6, 2016']","Unfortunately, no repro... this is odd. What could be causing a leak within that specific project?Speaking of which, this might be different from @Tyriar's initial issue. His was unresponsive, mine and gwynjudd are crashes with the error dialog..? In which case maybe we should make a new issue...",
"['Jan 7, 2016']","@Elusive138 odd. does it reproduce if you just open that workspace without opening any JS file?Also, maybe we can start profiling this using the chrome developer tools where you can do heap snap shots. For that, just do a snapshot before and after some time to see where those memory goes.",
"['Jun 8, 2016']","Our new insiders release is out (http://code.visualstudio.com/Download#insiders) and includes our work for tabs/stacks.
