"Jul 20, 2016","VSCode 1.3.1 crashes about twice a day for me, once overnight (always) and sometimes randomly during the day. It just crashed now while I had it open in the background, not using it for about 2 hours. Also upon opening vscode again it loses my workspace, and I have to re-open the project folder it had open before the crash. Tabs and splits are preserved after re-opening the folder.",
"Aug 2, 2016","i left open in the background for a while with unsaved changes, came back, started typing and vscode froze for a few seconds then crashed. it lost my work.I hope you can understand my frustration. This is unacceptable for an editor. Also the session it restored didn't even have the right tabs open, nor my place in each tab.",
"Aug 6, 2016",@delvarworld can you share more details about your working environment? can you try to run with extensions disabled to see if that helps?,
"Aug 12, 2016","I have this same issue on Linux Mint 17 Qiana (cant remember which version of ubuntu that is!). It just froze for me after ~2 hours of inactivity. I'll remember to check memory/CPU usage next time it happens, though I have never noticed a general slowdown in other apps etc when this happens.VSCode info:Version 1.4.0Commit 6276dcbDate 2016-08-04T16:49:32.489ZShell 0.37.6Renderer 49.0.2623.75Node 5.10.0",
"Oct 10, 2016","This issue has gone away for me (on 1.5.3, Windows 7) - given the last comment is 2 months ago is this maybe resolved?",
"Oct 12, 2016",I haven't seen this occur for me in ages either. I've been using the current release for months. SeemsGood,
"Oct 13, 2016",Same. Doesn't seem to overload at all.,
"Oct 13, 2016","Ok, we should continue in individual issues and avoid monster bugs like this one that are hard to track. If anyone is still seeing this issue, please file new issues with more details. PLEASE avoid hijacking an existing issue ",
"Oct 26, 2016","I also remember seeing this before and haven't seen it in ages, so, that's my verification.",
