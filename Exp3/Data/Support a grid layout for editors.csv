I think it's more intuitive.","['https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/June', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/224', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/224', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1749', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1749']"
"['Nov 3, 2016']",@Tekbr what is wrong with our approach?,
"['Nov 3, 2016']","@bpasero I think it was not very clear. I'll try to explain better. Sorry for EnglishI enjoyed new in version 1.7, but it would be interesting to allow vertical and horizontal split at the same time.As shown in the gif, three tabs. A vertical split, horizontal split at the same time.Clicking a button (or use the shortcut) to change the orientation, it becomes a little boring.Just as we drag the tab to the side it adjusts the window, dragging down, near the lower edge of this window to adjust, without the need to use ""Toggle Editor Group Layout"".",
"['Nov 10, 2016']",I used the   but wanted to provide verbal support for this usecase as well. I have a rather large monitor on which I use Sublime in a 2x3 grid which currently is not possible in VS Code as you have to choose between horizontal vs vertical.,
"['Nov 20, 2016']","After finally implementing #1749, this is another needed step towards making the workbench as flexible as in other editors (Sublime Text, Atom, vim, Emacs, full Visual Studio - they all support grid layouts). Especially on larger screens, it is very useful to use 2×2 or 1+2 grid layouts. Some people with very large screens tend to use even more crazy layouts, which can be useful when working on projects that have multiple related files (e.g. header files in C++).Would be very lovely to have something like this in VS Code!","['https://camo.githubusercontent.com/45f206317d8a8aa62d9b8807e3dd6008a0ac2623/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f58766a39522e706e67', 'https://i.imgur.com/Xvj9R.png', 'https://camo.githubusercontent.com/45f206317d8a8aa62d9b8807e3dd6008a0ac2623/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f58766a39522e706e67']"
"['Nov 30, 2016']",I like to be able to split both vertically and horizontally and this is really missing here :(Hopefully it will be implemented. This is the only major problem I have with vscode right now.,
"['Dec 28, 2016']","+1I use WebStorm over VS Code for three reasons:Can't split horizontallyvim emulation is mediocre (but thanks anyway, it makes it usable at all)can't record keyboard macrosVS Code is really fast and I like that it's in JavaScript.  It has soooo much potential.  I'm sure it'll be my editor of choice when those things are implemented.To be clear, here's a screenshot of WebStorm menu (what I mean by horizontal split):",
"['Dec 30, 2016']","For me, Atom has it perfectly ... split up/down ... split left/right ... and you can end up with 4 quadrants, or 2 on the left and 1 on the right, or 1 on the left and 2 on the right, or even more if you like ... each with its own set of tabs. A newly opened file goes into the section with focus at the time of opening. I currently use all three cases on my 4K monitor.",
"['Jan 9, 2017']","I wonder why it was not implement yet, or maybe VS team has some justifications against horizontal split?",
"['Jan 9, 2017']","@whitecolor VSCode has horizontal split. You can enable it by pressing 'alt+shift+1' (toggles between vertical and horizontal splitting).However, I would definitely agree that a grid layout allowing a mismash of horizontal and vertical windows is needed in VSCode. In my office, I'm the only person consistently using VSCode and one of the outstanding reasons is the lack of grid layout capability.",
"['Jan 10, 2017']","Right you can switch vertical horizontal, but can't use both, it is kind of strange.",
"['Jan 31, 2017']","Is this going to be considered or should we just forget about it?To be honest it is the only real bad thing I see about vscode right now, but I want to use it everyday and it's quite painful not to be able to.I understand that time is not infinite, but I don't see much happening here so excuse me if I'm being annoying by upping this but I'd like this discussion to continue further :)",

"['Feb 22, 2017']",@andradei yes.,
"['Feb 23, 2017']","Also would love this. Arbitrary grid splitting is pretty central to my workflow. I'd love to switch to Code as it's amazing in other places but, this keeps holding me back. ",
"['Mar 3, 2017']",This is the number one reason some of my colleagues aren't on the vscode train,
"['Mar 4, 2017']","Definitely. It's an integral part of most emacs' users workflow to continuously redefine the buffer grid, using the C-x-&lt;n&gt; key combinations. I would say the number one use is to split once to obtain two views of the same buffer and quickly navigate to a different part for reference  – and then often unsplit shortly after.",
"['Mar 15, 2017']","I'm just trying to switch from Emacs, and not having that makes migration painful",
"['Mar 26, 2017']","Wow. I hate this. Any time you start some new software, play around a little and find something annoying, you go to open an issue – but it was either just resolved to be released in the next version, or discussion have been just finished that it needs to be done.Anyways. Playing with React-Native, after Android Studio I really miss this splitting of screens",
"['Mar 28, 2017']",Agreed that we need to be able to split both Horizonally AND Vertically.

"['Mar 29, 2017']",This is one of the only features that I would miss if I left Sublime or Atom and is keeping me from using VSCodeFor serious Coders or Authors who multi-task this is a required feature which should at least be supported in a plugin.,
"['Apr 10, 2017']","I've always felt that 3 windows is far too skinny/short to see anything clearly, and grid layouts are a great way to mitigate the problem.
