A vertical split, horizontal split at the same time.Clicking a button (or use the shortcut) to change the orientation, it becomes a little boring.Just as we drag the tab to the side it adjusts the window, dragging down, near the lower edge of this window to adjust, without the need to use ""Toggle Editor Group Layout"".",
"Nov 10, 2016",I used the   but wanted to provide verbal support for this usecase as well. I have a rather large monitor on which I use Sublime in a 2x3 grid which currently is not possible in VS Code as you have to choose between horizontal vs vertical.,
"Nov 20, 2016","After finally implementing #1749, this is another needed step towards making the workbench as flexible as in other editors (Sublime Text, Atom, vim, Emacs, full Visual Studio - they all support grid layouts). Especially on larger screens, it is very useful to use 2×2 or 1+2 grid layouts.

"Jan 9, 2017","@whitecolor VSCode has horizontal split.

Subscribe to issue 14909 to receive a notification when this happens."" Cool idea in theory! Minimal work on your end, leverages existing tools, users already know how to use Github, etc. But in practice, I'm getting a lot of noise from this issue, and I imagine other people are too. I subscribed within the last 24 hours and already received a dozen or so notifications through Github unrelated to the release that made me want to subscribe in the first place. I hope this constructive criticism is helpful! But I am definitely going to unsubscribe from this issue, and I do hope that another way of subscribing to new features can be worked out.

"Jun 7, 2018",@eighteyes I am counting ~35 new commands being added as part of grid that all can have keybindings assigned so please let me know which one is missing and we can look into adding it...,
"Jun 7, 2018","This is awesome! It's simply fantastic that the VSC team has been able to work on this and make it a reality. Can't wait for the stable release. As time goes on, I'm sure the team will bake in the ability to split in terminals, git windows, etc. For now, I cannot complain that this is coming and am simply ecstatic. Thanks for this! ",
"Jun 8, 2018","Dear VS Code team: you put in the VS Code release notes that we should subscribe to this issue on Github if we want to be notified when the feature is ready: ""This feature will be available in our Insiders release in the beginning of June. Subscribe to issue 14909 to receive a notification when this happens."" Cool idea in theory! Minimal work on your end, leverages existing tools, users already know how to use Github, etc. But in practice, I'm getting a lot of noise from this issue, and I imagine other people are too. I subscribed within the last 24 hours and already received a dozen or so notifications through Github unrelated to the release that made me want to subscribe in the first place. I hope this constructive criticism is helpful! But I am definitely going to unsubscribe from this issue, and I do hope that another way of subscribing to new features can be worked out. Sincerely yours: some random guy.",

"Jun 8, 2018",Awesome @pelotom thanks for the link!!,
"Jun 9, 2018","Closing this as the feature has landed in insiders (download). You can see this query for work that is still planned for this milestone (as for example to support ""Centered Editor Layout"" properly).Feel free to continue to report issues or feedback (after checking for duplicates).I will mark this issue as readonly to reduce the number of notifications people get.","['https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/', 'https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues']"
