"Oct 5, 2017",and its gone again. just restarted VSC like 8 times. my guess is it sends a request to the typings repository. and probably because of the load gets no/error response. shows a wrong error though.,
"Oct 5, 2017",I temporarily solved it by running sudo npm install -g types-registry,
"Oct 5, 2017","I just ran into this issue.  I also had an issue running:npm install -g --ignore-scripts types-registryI created the .staging directory manually, then the npm install was successful and the message went away:mkdir -p ~/.nvm/versions/node/v8.6.0/lib/node_modules/.stagingVersion 1.17.0-insiderf6ef4be",
"Oct 5, 2017","Could not install typings files for JavaScript language features. Please ensure that NPM is installed or configure 'typescript.npm' in your user settingsI've just got this warning on my VSCode (1.16.1 updated few weeks ago) after updating npm from 5.4.2 to 5.5.1 with npm update -g.

When I comment out the public one and use the internal one I get the error. This used to work without issues forever, so not sure what happened all of a sudden to cause it. It seems types-registry package was updated 48 minutes ago. So it may be a case where the mirror is lagging behind in getting it / syncing with the public npm. I will keep an eye on this and see if it goes away out of the blue, which may indicate this is the issue. Just posting so others may be aware that this could be the cause if they're using a private mirror or some similar setup.[EDIT] Update. The error went away after a little while as our mirror picked up the new types-registry",
"Oct 17, 2017",Any idea why this issue is closed?  I get the same error on a fresh install of VSC.  I'm using nvm via linux subsystem (Ubuntu) on Win 10,
