"['Mar 2, 2017']",@joaomoreno told me that he will put it on the dev tasks for march. So you just have to wait for few days/weeks now.There is also a slow workaround by manually installing extensions to vscode.http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37071388/how-to-install-vscode-extensions-offlineThis isn't comfortable but it helps if you are really in need of an important plugin.,
"['Mar 3, 2017']",You can also try and get off your proxy if you can. Installing extensions still work without the proxy.,
