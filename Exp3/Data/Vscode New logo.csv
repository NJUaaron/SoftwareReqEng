"Oct 6, 2017",VSCode Version:1.17.0OS Version:windows 10 X64 15063.632Steps to Reproduce:new logo put into the start menu is ugly！,
"Oct 6, 2017",The background is opaque！,
"Oct 6, 2017",It's very ugly!!!,
"Oct 6, 2017","The old one was perfect. The good thing is, that if you have it pinned on the macOS Dock and you update it, the icon does not change immediately to the ugly new one.",
"Oct 6, 2017",The old icon look better.,
"Oct 6, 2017",yeah!! ugly Logo and Shitty colour....,
"Oct 6, 2017","The old logo was better, no idea why anyone wanted to change it. Seems like change just for the sake of change.",
"Oct 6, 2017",I hate the new logo. The old one was glorious!,
"Oct 6, 2017",I'll get used to it! Thanks for all the updates VS Code team/contributors,
"Oct 6, 2017","Yeah, the new logo is horrific. Please, can it be reverted to the old logo by the next release?",
"Oct 6, 2017",Looks like an Office application ,
"Oct 6, 2017",Could always fork the project to get rid of it though? I kinda doubt Microsoft will listen to anyone here...,
"Oct 6, 2017",The colour change is fine but really preferred the old logo ,
"Oct 6, 2017","@billinghamj Yeah，background of icon colour is too deep,choose other colour will be perfect！Or，become transparent and look better！",
"Oct 6, 2017",@0xdeafcafe I don't think so!,
"Oct 6, 2017",Bring back the old blue icon!,
"Oct 6, 2017",See #6607 for more information about the new icon...,"['https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6607', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6607']"
"Oct 6, 2017",Please bring back the old logo,
"Oct 6, 2017","I want back blue logo, or green is also good, but this ""poop color logo"" is horrible and so ugly.And on desktop it isn't updated. (only if uninstall and install it's updated, but if I update old version, it's not)",
"Oct 6, 2017",Definitely not the best change of this version.And the colours? Orange for a stable and green for the insider?Is it just me or it's more natural to associate green with safer and yellow/orange/red with risks?,
"Oct 6, 2017",The files' icons are still blue:,
"Oct 6, 2017","I want back the blue one.btw, the color green means something bad in chinese, and I think it's not a good choice.",
"Oct 6, 2017",cmz and insiders is the same??,
"Oct 6, 2017",the old one was great.  why change it?,
"Oct 21, 2017",@orenmizr Done!,
"Oct 21, 2017",@orenmizr or use papyrus icon theme,

"Oct 23, 2017","Please, Mr. Microsoft, please return our logo. The orange does not have enough contrast and is confused with the color of my windows. And the lateral line shrinks the logo, discard it. And why in mac do not have the same logo? just add gradients.",
"Oct 23, 2017",Very ugly on Mac and Windows :-(  I surprised me that someone allowed this.,
"Oct 23, 2017",I'm gonna go back to using Sublime. Ping me once the old logo is back!,

"Oct 24, 2017","Thanks everyone for all the feedback, and again we apologize for not responding sooner.In a nutshell, we've decided to change the Stable orange to blue, and keep green for Insiders. You can read all about it in the blog post: https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theiconResolving this issue against a single issue tracking all the icon issues: #35683","['https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/35683', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/35683']"
"Oct 24, 2017",WE DID IT!!! reinstalls,
"Oct 24, 2017",proud of Microsoft for listening to the community these days. Tell the design team we still love them,
"Oct 24, 2017",,
"Oct 28, 2017",Ok great. but it's still orange... even after I downloaded it again.,
"Oct 28, 2017","@MrSunshyne it will be blue in the next stable release, available in early november.",
"Oct 29, 2017",so good to know MS rolls back! thank!,
"Oct 31, 2017",so ugly! nice to know we gonna go back to the BLUE color. I feel sick with this orange,
"Nov 9, 2017","Blue is Back!Thanks to everyone for giving the feedback and responding to it.I think we all learned a valuable design lesson here, which is: if you can replace Trump's hair with your logo and no one notices, it's time to rethink it.",
"Nov 14, 2017",Give me back my orange!,
"Nov 18, 2017",LOL. I was getting used to orange too :),
"Nov 18, 2017","Oh boy, one color changes everything :)",
"Nov 24, 2017",@ @sjetha-pason come on may be enough trolling this issue?,
"Nov 27, 2017",I think they weren't closing this issue so that they can relieve their work stress reading the comments made here? ,
"Nov 29, 2017","Rather indecisive, some people liked the orange and got used to it but on the other hand M$ actually did change it.. hmm...",
"Nov 29, 2017","In my experience, colors are culturally aligned in many things, but especially in UIs.  In the some cultures, brighter colors in UIs are considered gaudy, and in the other cultures they are preferred.  Reds and oranges, in particular, are discouraged in UIs in some cultures, because they invoke a warning response, while in other cultures, reds and orange are more popular.  So, I don't think it's surprising to hear some people express that they preferred orange.  That's part of the difficulty of building international UXs.",
"Nov 30, 2017",+1 for the blue logo,
"Dec 2, 2017","Not that I liked the orange logo, but it did work better in Windows' ""open with"" dialog:",
