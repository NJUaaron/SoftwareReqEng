It's weird though because the terminal will work fine for a bit and I can run node commands, ionic commands, etc. I'll minimize code or drag to a new window and terminal disappears.

"Feb 3, 2019","Wonder if this is related to to the issue.  I recently started experiencing an empty terminal on win 10, while pressing enter reveals the prompt.  I've noticed that there is a vertical scroll bar.  If I make the terminal window large/tall enough(half my screen) then a new terminal shows the prompts as expected without a scroll bar.  Not a show stopper, wondering if the experience is similar/repeatable for anyone here.",
