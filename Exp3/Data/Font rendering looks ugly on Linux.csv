"['Oct 6, 2017']",@Tyriar There might be a font that is missing? (This is Linux.),
"['Oct 6, 2017']","@chrmarti as for editor, I set exists fonts for editor (Droid Sans Mono Slashed, DejaVu Sans Mono and Droid Sans)",
"['Oct 6, 2017']",@cryptomaniac512 does it look right when you remove your custom font setting?,
"['Oct 6, 2017']","@Tyriar, no.",
"['Oct 6, 2017']",@cryptomaniac512 is this a recent regression or are you using VS Code for the first time?,
"['Oct 6, 2017']","@bpasero, I used the editor about 2 months ago and everything was fine.",
"['Oct 6, 2017']",But font has always been small in spite of GTK settings :(,
"['Oct 6, 2017']",@cryptomaniac512 any difference with our previous release (1.16) to see if this is a regression in 1.17 alone?,
"['Oct 6, 2017']",Same problem,
"['Oct 6, 2017']",@cryptomaniac512 I should have posted the link for 1.15 because in 1.16 we updated our UI framework (Electron) and that might have an impact too. How does it look in VSCode 1.15?,
"['Oct 6, 2017']",:(,
"['Oct 6, 2017']",Maybe try with 1.15.0 and 1.14?,
"['Oct 6, 2017']","This problem reproduced with 1.14.2.It looks like a problem with another software, but I have no problem anywhere instead of vscode.And I'm sure that everything was fine a couple of months ago",
"['Oct 6, 2017']",Fonts look good when I set sub-pixel geometry to none instead of RGBThis screenshot is for the 1.14.2,

"['Oct 6, 2017']",Probably problem with Freetype.I got the same problem when I upgrade to Freetype 2.8.1. Everything work fine with an older version of Freetype.Someone on Phoronix forum said something about bugs with older version of Google Skia.https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/software/desktop-linux/979076-freetype-improvements-for-the-adobe-engine?p=979131#post979131,
"['Oct 15, 2017']","I have the same problem here, please advise if you find a solution / workaround.This font rendering issue occurs  similarly with Atom in my case, no other applications are affected.Tested with Chromium Version 62.0.3202.18 (Developer Build) (64-bit) but also other versions, same result.I've tried also tweaking the antialias settings for my NVidia card and plasma5 environment, no success.It's really unuseable at the moment.",
"['Oct 17, 2017']",I can confirm that this is a FreeType related problem. Downgrading the libfreetype6 package on my Debian Sid box from 2.8.1-0.1 to 2.8-0.2 resolved this issue for me (I have also not had any problems with other applications).,
"['Oct 17, 2017']","Yes, I`m amazed, I've also downgraded to 2.8.0 on my gentoo desktop and the issue is gone.Thanks a lot for your reply.",
"['Oct 18, 2017']",This seems to be Skia bug 6663:https://bugs.chromium.org/p/skia/issues/detail?id=6663,
"['Mar 26, 2018']",@paladdins maybe change it to:sudo dpkg -i libfreetype6_2.8-0.2_amd64.debsudo apt-mark hold libfreetype6 otherwise apt upgrade would reinstall the latest one. And the latest updates did not fix the issue.People just need to remember to track that issue. Apt will show that a package is being held and not updated.,
"['Mar 27, 2018']",Thanks a lot. The solution fixed my problem also. But I wonder how to release the hold after executing it.sudo apt-mark hold libfreetype6,
"['Mar 27, 2018']",But I wonder how to release the hold after executing it.$ sudo apt-mark unhold libfreetype6$ man apt-mark,
"['Mar 27, 2018']",on Ubuntu I think I fixed withsudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extrasplease confirm someone.. (without downgrading libfreetype),
"['Mar 27, 2018']",Could be. It contains M$ proprietary ttf fonts. Might be that those are chosen then and cause less issues?,
"['Mar 28, 2018']",@peterducai I tried your package on a new install and it did not fix the issue. Downgrading freetype worked instantly.,
"['Mar 29, 2018']",I can confirm the issue on a fresh install of Ubuntu 18.04 beta with latest vscode. And downgrading libfreetype6 to 2.8-0.2 did fix it for me as well.,
"['Mar 29, 2018']","Latest ""insiders"" build works fine with fresh version of freetype.",
"['Mar 29, 2018']",@dmitryvk yeah It has been known that newer electron versions did not have this issue.So I guess they updated it finally. So we might expect this to be fixed by the next release.Maybe this can be closed with the next monthly then :)Again tl;drfix:Download http://snapshot.debian.org/package/freetype/2.8-0.2/#libfreetype6_2.8-0.2Install using sudo dpkg -i libfreetype6_2.8-0.2_amd64.debHold it (protect against upgrade/uninstall) with sudo apt-mark hold libfreetype6????Profit!Thanks to @paladdins et al.,
"['Mar 30, 2018']",Marking as verified as per updates above,
"['Mar 31, 2018']",I am on an Ubuntu 18.04 pre release and had artifacts in rendered fonts as described. Following the last few comments I installed code-insiders. The artifacts are no longer there. My libfreetype6 version is 2.8.1-2ubuntu1. Thank you.,
"['Mar 31, 2018']","I’m on Debian Stretch  (stable), just tried code-insider-1.22.0-1522420669, still looks bad, but have not changed libfreetype6… but I also do not have other apps with bad font rendering.I will simply continue using vscode stable with a simple patch: -webkit-text-stroke:0.25px; …If interested, you might want anywhere from 0.1px to 0.5px, perhaps 0.33px or 0.4px.

"['Apr 6, 2018']",When will vs code support the libfreetyp6 version 2.8.1 - does anybody know?downgrading / apt-mark hold for a package is just a workaround for the time being but not a final solution,
"['Apr 6, 2018']","Oh, I just installed v1.22.1, font rendering is so beautiful now! The code editor fonts were OK before using custom fonts like Anonymous Pro, but the UI &amp; integrated terminal fonts look way better now.

"['Apr 6, 2018']",I did not have this issue until I upgraded Ubuntu 17.10 to Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver (development branch),
