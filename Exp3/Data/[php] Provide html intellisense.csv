I've tried full Visual Studio + VS.php - also not supported. I keep wondering why is this overlooked in every Microsoft development tool that supposedly supports PHP. Yes, PHP support is there, but is useless if we don't have IntelliSense (code completition &amp; code suggestions) for HTML/CSS/JS as well.Same goes for JS blocks &amp; inline CSS in HTML.<br/>If I define in settings.json:<br/>""files.associations"": {""*.php"": ""html""},<br/>... than PHP IntelliSense (obviously) does not work, and HTML kicks in. But inline-CSS by using style="" ...something... ""; does not offer any CSS properties when writing in between quotes of style attribute.<br/>Likewise, if I start a &lt;script&gt; block, you won't get IntelliSense for JS, while opening .js file reacts normally.I do support suggestion that (if it's easier):&lt;?php ... ?&gt; should start the PHP IntelliSenseoutside &lt;?php ... ?&gt; should start HTML IntelliSense<br/>but alsoinside &lt;style&gt; ... &lt;/style&gt; and style="" .... "" should start CSS IntelliSenseinside &lt;script ... &gt; and &lt;script&gt; ... &lt;/script&gt; should start JS IntelliSenseAlso, if possible, a suggestion by @TheColorRed should be considered, meaning if you are inside<br/>&lt;?php ... ?&gt; but are writing a string eg $string=""..."" than it should consider turning HTML IntelliSense as well. Thing is, PHP devs often use something like:<br/>&lt;?php<br/>$something=""test"";<br/>echo ""&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=""http://sample.com""&gt;This is a "".$something.""&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"";<br/>$continue = ""coding here ... etc"";<br/>?&gt;<br/>..  to avoid doing blocks with opening/closing php tags all the time, like:<br/>&lt;?php<br/>$something=""test""; ?&gt;<br/>&lt;div&gt;<br/>&lt;a href=""http://sample.com""&gt;This is a &lt;?php echo $something; ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br/>&lt;/div&gt;<br/>&lt;?php<br/>$continue = ""coding here ... etc"";<br/>?&gt;Also @egamma , while we don't mean to sound ungrateful or lazy, smug comments don't do much help either, if one of us was competent and knowledgeable enough to code it ourselves - I'm sure we'd do it. Unfortunately - I am not :-/ But if I can help in any other way I'd be glad to (not just by commenting with suggestions, but testing, or whatever).I hope that there IS a consensus that this feature should exist, and that current PHP support without it is only a partial support for the most PHP devs.P.S. And again, not to sound as a critic - I really like VS Code so far, and am most thankful to everyone that contributed and keep contributing to this wonderful project!EDIT:<br/>Would simply including/referencing one .ts file to another work?<br/>E.g. in /languages/php/common/php.ts<br/>include: /languages/html/common/html.ts<br/>include: /languages/css/common/css.ts<br/>include: ...While there could be some overlap with the tag/attribute/function names nothing comes to my mind at the moment...

I understand that visual studio code can't and shouldn't provide all the features out of the box, but HTML support for PHP language should be one of the most basic feature for a PHP editor. Maybe most of the features for PHP should be provided by extensions, but this one shouldn't. Lots of editors have this feature, even the simple text editor, Notepad++, have this feature. This is part of the basic PHP grammar, and you can't write PHP without it. An editor shouldn't say that it supports PHP without this feature, for it can't read PHP in the right way.And why does Javascript in HTML file works well and CSS in HTML works well without any extension in vscode? It seems that vscode have this feature but don't want to make a similar one for PHP, That's unfair.This feature is really important for PHP users, and most user won't try to search these issues and they know nothing about the extensions which can help them get these basic and necessary features. These users may simply download this editor, install it and find this ""bug"", then uninstall it immediately and get a very bad impression about vscode. They won't say anything here. All the users who want to share their opinions here are the people who really want vscode to be better. The feeling for writing PHP code without this funtion is really too painful, you can't tell the blocks apart, you have to count the html tags manually, or convert the file format from php to html, and from html to php many times. All the other languages I have ever tried on the vscode won't have such bad feelings without any extension installed. Users won't know the reason, they just care about the user experience. Please consider about this and do something, even adding a little bit highlight is good too:provide some basic support for HTML, orprovide an official extension with this feature and install automatically when using PHPor even a simple recommedation for all the PHP user and install the recommended extension with one click, then get this feature and make vscode be able to really support PHP",
"<relative-time class=""no-wrap"" datetime=""2018-09-13T19:45:26Z"">Sep 13, 2018</relative-time>","Agreed, @popcorner is correct this is essential for PHP devs and considering WordPress powers ~30% of the internet or more and pretty much every theme or plugin has PHP nested with HTML in every template file. So basically a ridiculous amount of users right there in need of this.Now I actually think the core of this whole issue lies with the fact you can not register multiple formatting extensions at the same time. There is basically kind of a race on that hook and only one can win, plus you can't see as a user what is trying to run when, and which one actually ran. So for a PHP file, odiously your going to go with a formatting extension that does PHP code over HTML. But if you could chain formatting extensions and there was a hook order or something that was changeable then you could register a PHP and an HTML and then set the priority / order for one to run first / last.

"['Sep 13, 2018']","I just don't understand why you prioritize tasks over other, although the community definitely wants those. I only hear ""issue reduction"" and ""out of scope"", and, oh yeah, ""limited resources""(that's why the community is here, lol). Nobody complains about things not coming soon, but a little bit more focus on the needs of the community would definitely help. Why do we need to keep the issue number low, even though they don't pollute anything? In my eyes, the Code roadmap passed the sweet spot 2 iterations ago. Now, it is all about earning money(with the big community earned throughout the years; I'm using it since the first demo of Build(); everyday) by integrating paid and third-party products(like GitHub, owned by Microsoft).I'm saying that I'm not feeling welcome in this community anymore(and I'm honestly disappointed), I don't attack you personal in any way, so there is no reason to reference the COC here. It is part of FOSS-software to have open discussions.But speaking of COC, I'd quote this:Understand disagreementsI don't get why you want to shut me down, only because I disagree with the politics you do.I'm trying to understand why you changed your politics, so could you please elaborate?",
"['Sep 13, 2018']","@egamma I don't think that your reason for closing this issue is reasonable. I understand that visual studio code can't and shouldn't provide all the features out of the box, but HTML support for PHP language should be one of the most basic feature for a PHP editor. Maybe most of the features for PHP should be provided by extensions, but this one shouldn't. Lots of editors have this feature, even the simple text editor, Notepad++, have this feature. This is part of the basic PHP grammar, and you can't write PHP without it. An editor shouldn't say that it supports PHP without this feature, for it can't read PHP in the right way.And why does Javascript in HTML file works well and CSS in HTML works well without any extension in vscode? It seems that vscode have this feature but don't want to make a similar one for PHP, That's unfair.This feature is really important for PHP users, and most user won't try to search these issues and they know nothing about the extensions which can help them get these basic and necessary features. These users may simply download this editor, install it and find this ""bug"", then uninstall it immediately and get a very bad impression about vscode. They won't say anything here. All the users who want to share their opinions here are the people who really want vscode to be better. The feeling for writing PHP code without this funtion is really too painful, you can't tell the blocks apart, you have to count the html tags manually, or convert the file format from php to html, and from html to php many times. All the other languages I have ever tried on the vscode won't have such bad feelings without any extension installed. Users won't know the reason, they just care about the user experience. Please consider about this and do something, even adding a little bit highlight is good too:provide some basic support for HTML, orprovide an official extension with this feature and install automatically when using PHPor even a simple recommedation for all the PHP user and install the recommended extension with one click, then get this feature and make vscode be able to really support PHP",
"['Sep 13, 2018']","Agreed, @popcorner is correct this is essential for PHP devs and considering WordPress powers ~30% of the internet or more and pretty much every theme or plugin has PHP nested with HTML in every template file. So basically a ridiculous amount of users right there in need of this.Now I actually think the core of this whole issue lies with the fact you can not register multiple formatting extensions at the same time. There is basically kind of a race on that hook and only one can win, plus you can't see as a user what is trying to run when, and which one actually ran. So for a PHP file, odiously your going to go with a formatting extension that does PHP code over HTML. But if you could chain formatting extensions and there was a hook order or something that was changeable then you could register a PHP and an HTML and then set the priority / order for one to run first / last. For example this whole issue is fixed if you can...Step One run PHPCBF or similar PHP formatting extension.Step Two run js-beautify html formatting which just skips over all the PHP anyways and does the HTML only, which is the exact same thing I do in my extension, Format HTML in PHP, to fix the problem. But I have to run it onBeforeSave instead of using the default formatting registration, but this shouldn't have to be the solution.So to sum it up, it's very needed, but instead of fixing / not fixing the issue, why not explore my idea above and then you end up having a way better experience with every language and formatting, for users and extension developers.",

"['Sep 13, 2018']","I just don't understand why you prioritize tasks over other, although the community definitely wants those. I only hear ""issue reduction"" and ""out of scope"", and, oh yeah, ""limited resources""(that's why the community is here, lol). Nobody complains about things not coming soon, but a little bit more focus on the needs of the community would definitely help. Why do we need to keep the issue number low, even though they don't pollute anything? In my eyes, the Code roadmap passed the sweet spot 2 iterations ago. Now, it is all about earning money(with the big community earned throughout the years; I'm using it since the first demo of Build(); everyday) by integrating paid and third-party products(like GitHub, owned by Microsoft).I'm saying that I'm not feeling welcome in this community anymore(and I'm honestly disappointed), I don't attack you personal in any way, so there is no reason to reference the COC here. It is part of FOSS-software to have open discussions.But speaking of COC, I'd quote this:Understand disagreementsI don't get why you want to shut me down, only because I disagree with the politics you do.I'm trying to understand why you changed your politics, so could you please elaborate?",
"['Sep 13, 2018']","@egamma I don't think that your reason for closing this issue is reasonable. I understand that visual studio code can't and shouldn't provide all the features out of the box, but HTML support for PHP language should be one of the most basic feature for a PHP editor. Maybe most of the features for PHP should be provided by extensions, but this one shouldn't. Lots of editors have this feature, even the simple text editor, Notepad++, have this feature. This is part of the basic PHP grammar, and you can't write PHP without it. An editor shouldn't say that it supports PHP without this feature, for it can't read PHP in the right way.And why does Javascript in HTML file works well and CSS in HTML works well without any extension in vscode? It seems that vscode have this feature but don't want to make a similar one for PHP, That's unfair.This feature is really important for PHP users, and most user won't try to search these issues and they know nothing about the extensions which can help them get these basic and necessary features. These users may simply download this editor, install it and find this ""bug"", then uninstall it immediately and get a very bad impression about vscode. They won't say anything here. All the users who want to share their opinions here are the people who really want vscode to be better. The feeling for writing PHP code without this funtion is really too painful, you can't tell the blocks apart, you have to count the html tags manually, or convert the file format from php to html, and from html to php many times. All the other languages I have ever tried on the vscode won't have such bad feelings without any extension installed. Users won't know the reason, they just care about the user experience. Please consider about this and do something, even adding a little bit highlight is good too:provide some basic support for HTML, orprovide an official extension with this feature and install automatically when using PHPor even a simple recommedation for all the PHP user and install the recommended extension with one click, then get this feature and make vscode be able to really support PHP",
"['Sep 13, 2018']","Agreed, @popcorner is correct this is essential for PHP devs and considering WordPress powers ~30% of the internet or more and pretty much every theme or plugin has PHP nested with HTML in every template file. So basically a ridiculous amount of users right there in need of this.Now I actually think the core of this whole issue lies with the fact you can not register multiple formatting extensions at the same time. There is basically kind of a race on that hook and only one can win, plus you can't see as a user what is trying to run when, and which one actually ran. So for a PHP file, odiously your going to go with a formatting extension that does PHP code over HTML. But if you could chain formatting extensions and there was a hook order or something that was changeable then you could register a PHP and an HTML and then set the priority / order for one to run first / last. For example this whole issue is fixed if you can...Step One run PHPCBF or similar PHP formatting extension.Step Two run js-beautify html formatting which just skips over all the PHP anyways and does the HTML only, which is the exact same thing I do in my extension, Format HTML in PHP, to fix the problem. But I have to run it onBeforeSave instead of using the default formatting registration, but this shouldn't have to be the solution.So to sum it up, it's very needed, but instead of fixing / not fixing the issue, why not explore my idea above and then you end up having a way better experience with every language and formatting, for users and extension developers.",
"['Nov 25, 2015']","In PHP files there is no html tags auto completion, please add.EDIT 9/13/2018 @egamma: VS Code provides only basic support for PHP, but there are powerful PHP extensions available in the market place:PHP IntelliSensePHP Intelephence.This feature should be provided by these extensions (Intelephence actually already does support it). Please give these extensions a try and help to make them better by filing issues and pull requests.This issue has lost focus and turned into a discussion whether VS Code should provide PHP support out of box. However, as with many other language like C#, C++, Go, Python, Rust we do not want to bundle PHP with VS Code but rather rely on our great extension ecosystem. IÂ´m therefore closing this issue.",

"['Apr 19, 2016']",Almost every PHP developer will need this feature in order to pick VSCode as their primary editor.We need this issue to be fixed in order to target more developers.Yesterday I tried bumping my head against this problem but unfortunately my lack of TypeScript skills are holding me back to help you on this issue.,
"['Apr 29, 2016']",I need this!,
"['Apr 29, 2016']",Same. Simply +1000,
"['May 5, 2016']","I'm unable to help, but another +1000 from me. HTML/CSS/JS in PHP is common as a mixed file. I've tried full Visual Studio + VS.php - also not supported. I keep wondering why is this overlooked in every Microsoft development tool that supposedly supports PHP. Yes, PHP support is there, but is useless if we don't have IntelliSense (code completition &amp; code suggestions) for HTML/CSS/JS as well.Same goes for JS blocks &amp; inline CSS in HTML.If I define in settings.json:""files.associations"": {""*.php"": ""html""},... than PHP IntelliSense (obviously) does not work, and HTML kicks in. But inline-CSS by using style="" ...something... ""; does not offer any CSS properties when writing in between quotes of style attribute.Likewise, if I start a &lt;script&gt; block, you won't get IntelliSense for JS, while opening .js file reacts normally.I do support suggestion that (if it's easier):&lt;?php ... ?&gt; should start the PHP IntelliSenseoutside &lt;?php ... ?&gt; should start HTML IntelliSensebut alsoinside &lt;style&gt; ... &lt;/style&gt; and style="" .... "" should start CSS IntelliSenseinside &lt;script ... &gt; and &lt;script&gt; ... &lt;/script&gt; should start JS IntelliSenseAlso, if possible, a suggestion by @TheColorRed should be considered, meaning if you are inside&lt;?php ... ?&gt; but are writing a string eg $string=""..."" than it should consider turning HTML IntelliSense as well. Thing is, PHP devs often use something like:&lt;?php$something=""test"";echo ""&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=""http://sample.com""&gt;This is a "".$something.""&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"";$continue = ""coding here ... etc"";?&gt;..  to avoid doing blocks with opening/closing php tags all the time, like:&lt;?php$something=""test""; ?&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=""http://sample.com""&gt;This is a &lt;?php echo $something; ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;?php$continue = ""coding here ... etc"";?&gt;Also @egamma , while we don't mean to sound ungrateful or lazy, smug comments don't do much help either, if one of us was competent and knowledgeable enough to code it ourselves - I'm sure we'd do it. Unfortunately - I am not :-/ But if I can help in any other way I'd be glad to (not just by commenting with suggestions, but testing, or whatever).I hope that there IS a consensus that this feature should exist, and that current PHP support without it is only a partial support for the most PHP devs.P.S. And again, not to sound as a critic - I really like VS Code so far, and am most thankful to everyone that contributed and keep contributing to this wonderful project!EDIT:Would simply including/referencing one .ts file to another work?E.g. in /languages/php/common/php.tsinclude: /languages/html/common/html.tsinclude: /languages/css/common/css.tsinclude: ...While there could be some overlap with the tag/attribute/function names nothing comes to my mind at the moment...

"['Sep 13, 2018']","@jens1o IÂ´m confused, this decision is all about fostering the OSS ecosystem. The referenced extensions are OSS projects, please help to make them better. The resources of the VS Code team are not unlimited.Also, please do not forget our Code of Conduct and letÂ´s communicate in a respectful way.",
"['Sep 13, 2018']","I just don't understand why you prioritize tasks over other, although the community definitely wants those. I only hear ""issue reduction"" and ""out of scope"", and, oh yeah, ""limited resources""(that's why the community is here, lol). Nobody complains about things not coming soon, but a little bit more focus on the needs of the community would definitely help. Why do we need to keep the issue number low, even though they don't pollute anything? In my eyes, the Code roadmap passed the sweet spot 2 iterations ago. Now, it is all about earning money(with the big community earned throughout the years; I'm using it since the first demo of Build(); everyday) by integrating paid and third-party products(like GitHub, owned by Microsoft).I'm saying that I'm not feeling welcome in this community anymore(and I'm honestly disappointed), I don't attack you personal in any way, so there is no reason to reference the COC here. It is part of FOSS-software to have open discussions.But speaking of COC, I'd quote this:Understand disagreementsI don't get why you want to shut me down, only because I disagree with the politics you do.I'm trying to understand why you changed your politics, so could you please elaborate?",
"['Sep 13, 2018']","@egamma I don't think that your reason for closing this issue is reasonable. I understand that visual studio code can't and shouldn't provide all the features out of the box, but HTML support for PHP language should be one of the most basic feature for a PHP editor. Maybe most of the features for PHP should be provided by extensions, but this one shouldn't. Lots of editors have this feature, even the simple text editor, Notepad++, have this feature. This is part of the basic PHP grammar, and you can't write PHP without it. An editor shouldn't say that it supports PHP without this feature, for it can't read PHP in the right way.And why does Javascript in HTML file works well and CSS in HTML works well without any extension in vscode? It seems that vscode have this feature but don't want to make a similar one for PHP, That's unfair.This feature is really important for PHP users, and most user won't try to search these issues and they know nothing about the extensions which can help them get these basic and necessary features. These users may simply download this editor, install it and find this ""bug"", then uninstall it immediately and get a very bad impression about vscode. They won't say anything here. All the users who want to share their opinions here are the people who really want vscode to be better. The feeling for writing PHP code without this funtion is really too painful, you can't tell the blocks apart, you have to count the html tags manually, or convert the file format from php to html, and from html to php many times. All the other languages I have ever tried on the vscode won't have such bad feelings without any extension installed. Users won't know the reason, they just care about the user experience. Please consider about this and do something, even adding a little bit highlight is good too:provide some basic support for HTML, orprovide an official extension with this feature and install automatically when using PHPor even a simple recommedation for all the PHP user and install the recommended extension with one click, then get this feature and make vscode be able to really support PHP",
"['Sep 13, 2018']","Agreed, @popcorner is correct this is essential for PHP devs and considering WordPress powers ~30% of the internet or more and pretty much every theme or plugin has PHP nested with HTML in every template file. So basically a ridiculous amount of users right there in need of this.Now I actually think the core of this whole issue lies with the fact you can not register multiple formatting extensions at the same time. There is basically kind of a race on that hook and only one can win, plus you can't see as a user what is trying to run when, and which one actually ran. So for a PHP file, odiously your going to go with a formatting extension that does PHP code over HTML. But if you could chain formatting extensions and there was a hook order or something that was changeable then you could register a PHP and an HTML and then set the priority / order for one to run first / last. For example this whole issue is fixed if you can...Step One run PHPCBF or similar PHP formatting extension.Step Two run js-beautify html formatting which just skips over all the PHP anyways and does the HTML only, which is the exact same thing I do in my extension, Format HTML in PHP, to fix the problem. But I have to run it onBeforeSave instead of using the default formatting registration, but this shouldn't have to be the solution.So to sum it up, it's very needed, but instead of fixing / not fixing the issue, why not explore my idea above and then you end up having a way better experience with every language and formatting, for users and extension developers.",
