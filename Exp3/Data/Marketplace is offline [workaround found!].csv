"['Sep 4, 2018']","The server died from the looks of it, It will probably be fixed within a few hours or a day or so. MS will probably fix it quickly.",
"['Sep 4, 2018']",I also just noticed it. Good luck with fixing it Microsoft!I'm confident it'll be fixed in a matter of hours ,
"['Sep 4, 2018']","@RevoluPowered It's clearly a broken robot, it's wires are hanging out.",
"['Sep 4, 2018']","@dapen85 Obviously, the front fell off.",
"['Sep 4, 2018']","Damn, have neem toying with the idea of getting into QSharp, went to download it and there's a broken robot. The Multiverse is trying to tell me that Im not in a suitable superposition",
"['Sep 4, 2018']","I reported it to VSTS on twitter too, so it should eventually be fixed lol, I don't think they're checking github atm.",
"['Sep 4, 2018']","""Apologies for the inconveniences, Gordon.Our team is already working on this issue. Stay tuned for the latest updates here: http://msft.social/wApOP9 .Regards.""",[]
"['Sep 4, 2018']","They should at least implement something in VSCode saying the server is down or something, because right now, you just see that there is no results for your search terms.",
"['Sep 4, 2018']",They definitely do need to.It's pretty serious whats going on:(will definitely have broken other stuff too - on azure; so check your infrastructure if you use them for hosting)Users located in South Central US will be unable to access their account until the underlying issue is resolved. Other regions may experience high failure rates and load times due to dependencies in South Central US. We are working to mitigate the impact for users outside of South Central US to the best of our abilities.,
"['Sep 4, 2018']","Same here in South Africa.  And this on the day that I need to preview some markdown in the browser!OS X 10.13.6 and VSCode Version 1.26.1, Johannesburg, ZA for reference.",

"['Sep 4, 2018']",Any new from Microsoft regarding this?,
"['Sep 4, 2018']","It's effecting everyone. No updates.Office365, Azure, VSCode, VS Team Services, Windows Update will probably be effected too.Reports in my office of their other platforms slowing down (Azure, Office365) because of the cooling failure in one data center. By slowing down 10 second refresh times on the Office365 portal.Checked with my sysadmin and he is experiencing issues with it too.",
"['Sep 4, 2018']",Inspecting marketplace API responses for visual studio code looks bad:,
"['Sep 4, 2018']","Do you think they're potentially causing VSCode to point at another domainif so, should we even have it open until this is fixed..?",
"['Sep 4, 2018']","@mglgmz FYI the ""malicious"" key in the response appears to be a long-standing feature for blacklisting scams, etc: #42115 #41608","['https://github.com/mglgmz', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/42115', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/42115', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/41608', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/41608']"

"['Sep 4, 2018']","Just installed Visual Code for the first time and this happened .Since this issue has been going on for more than 5 hours, I am guessing it's a big one. I will just wait till tomorrow and keep an eye on this thread.",
"['Sep 4, 2018']","Probably related to Azure problems:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/status/Starting at 09:29 UTC on 04 Sep 2018, customers in South Central US may experience difficulties connecting to resources hosted in this region. Engineers have isolated an issue with cooling in one part of the data center, which caused a localized spike in temperature, as the preliminary root-cause, which has now been mitigated. Automated data center procedures to ensure data and hardware integrity went into effect when temperatures hit a specified threshold and critical hardware entered a structured power down process.  Engineers are now in the process of restoring power to affected devices as part of the ongoing mitigation process.Some services may also be experiencing intermittent authentication issues due to downstream Azure Active Directory impact, and engineers are separately working on mitigation options for this also.",
