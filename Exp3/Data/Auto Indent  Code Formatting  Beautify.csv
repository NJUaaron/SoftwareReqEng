"Mar 11, 2016",This is an ongoing feedback issue from User Voice.,
"Mar 11, 2016","From User Voice - Maintain indentation level on copy and paste""When you cut a block of code and paste it somewhere with a different indentation level (i.e. inside nested ifs) it'd be nice to get it properly indented, automatically on paste.""",
"Mar 11, 2016","From User Voice - Auto indenting line based on language's standard""In PyCharm, when you type "":"" and press Enter then the next line is automatically indented to the appropriate level according to the chosen language's standard.""",
"Mar 11, 2016","From User Voice - Tab size per language""One specific thing that I've came across though: I've set my tab size to 2 in my user settings file. That tab size is honored when I format a .ts or .js file. It is NOT honored when I auto format a .cs file - then it seems to go on a 4 space indent. Is this a separate setting?""",
"Mar 11, 2016","From User Voice - CSS / Less indenting""The only thing that's missing for me is the out of the box LESS indent functionality (all other file types I work with work just fine). I had to install a plugin that auto formats CSS but it's not exactly the same. It's also missing some features like preserving spaces/line breaks and so on... something that should be configurable if you're adding this support. """,
"Mar 11, 2016","From User Voice - Format issues with C#""This needs to be added. I want to write my C# code with the K&amp;R style, but every time I try to format it it screws everything up.""",
"Mar 11, 2016","From User Voice - HTML / CSHTML editing capabilities""Just look at VS2015's capabilities during editing of an HTML or CSHTML file - replicate that.""",
"Mar 11, 2016","From User Voice - Auto formatting""It should pick up the type of language based on the choice you made at the bottom right of the screen. If I open a .log file for instance that has xml in it, I would like it to autoformat to the xml setting I changed it too. using the editor.action.format ONLY works based on the file name not what I have told it the contents are. Definitely should appear on the context menu""",
"Mar 11, 2016","Currently there's no auto-indentation for CoffeeScript (e.g. function, condition, and loop bodies), and in some situations tab key produces 4 spaces in a 2 space file (default indentation settings).",
"Mar 11, 2016",Autoformat like netbeans does...,
"Mar 11, 2016",@geomorillo can you be more specific? What exactly does Netbeans do that is missing?,
"Mar 12, 2016","Powershell (I suspect this may be the same for other languages):Heredoc text is not folded as the end tag must have no white space before it. Often heredoc text has no leading whitespace on any line.Here is the code I used for testing:function FunctionName  {    $a = @""This is some sample text to demonstrate a code folding issuewithing VS Code. ""@}",
"Mar 14, 2016","Sublime Text 3 has the feature to paste text with automatic indentation (Ctrl+Shift+V), which basically adds or removes levels and adjusts the first line to match the current block indentation.UPD:This behavior can be default for Ctrl+V (like in IntelliJ IDEA, afaik), and have Ctrl+Shift+V for HTML previews as it is right now.UPD 2:There is an extension that adds an extension.pasteAndFormat command, which can be used in keybindings.json (combination of editor.action.clipboardPasteAction and editor.action.format).I thought why not allowing users to define keybindings with multiple commands using the array syntax, like this?  ...  {    ""key"": ""ctrl+shift+v"",    ""command"": [      ""editor.action.clipboardPasteAction"",      ""editor.action.format""    ]  }  ...This would solve the problem and add a possibility to create mini-macros, sort of!

"Mar 14, 2016","Ooo, pasting with correct indentation should be the default.",
"Mar 15, 2016","Formatting CSS doesn't seem to properly work anymore.You use to be able to paste in a block of css in one line, hit the shift + alt +f and it would correctly format the code.  This no longer works.For example:body{background-color:#FFF;}#test{position:absolute;}Would turn into:body{    background-color:#FFF;}#test{    position:absolute;}",

"Mar 22, 2016",@cs04riva: Sorry for misleading. I was just adding another feature I'd love.,
"Mar 23, 2016","The current one is quite good. The indenting leaves some tabs/spaces in the left sometimes. Specially in cases of HTML. Cases like a blank line/row is also left as is and is not removed. You can have visual studio code settings for this whether to remove blank lines/rows May be this is on purpose I guess. More, what is missing is in-file/active-file code minification/uglifying/removing blankspaces etc for all supported languages. A nice valueadd to have when having indenting/formating.",
"Apr 1, 2016",I would really love to see an option to format on save,

Can we start with ""Refactor &gt; Change Signature"" and ""Extract Method from Selection""?

"Apr 18, 2016","@MaDDoXbr but it is a text editor, not an IDE.",
"Apr 18, 2016","I know, yet it could be a full-featured IDE if Microsoft wanted it to.",
"Apr 18, 2016","No point in arguing text editor vs IDE (VSCode's selling points include features of both). Thin and popular features go into the base product, heavy or niche features into extensions.Correct indentation on paste and formatting support for more languages are obvious candidates for base product.",
"Apr 21, 2016","The ""paste and format"" thing is only partly a solution for me. I would like to have the indention adjusted without any other modification of the pasted content - like it's in Sublime.The thing is, I sometimes accidentally introduce ""wrong coding style"" into a file in a repo which uses different coding style than what VSCode is configured to use. For example, I paste-and-format a piece of JS and VSCode changes the if(condition) to if (condition) with a space.Also I noticed that often the even indention is not correct, for example the first line is not enough indented. Again, I do compare this to Sublime Text 3 because I'm in the process of switching from it to VSCode because I like several aspects more, but there are still issues like this which are very annoying.",
"May 13, 2016","I agree with @CherryDT .I don't like the space between function and () (i.e. function (a, b) {...}) and would like to modify this behavier.Sorry, found the options:""javascript.format.insertSpaceAfterFunctionKeywordForAnonymousFunctions"" does the job.",
"May 23, 2016","Two things I want to report on.I've noticed that the package.json file, when formatted, does not respect the configuration settings in place. For example, I use tabs, not spaces. Formatting works, but does not take into account my settings. All other files in my project do.I've also noticed when placing inline SVGs into my HTML that the file will not format nicely, and toggling the outlines for the SVG element does not work as expected. Everything works as expected IF you have manually spaced/tabbed your SVG elements. This is hard for me to explain, I'd be happy to record my screen.",
"Dec 6, 2017","@halukkaramete I had the same problem for JavaScript files and got around it by changing the language mode to anything else (in this case, Batch file, because it was first on the list) before saving and then switching back after saving. I eventually got so annoyed by this that I disabled all extensions one by one and finally figured out that ""vscode-json"" was my culprit. I haven't had the issue since uninstalling it.",
"Jan 31, 2018",I'm also struggling with this autoformatting issue. Whenever I paste a piece of code in my SASS files the new extra line is added. It makes such a mess in my code. Is there a way to prevent such a behaviour?,

"May 23, 2018","@rrd108 how were you even able to format a smarty template? I've just tried to format .tpl file using Alt+Opt+F, but it keeps saying ""There is no document formatter for 'smarty'-files installed."". I'd be glad to apply ol'good-HTML formatting rules to this file (it doesn't have any smarty tags at this moment), but I don't see a way to do it…",

"Jun 10, 2018",I have spend at least 2.5 hours to fix this auto formatting on save issue and I had no success. This is really frustrating. the is no settings to stop this.,
"Jun 10, 2018",Step 1. open op atomStep 2: auto formatStep 3: open vscode back up;),
"Jun 10, 2018","But seriously, there should be some language-nonspecific way of converting say a 4-space indented file to a 2-space indented file.",
"Jun 10, 2018","@mityukov Have you tried changing the language mode for the file to HTML before formatting? i've had success formatting files after changing the language mode to any, didn't matter the file extension.",
"Jun 10, 2018","@sam0x17 There are plugins for such purpose, i'm not sure this is the best example but here's one: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Compulim.indent4to2Also using auto-formatters like prettier should do the trick assuming you configure it correctly, though prettier might not be language agnostic.",
"Jun 11, 2018","@luchillo17Have you tried changing the language mode for the file to HTML before formattingNope. I've had such idea, but I couldn't find how :/",
"Jun 11, 2018","Sight...Lower right corner, if that kind of file doesn't have a parser associated you'll see something like ""Plain Text"", if it does it will state the mode like ""Html"" or ""JavaScript"" or ""TypeScript""...Also anything you can do through interface can be done through the command palette, press Ctrl + Shift + P and type ""Language"", one of them should say ""Change Language Mode"".Then is up to you which one you want to select, you said you want Html right? just type html and select one of the options.",
"Jul 30, 2018","auto formatting jsx file is going crazy, How can I avoid this?",
"Jul 30, 2018","@sam0x17 There are plugins for such purpose, i'm not sure this is the best example but here's one: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Compulim.indent4to2My point is you shouldn't have to worry about finding a plugin for something basic like this. Atom does this out of the box without any plugins, and automatically can do it for any language that has a syntax highlighting plugin. Prettier/eslint/rubocop/whatever might not respect my user-configured tab/spaces preference (2 spaces always in my case) so you're taking something that should be a basic editor feature and leaving it up to the third party ecosystem which is going to do a terrible, inconsistent job with it because there are no editor-level conventions that let a language specify how the editor should do auto-indenting for that language.Right now my workflow is literally use vscode for most things, copy paste to and from atom whenever I need to mess with indents, because the vscode tools for that are that bad.",
"Aug 19, 2018","I have default settings with 2 spaces for indent. I want the the cursor to figure out where it should be when I hit enter, as I am typing it, like every other IDE (Intellij, Xcode, Android Studio, Eclipse, etc)Stuff like this works fine.if (x) {  good();}Problems arise when I hit ENTER at the end of a statement on a multiline that ends in a diff column than it started, or hitting ENTER mid statement to break a longer line. For example:I would like this to happen as I type and press ENTER (4 spaces, double my default indent)const stream = getSomeSource()    .map(...)    .filter(...);I would even settle for this (2 spaces, same as my default indent)const stream = getSomeSource()  .map(...)  .filter(...);But this is what I get before running the format command.const stream = getSomeSource().map(...).filter(...);I have spent hours with vscode settings and extensions but cannot get this simple behavior. The ""formatOnType"" option is close, but doesn't seem to work for ENTER key, and there are still no options for line-continuation, chained methods, etc.Ideally:A. The cursor always knows where it should be after hitting enter.B. EditorConfig-like continuation_indent_size so that the above can be fine-tuned.This is what the config looks like in Intellij:",
"Oct 4, 2018",exactly the same issue with @clocksmithspent too much time searching for a solution but none succeed,
"Oct 19, 2018",+1000 to what @clocksmith said.That's EXACTLY what I came here hoping to find.It's actually not possible?Someone save us.  I want to search for a plugin but seems like there have been many fruitless efforts and I've spent long enough configuring this to match the ease of use that WebStorm offered.,
"Oct 19, 2018","agree, what @clocksmith said, with the addition that ""auto format"" should be an editor-level option that works for any language plugin like it does in Atom.",
"Oct 30, 2018","Another thing I would like to point at is, when I am in a .php file, say it contains HTML. I can format the HTML by choosing the Language Mode to HTML. But it is better to have an option to directly format the php file without choosing to change the Language Mode option to HTML. It should be able to format the HTML in the php file.",
"Nov 9, 2018","Could you please add to Visual Studio Code some way to configure ""Format Document"" option.It would really help us with work. When we work in teams where everyone uses different editor, VSC cannot be configured as the team decided the code should look like. So I am forced not to use VSC because this is not configurable. This is deal breaker for me. Using VSC makes my Git commits have so many differences that this makes other team crazy.",
