If so, just open the parent folder, or parent / parent folder... wherever the root of your ""solution"" is.",
"Nov 22, 2015","Well, if you have a number of modules (which are all in their own git repository) that is independent of each other but you have one repository that uses those dependencies it makes sense to be able to open these independent folders and make changes that would be reflected so you can test it locally. That would still be a lightweight code editor but a more useful one imho!",

"Nov 22, 2015","@stoffeastrom sounds like a use case for submodules; I'm not sure how your project would reference another, unless you were aliasing with some mechanism, such as npm linking, etc. This problem is what package managers are largely intended to solve. If the modules are tightly coupled, then they really aren't isolated modules. You wouldn't be able to reliably make changes to support one project without worrying about the change having consequences for other consumers down the road. Even with submodules, they are read-only by default for exactly that reason.At any rate, what @Tyriar just mentioned is one of the reasons I am wary of having this type of multi-working path interface in a single instance/window: you have to handle integrations (like git), extensions, refactoring, debugging, etc, etc, etc. all in some isolated fashion. For instance:If I use the git integration to commit, am I committing project A or project B?If I refactor a class name in TypeScript, should it refactor in project A or project B, or both? What if the same class name exists in both projects with different meanings? What if one is loosely referencing the other?These are just some examples of how something seemingly simple can get very complicated, very quickly. I think it would be way more confusing and, frankly, less useful than to alt-tab/cmd+tab between a few separate instances of VSCode, each happily managing their own isolated working path without all the extra effort and edge case issues.Im not saying that it couldn't be solved, but I don't quite understand why switching between multiple windows and/or instances is an issue.
