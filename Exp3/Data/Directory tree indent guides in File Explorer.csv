"['Dec 23, 2016']",It's hard to navigate through project with complex directory structure.Much better to look at something like this:├─ app|  └─ main.js├─ src|  ├─ main.ts|  └─ tsconfig.json└─ package.jsonInstead of this:  app    main.js  src    main.ts    tsconfig.json  package.json,
"['Jan 24, 2017']",I agree with this. I especially find that the indenting is hard to interpret. And is even worse when file icons are enabled in explorer.,
"['Feb 5, 2017']",I also agree! +1,
"['Mar 23, 2017']","Another thing that would be nice in that regard is customizing the indent distance of the next level of hierarchy.While I would also love some guidelines, I think having i.e. twice the distance and thus having clearer separation would already help a lot.",
"['Apr 1, 2017']","@Aides359  I agree. Everyone's eyes are different. Just look at tabs. Some people like 2 space tabs in their code. Some like 8. Other 4.I'm a little dyslexic, so I really have a hard time with the indention in VS Code,Though it does seem to have gotten a little better. But it's still bad on my laptop screen, for instance, whereas on my large monitors at work, it's more noticeably indented.",
"['Apr 23, 2017']",Yes! Please tree lines as an option. It'd be especially helpful when editor is open at a far corner on a large monitor.Tying the toggle to mouse-over in Explorer Pane would help in keeping the clean look.,
"['Jun 22, 2017']",Really useful on big projects.Any update on this? Or where I could start looking in the source?,

"['Jun 24, 2017']",So yup... my eyes are bleeding. I'm like what is index.js of Expression folder... I know you're there!.I think it should have quite high priority. Modern web apps quite often have deep nested files structure. see this example,
"['Jul 7, 2017']",and here's the approximate look without Magnifier. not so bad... if you've got the vision of a fighter pilot,
"['Jul 11, 2017']","I would like this as well, it's quite easy to get lost in larger projects.",
"['Jul 11, 2017']","I also agree this should be considered, even when you start a tiny project and know every file by heart, it's kind of annoying to find them when you want to use the explorer, and not the ""Quick File Opener""...",
"['Jul 13, 2017']",I agree! I've been trying to look for a setting or extension that does this over the last two days but nothing T_T. I really struggle to navigate using the explorer (very helpful when you're navigating a new project).Indent lines would be amazing!,

"['Sep 21, 2017']","+1 for this.In the meantime, I've found a bit of a hack to solve it for now:Find your VSCode install (mine was C:/Program Files/Microsoft VS Code) and go to resources/app/out/vs/workbench and open workbench.main.css.Add these lines to the end of the file:.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""1""]  { padding-left:   0px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""2""]  { padding-left:  20px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""3""]  { padding-left:  40px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""4""]  { padding-left:  60px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""5""]  { padding-left:  80px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""6""]  { padding-left: 100px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""7""]  { padding-left: 120px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""8""]  { padding-left: 140px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""9""]  { padding-left: 160px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""10""] { padding-left: 180px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""11""] { padding-left: 200px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""12""] { padding-left: 220px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""13""] { padding-left: 240px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""14""] { padding-left: 260px !important; }.monaco-tree-row[aria-level=""15""] { padding-left: 280px !important; }Done!That code indents each level a further 20px, starting from 0px (the !important overrides the default values), but of course you can change that from 20px to as much as you want, just change the values. I've also only gone 15 levels deep, which you can expand too, but if your project is deeper than 15 levels, I'd suggest you re-evaluate your directory structure. ;)",
"['Sep 21, 2017']","@jakewtaylor this worked great for me, the only issue is that you will receive a 'corrupted installation' notification after doing the changes (..more info here).",
"['Sep 21, 2017']","@jakewtaylor @swordf1zh could you provide some screenshot with this 'hack'?Inspired with your idea, I've created styles like:.monaco-tree .monaco-tree-rows&gt;.monaco-tree-row {    position: relative;}.monaco-tree .monaco-tree-rows&gt;.monaco-tree-row:before {    content: '';    top: 0px;    bottom: 0px;    position: absolute;    border-left: 1px dotted rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);    border-bottom: 1px dotted rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);    width: 15px;    border-radius: 1px;}It's far from solid indent guide, but it's some step forward:",

"['Sep 22, 2017']",@pie6k Your hack would be a perfect temporary solution except that it hasn't worked quite as well for me for some reason T_T (see pic below)@jakewtaylor Can't wait ,
