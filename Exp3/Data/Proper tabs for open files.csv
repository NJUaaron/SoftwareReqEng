It is extensible to having one or more sections of tabs each with their own set of opened files. (Again i am taking Sublime Text as reference here),
"<relative-time class=""no-wrap"" datetime=""2015-12-21T13:33:52Z"">Dec 21, 2015</relative-time>","I think having tabs or not is independent from having sections. Today you can open up to 3 editors side by side in VS Code and thus we do have sections. Since we do not have tabs, we do not add multiple files into these sections and you can also not have empty sections (which is a separate UX discussion).Coming back to Ctrl+Tab: We in the team have always worked without tabs from day one and actually we did not even have the working files view for a long time and in fact not so many people in the team are using it. We found that for us it does not matter that much which file you had open or closed. Our minds are rather thinking about the chronological order of which file we edited last. So when I bring up Ctrl+Tab it will typically show me those files I was in last. I am not really looking at the number of files in there, I am only interested in the Top 5 ones at max. The advantage of this model is that you do not have to manage layouts and tabs at all. The management happens naturally while you navigate between files.We can add a file picker for working files, but it would be interesting to hear if people can be convinced to use Ctrl+Tab as it is today and learn what the issues are.",
"<relative-time class=""no-wrap"" datetime=""2015-12-21T13:42:54Z"">Dec 21, 2015</relative-time>","@bpasero I'll give ctrl+tab a shot, I just realized it can be used for going by to the previous file which is something I wanted and hadn't looked into yet until now. So that's nice.By the way, regardless of whether one can get by / used to ctrl+tab as an alternative to tabs, new VS code users will probably be put off by the lack of tabs, so if only for marketshare reasons I'd recommend having a tabs option. Every other editor uses tabs (for better or worse), and not having them introduces a rather unnecessary entry barrier to VS code. I'm using VS code regardless of tab support because of its awesome typescript support, but if it wasn't for that I don't know if I would have kept at it the first few times I tried it.",

Our intention is to improve the experience such that managing the list of open and recent files is straightforward and easy and allows the user to focus on their code, without having to pay any undue attention to the VS Code UI.Our hypothesis is that the current system has some rough edges (e.g., closing an editor actually closes the editor, but we think that perhaps it should instead show the file that was previously open in that same editor) and that smoothing out these rough edges will help create a far better experience.We do UX studies on the product on a very regular basis. In fact, that's how we design a lot of the UX in the product. We iterate over our designs based on real feedback making sure that we use a great understanding of what people do and want to do with the product to inform our designs.If you would like to participate in these studies in the future (we won't be running any again until mid January at the earliest) let me know and I will add your name to the list.","['https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1133', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1133']"

VS-proper has small discreet tabs, which are unintrusive (vscode already has the filename taking up space where the tab would otherwise be). I do agree that runaway tab spam is a problem, it might be nice to innovate and address this, but I'd say that's lower priority than having tabs at all. VSCode needs to reach a minimum working state. Right now, I find it's getting very close, but I can't quite work productively yet. Starting with established patterns would probably get us working sooner.It's worth keeping in mind that not everyone is a web developer, I find that patterns and workflow tends to be slightly different for different languages and styles of application. As a native developer, it is common to have a set of associated files visible; cpp+h, perhaps also an inl, and you typically don't work on only one file in isolation. I often have a disassembly view visible next to the code. My editor environment spans 2 monitors, with 4 files visible at any given time, and I would struggle to work in a more restrictive environment than that.<br/>I also miss being able to grab a tab and rip it out into a small floating window, which I often set to 'always on top', which is generally used a reference point, or something which I'm doing a lot of copy/pasing to/from.Right now for example, I'm trying to refactor and simplify some legacy code; my current working set of files is... component.cpp, component.h, component.inl, componentimpl.cpp, componentimpl.h, icomponent.h. That's 6 files! And I can't escape from the occasional tweak of some other files on the periphery. I use ctrl-tab liberally when I'm working on that style of project (flipping between 2 files), but in this context/codebase, I simply can't work without tabs.Refactoring and maintaining legacy code has a very different workflow from writing new code (which I imagine you guys are doing, and using mostly as a guideline for UX design).My point here is; there's a modern desire to reinvent everything, and we have seen huge strides in UX design in recent years; vscode already presents some of these, but be careful and apply good judgement when deciding to change the way people have been working for decades. Many established designs are established because they are good and efficient, not because they are old and need updating to be more trendy :)I would appreciate the opportunity to be part of these focus studies!",

Actually i can't work without tabs. I'm working with tabs system since years, and without them, i'm really lost.

Being able to take a file and drag it out into a new window is clearly not a benefit of a tab system, it is a feature which you can have without tabs.Is it that people really want to open files in tabs, move them around and close them eventually? Is this because you are so used to it or is there actually a value in doing so? Is the value being able to set an active working file set that you later on dismiss to start something new? I wonder what is so good in having tabs that you cannot achieve with another way of representation. And I am not accepting the argument that everyone is used to tabs :). A lot of people are used to saving files and still there are editors with auto save capability and people seem to like it.",
"<relative-time class=""no-wrap"" datetime=""2015-12-23T09:05:51Z"">Dec 23, 2015</relative-time>","Even if it is not by default, giving the user the choice to activate the tabs feature through some option would be almost as good for me.For example, what about letting the user move/drag the ""working Files"" section to the top (converting them into tabs lets say).

"<relative-time class=""no-wrap"" datetime=""2015-12-23T16:00:59Z"">Dec 23, 2015</relative-time>","For me it's not so much the appearance of tabs as the behavior of them that I miss.  (For example, you can get Sublime Text to look kind of like VS Code in that you can hide the tab bar and show the open files in the sidebar instead...but they still behave exactly like the tabs do.)The first thing I ever do with VS Code is swap its close file and close active editor keyboard shortcuts, so that ctrl+W actually closes a file when I press it, rather than still leaving it in working files and cluttering up ctrl+tab.But even then, every time I close a file, I am greeted with a blank screen and have to ctrl+tab just to show the most recent still-open working file (heck, when it's the last one, I seem to also need to hit enter after ctrl+tab; not sure what that's about).  In any other editor, I'd immediately be greeted by either the most recent or adjacent open file (tab) upon closing the current one.Additionally, ctrl+tab between working files appears to work in most-recent order, as opposed to tabs which usually operate in the order they appear or are arranged.  (I've seen some editors support both.)I don't use split windows, so if any of these behavioral differences have anything to do with that, it's lost on me.  Maybe I'd understand it better if I understood it from that angle, but wouldn't no-split still be the most common use case?At any rate, it's small but frequent bits of friction like these that keep me away from VS Code and going back to other editors.  Yes, you could say it's that VS Code operates differently from what I'm used to.  But when what I'm used to works, and VS Code operating differently causes friction that I'd sooner use a different editor to avoid having to deal with, it's kind of a big deal.",

"['Dec 21, 2015']","Thanks very much for the feedback.We have an issue on our UX backlog (#1133) to improve workspace management (managing open files, history etc) which this would be a piece of. Our intention is to improve the experience such that managing the list of open and recent files is straightforward and easy and allows the user to focus on their code, without having to pay any undue attention to the VS Code UI.Our hypothesis is that the current system has some rough edges (e.g., closing an editor actually closes the editor, but we think that perhaps it should instead show the file that was previously open in that same editor) and that smoothing out these rough edges will help create a far better experience.We do UX studies on the product on a very regular basis. In fact, that's how we design a lot of the UX in the product. We iterate over our designs based on real feedback making sure that we use a great understanding of what people do and want to do with the product to inform our designs.If you would like to participate in these studies in the future (we won't be running any again until mid January at the earliest) let me know and I will add your name to the list.","['https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1133', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1133']"

"['Dec 23, 2015']","I do not think tabs are a good way to show the list of open files unless you manage these things actively and close them.Tab management is an unconscious and uninhibiting part of my development. VS-proper has small discreet tabs, which are unintrusive (vscode already has the filename taking up space where the tab would otherwise be). I do agree that runaway tab spam is a problem, it might be nice to innovate and address this, but I'd say that's lower priority than having tabs at all. VSCode needs to reach a minimum working state. Right now, I find it's getting very close, but I can't quite work productively yet. Starting with established patterns would probably get us working sooner.It's worth keeping in mind that not everyone is a web developer, I find that patterns and workflow tends to be slightly different for different languages and styles of application. As a native developer, it is common to have a set of associated files visible; cpp+h, perhaps also an inl, and you typically don't work on only one file in isolation. I often have a disassembly view visible next to the code. My editor environment spans 2 monitors, with 4 files visible at any given time, and I would struggle to work in a more restrictive environment than that.I also miss being able to grab a tab and rip it out into a small floating window, which I often set to 'always on top', which is generally used a reference point, or something which I'm doing a lot of copy/pasing to/from.Right now for example, I'm trying to refactor and simplify some legacy code; my current working set of files is... component.cpp, component.h, component.inl, componentimpl.cpp, componentimpl.h, icomponent.h. That's 6 files! And I can't escape from the occasional tweak of some other files on the periphery. I use ctrl-tab liberally when I'm working on that style of project (flipping between 2 files), but in this context/codebase, I simply can't work without tabs.Refactoring and maintaining legacy code has a very different workflow from writing new code (which I imagine you guys are doing, and using mostly as a guideline for UX design).My point here is; there's a modern desire to reinvent everything, and we have seen huge strides in UX design in recent years; vscode already presents some of these, but be careful and apply good judgement when deciding to change the way people have been working for decades. Many established designs are established because they are good and efficient, not because they are old and need updating to be more trendy :)I would appreciate the opportunity to be part of these focus studies!",
"['Dec 23, 2015']","My point here is; there's a modern desire to reinvent everything, and we have seen huge strides in UX design in recent years; vscode already presents some of these, but be careful and apply good judgement when deciding to change the way people have been working for decades.It's the case for me. Actually i can't work without tabs. I'm working with tabs system since years, and without them, i'm really lost. This is one of the reason i'm not using Code actually.Many established designs are established because they are good and efficient, not because they are old and need updating to be more trendy :)",
"['Dec 23, 2015']","So far I have not yet heard a good reason for tabs compared to having just a list of ""working files"" somewhere. Being able to take a file and drag it out into a new window is clearly not a benefit of a tab system, it is a feature which you can have without tabs.Is it that people really want to open files in tabs, move them around and close them eventually? Is this because you are so used to it or is there actually a value in doing so? Is the value being able to set an active working file set that you later on dismiss to start something new? I wonder what is so good in having tabs that you cannot achieve with another way of representation. And I am not accepting the argument that everyone is used to tabs :). A lot of people are used to saving files and still there are editors with auto save capability and people seem to like it.",
"['Dec 23, 2015']","Even if it is not by default, giving the user the choice to activate the tabs feature through some option would be almost as good for me.For example, what about letting the user move/drag the ""working Files"" section to the top (converting them into tabs lets say). Again, the user may choose how he wants to work and I think that is great!",
"['Dec 23, 2015']","For me it's not so much the appearance of tabs as the behavior of them that I miss.  (For example, you can get Sublime Text to look kind of like VS Code in that you can hide the tab bar and show the open files in the sidebar instead...but they still behave exactly like the tabs do.)The first thing I ever do with VS Code is swap its close file and close active editor keyboard shortcuts, so that ctrl+W actually closes a file when I press it, rather than still leaving it in working files and cluttering up ctrl+tab.But even then, every time I close a file, I am greeted with a blank screen and have to ctrl+tab just to show the most recent still-open working file (heck, when it's the last one, I seem to also need to hit enter after ctrl+tab; not sure what that's about).  In any other editor, I'd immediately be greeted by either the most recent or adjacent open file (tab) upon closing the current one.Additionally, ctrl+tab between working files appears to work in most-recent order, as opposed to tabs which usually operate in the order they appear or are arranged.  (I've seen some editors support both.)I don't use split windows, so if any of these behavioral differences have anything to do with that, it's lost on me.  Maybe I'd understand it better if I understood it from that angle, but wouldn't no-split still be the most common use case?At any rate, it's small but frequent bits of friction like these that keep me away from VS Code and going back to other editors.  Yes, you could say it's that VS Code operates differently from what I'm used to.  But when what I'm used to works, and VS Code operating differently causes friction that I'd sooner use a different editor to avoid having to deal with, it's kind of a big deal.",
"['Dec 23, 2015']","Yes, I can see a model where the editor area behaves similar to tabs without showing tabs. We want to explore this next year.Btw there is an extension that - once you close an editor - opens the next one from working files. If you combine that with changing the keybinding as @kfranqueiro suggests, you get pretty close imho.",

After updating I didn't see the updated stacks and had to re-read the text a few times.To me it says that Tabs will take more iterations (so no tabs in this update), but that in May you made great progress on how to manage stacks of editors (so despite there being no tabs, updated stacks are in this update?) and that there is more work to be done for the June release branch (to improve stacks even further?).So to anyone who may have been confused like I was.. looks like updated stacks are not actually in this update.

"['Dec 23, 2015']","For me it's not so much the appearance of tabs as the behavior of them that I miss.  (For example, you can get Sublime Text to look kind of like VS Code in that you can hide the tab bar and show the open files in the sidebar instead...but they still behave exactly like the tabs do.)The first thing I ever do with VS Code is swap its close file and close active editor keyboard shortcuts, so that ctrl+W actually closes a file when I press it, rather than still leaving it in working files and cluttering up ctrl+tab.But even then, every time I close a file, I am greeted with a blank screen and have to ctrl+tab just to show the most recent still-open working file (heck, when it's the last one, I seem to also need to hit enter after ctrl+tab; not sure what that's about).  In any other editor, I'd immediately be greeted by either the most recent or adjacent open file (tab) upon closing the current one.Additionally, ctrl+tab between working files appears to work in most-recent order, as opposed to tabs which usually operate in the order they appear or are arranged.  (I've seen some editors support both.)I don't use split windows, so if any of these behavioral differences have anything to do with that, it's lost on me.  Maybe I'd understand it better if I understood it from that angle, but wouldn't no-split still be the most common use case?At any rate, it's small but frequent bits of friction like these that keep me away from VS Code and going back to other editors.  Yes, you could say it's that VS Code operates differently from what I'm used to.  But when what I'm used to works, and VS Code operating differently causes friction that I'd sooner use a different editor to avoid having to deal with, it's kind of a big deal.",
"['Dec 23, 2015']","Yes, I can see a model where the editor area behaves similar to tabs without showing tabs. We want to explore this next year.Btw there is an extension that - once you close an editor - opens the next one from working files.

"['Dec 21, 2015']",Yes. But the file remains in the Ctrl+tab context even after closing the file. The experience is not the same as that of Sublime / Atom.,
"['Dec 21, 2015']","@snehilmodani right, would it help if the list was showing only what you have in the working files section of the explorer? can you work with the working files list at least?",
"['Dec 21, 2015']",That would be great!On a side note: Isn't a layout with file names as tabs more user friendly. It is extensible to having one or more sections of tabs each with their own set of opened files. (Again i am taking Sublime Text as reference here),
"['Dec 21, 2015']","I think having tabs or not is independent from having sections. Today you can open up to 3 editors side by side in VS Code and thus we do have sections. Since we do not have tabs, we do not add multiple files into these sections and you can also not have empty sections (which is a separate UX discussion).Coming back to Ctrl+Tab: We in the team have always worked without tabs from day one and actually we did not even have the working files view for a long time and in fact not so many people in the team are using it. We found that for us it does not matter that much which file you had open or closed. Our minds are rather thinking about the chronological order of which file we edited last. So when I bring up Ctrl+Tab it will typically show me those files I was in last. I am not really looking at the number of files in there, I am only interested in the Top 5 ones at max. The advantage of this model is that you do not have to manage layouts and tabs at all. The management happens naturally while you navigate between files.We can add a file picker for working files, but it would be interesting to hear if people can be convinced to use Ctrl+Tab as it is today and learn what the issues are.",
"['Dec 21, 2015']","@bpasero I'll give ctrl+tab a shot, I just realized it can be used for going by to the previous file which is something I wanted and hadn't looked into yet until now. So that's nice.By the way, regardless of whether one can get by / used to ctrl+tab as an alternative to tabs, new VS code users will probably be put off by the lack of tabs, so if only for marketshare reasons I'd recommend having a tabs option. Every other editor uses tabs (for better or worse), and not having them introduces a rather unnecessary entry barrier to VS code. I'm using VS code regardless of tab support because of its awesome typescript support, but if it wasn't for that I don't know if I would have kept at it the first few times I tried it.",
"['Dec 21, 2015']","Yes, Ctrl+Tab is all about navigating back in history of files being worked on. You can press and hold the Ctrl key and press Tab repeated times to go back beyond 1 file.",

"['Dec 21, 2015']","For those that are missing tabs, have you tried using Ctrl+Tab to navigate in the history of opened files?",
"['Dec 21, 2015']",Yes. But the file remains in the Ctrl+tab context even after closing the file. The experience is not the same as that of Sublime / Atom.,
"['Dec 21, 2015']","@snehilmodani right, would it help if the list was showing only what you have in the working files section of the explorer? can you work with the working files list at least?",
"['Dec 21, 2015']",That would be great!On a side note: Isn't a layout with file names as tabs more user friendly. It is extensible to having one or more sections of tabs each with their own set of opened files. (Again i am taking Sublime Text as reference here),
"['Dec 21, 2015']","I think having tabs or not is independent from having sections. Today you can open up to 3 editors side by side in VS Code and thus we do have sections. Since we do not have tabs, we do not add multiple files into these sections and you can also not have empty sections (which is a separate UX discussion).Coming back to Ctrl+Tab: We in the team have always worked without tabs from day one and actually we did not even have the working files view for a long time and in fact not so many people in the team are using it. We found that for us it does not matter that much which file you had open or closed. Our minds are rather thinking about the chronological order of which file we edited last. So when I bring up Ctrl+Tab it will typically show me those files I was in last. I am not really looking at the number of files in there, I am only interested in the Top 5 ones at max. The advantage of this model is that you do not have to manage layouts and tabs at all. The management happens naturally while you navigate between files.We can add a file picker for working files, but it would be interesting to hear if people can be convinced to use Ctrl+Tab as it is today and learn what the issues are.",
"['Dec 21, 2015']","@bpasero I'll give ctrl+tab a shot, I just realized it can be used for going by to the previous file which is something I wanted and hadn't looked into yet until now. So that's nice.By the way, regardless of whether one can get by / used to ctrl+tab as an alternative to tabs, new VS code users will probably be put off by the lack of tabs, so if only for marketshare reasons I'd recommend having a tabs option. Every other editor uses tabs (for better or worse), and not having them introduces a rather unnecessary entry barrier to VS code. I'm using VS code regardless of tab support because of its awesome typescript support, but if it wasn't for that I don't know if I would have kept at it the first few times I tried it.",
"['Dec 21, 2015']","Yes, Ctrl+Tab is all about navigating back in history of files being worked on. You can press and hold the Ctrl key and press Tab repeated times to go back beyond 1 file.",
"['Dec 21, 2015']",Ctrl+tab is a wonderful thing to have and I totally am a fan of it. It is something even Atom misses out on.Regarding Tabs and multiple files in each sections: Even in Sublime Text we can open 3 editors side by side but they still offer a sectional tabbed layout. I agree with you on the clutter and managing the layout of the editor would be quite a task but people are used to that anyways.I would love to be a part of a social experiment where you are trying to convince us to get rid of our cluttered layout based interactions with our editors.,
"['Dec 21, 2015']",I agree with you on the clutter and managing the layout of the editor would be quite a task but people are used to that anyways.Well I am sure we can find more UX examples where we used to be used to something and then we got used to something a lot better :).

"['Dec 21, 2015']",I do not think tabs are a good way to show the list of open files unless you manage these things actively and close them.Some people actually manage them and for others there is close tabs to the right.,
"['Dec 21, 2015']","Thanks very much for the feedback.We have an issue on our UX backlog (#1133) to improve workspace management (managing open files, history etc) which this would be a piece of. Our intention is to improve the experience such that managing the list of open and recent files is straightforward and easy and allows the user to focus on their code, without having to pay any undue attention to the VS Code UI.Our hypothesis is that the current system has some rough edges (e.g., closing an editor actually closes the editor, but we think that perhaps it should instead show the file that was previously open in that same editor) and that smoothing out these rough edges will help create a far better experience.We do UX studies on the product on a very regular basis. In fact, that's how we design a lot of the UX in the product. We iterate over our designs based on real feedback making sure that we use a great understanding of what people do and want to do with the product to inform our designs.If you would like to participate in these studies in the future (we won't be running any again until mid January at the earliest) let me know and I will add your name to the list.","['https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1133', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1133']"

"['Dec 23, 2015']","I do not think tabs are a good way to show the list of open files unless you manage these things actively and close them.Tab management is an unconscious and uninhibiting part of my development. VS-proper has small discreet tabs, which are unintrusive (vscode already has the filename taking up space where the tab would otherwise be). I do agree that runaway tab spam is a problem, it might be nice to innovate and address this, but I'd say that's lower priority than having tabs at all. VSCode needs to reach a minimum working state. Right now, I find it's getting very close, but I can't quite work productively yet. Starting with established patterns would probably get us working sooner.It's worth keeping in mind that not everyone is a web developer, I find that patterns and workflow tends to be slightly different for different languages and styles of application. As a native developer, it is common to have a set of associated files visible; cpp+h, perhaps also an inl, and you typically don't work on only one file in isolation. I often have a disassembly view visible next to the code. My editor environment spans 2 monitors, with 4 files visible at any given time, and I would struggle to work in a more restrictive environment than that.I also miss being able to grab a tab and rip it out into a small floating window, which I often set to 'always on top', which is generally used a reference point, or something which I'm doing a lot of copy/pasing to/from.Right now for example, I'm trying to refactor and simplify some legacy code; my current working set of files is... component.cpp, component.h, component.inl, componentimpl.cpp, componentimpl.h, icomponent.h. That's 6 files! And I can't escape from the occasional tweak of some other files on the periphery. I use ctrl-tab liberally when I'm working on that style of project (flipping between 2 files), but in this context/codebase, I simply can't work without tabs.Refactoring and maintaining legacy code has a very different workflow from writing new code (which I imagine you guys are doing, and using mostly as a guideline for UX design).My point here is; there's a modern desire to reinvent everything, and we have seen huge strides in UX design in recent years; vscode already presents some of these, but be careful and apply good judgement when deciding to change the way people have been working for decades. Many established designs are established because they are good and efficient, not because they are old and need updating to be more trendy :)I would appreciate the opportunity to be part of these focus studies!",

Actually i can't work without tabs. I'm working with tabs system since years, and without them, i'm really lost.

"['Dec 23, 2015']","So far I have not yet heard a good reason for tabs compared to having just a list of ""working files"" somewhere. Being able to take a file and drag it out into a new window is clearly not a benefit of a tab system, it is a feature which you can have without tabs.Is it that people really want to open files in tabs, move them around and close them eventually? Is this because you are so used to it or is there actually a value in doing so? Is the value being able to set an active working file set that you later on dismiss to start something new? I wonder what is so good in having tabs that you cannot achieve with another way of representation. And I am not accepting the argument that everyone is used to tabs :). A lot of people are used to saving files and still there are editors with auto save capability and people seem to like it.",
"['Dec 23, 2015']","Even if it is not by default, giving the user the choice to activate the tabs feature through some option would be almost as good for me.For example, what about letting the user move/drag the ""working Files"" section to the top (converting them into tabs lets say).

"['Nov 19, 2015']","I really miss proper tabs for open files (like VS proper), and the ability to rip a tab out into its own window.",
"['Nov 20, 2015']",+1Would it be possible to add tabs through a custom extension? I quickly looked at the docs but didn't seem possible to add that type of functionality with the current API,
"['Nov 20, 2015']","Would it be possible to add tabs through a custom extension?No, this is currently not possible from an extension (see also http://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/our-approach)",

"['Dec 21, 2015']",,
"['Dec 21, 2015']","+1Tabs are the default way to work even in Visual Studio, to not mention other text editors such as sublime.",
"['Dec 21, 2015']","For those that are missing tabs, have you tried using Ctrl+Tab to navigate in the history of opened files?",
"['Dec 21, 2015']",Yes. But the file remains in the Ctrl+tab context even after closing the file. The experience is not the same as that of Sublime / Atom.,
"['Dec 21, 2015']","@snehilmodani right, would it help if the list was showing only what you have in the working files section of the explorer? can you work with the working files list at least?",
"['Dec 21, 2015']",That would be great!On a side note: Isn't a layout with file names as tabs more user friendly. It is extensible to having one or more sections of tabs each with their own set of opened files. (Again i am taking Sublime Text as reference here),
"['Dec 21, 2015']","I think having tabs or not is independent from having sections. Today you can open up to 3 editors side by side in VS Code and thus we do have sections. Since we do not have tabs, we do not add multiple files into these sections and you can also not have empty sections (which is a separate UX discussion).Coming back to Ctrl+Tab: We in the team have always worked without tabs from day one and actually we did not even have the working files view for a long time and in fact not so many people in the team are using it. We found that for us it does not matter that much which file you had open or closed. Our minds are rather thinking about the chronological order of which file we edited last. So when I bring up Ctrl+Tab it will typically show me those files I was in last. I am not really looking at the number of files in there, I am only interested in the Top 5 ones at max. The advantage of this model is that you do not have to manage layouts and tabs at all. The management happens naturally while you navigate between files.We can add a file picker for working files, but it would be interesting to hear if people can be convinced to use Ctrl+Tab as it is today and learn what the issues are.",
"['Dec 21, 2015']","@bpasero I'll give ctrl+tab a shot, I just realized it can be used for going by to the previous file which is something I wanted and hadn't looked into yet until now. So that's nice.By the way, regardless of whether one can get by / used to ctrl+tab as an alternative to tabs, new VS code users will probably be put off by the lack of tabs, so if only for marketshare reasons I'd recommend having a tabs option. Every other editor uses tabs (for better or worse), and not having them introduces a rather unnecessary entry barrier to VS code. I'm using VS code regardless of tab support because of its awesome typescript support, but if it wasn't for that I don't know if I would have kept at it the first few times I tried it.",
"['Dec 21, 2015']","Yes, Ctrl+Tab is all about navigating back in history of files being worked on. You can press and hold the Ctrl key and press Tab repeated times to go back beyond 1 file.",
"['Dec 21, 2015']",Ctrl+tab is a wonderful thing to have and I totally am a fan of it. It is something even Atom misses out on.Regarding Tabs and multiple files in each sections: Even in Sublime Text we can open 3 editors side by side but they still offer a sectional tabbed layout. I agree with you on the clutter and managing the layout of the editor would be quite a task but people are used to that anyways.I would love to be a part of a social experiment where you are trying to convince us to get rid of our cluttered layout based interactions with our editors.,
"['Dec 21, 2015']",I agree with you on the clutter and managing the layout of the editor would be quite a task but people are used to that anyways.Well I am sure we can find more UX examples where we used to be used to something and then we got used to something a lot better :). Think mobile phone keyboard vs smartphone touch interaction.I would love to be a part of a social experiment where you are trying to convince us to get rid of our cluttered layout based interactions with our editors.Yes I think we will need to do something like this 2016. @stevencl fyi,
"['Dec 21, 2015']","Regarding Tabs and multiple files in each sections: Even in Sublime Text we can open 3 editors side by side but they still offer a sectional tabbed layout.I agree on an option to allow for more stable sections so that we can have empty sections, but being able to see tabs in this section is just a visual representation of the files in there which in most cases grows so much that you end up not seeing anything. I do not think tabs are a good way to show the list of open files unless you manage these things actively and close them.",
"['Dec 21, 2015']",I do not think tabs are a good way to show the list of open files unless you manage these things actively and close them.Some people actually manage them and for others there is close tabs to the right.,
"['Dec 21, 2015']","Thanks very much for the feedback.We have an issue on our UX backlog (#1133) to improve workspace management (managing open files, history etc) which this would be a piece of. Our intention is to improve the experience such that managing the list of open and recent files is straightforward and easy and allows the user to focus on their code, without having to pay any undue attention to the VS Code UI.Our hypothesis is that the current system has some rough edges (e.g., closing an editor actually closes the editor, but we think that perhaps it should instead show the file that was previously open in that same editor) and that smoothing out these rough edges will help create a far better experience.We do UX studies on the product on a very regular basis. In fact, that's how we design a lot of the UX in the product. We iterate over our designs based on real feedback making sure that we use a great understanding of what people do and want to do with the product to inform our designs.If you would like to participate in these studies in the future (we won't be running any again until mid January at the earliest) let me know and I will add your name to the list.","['https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1133', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1133']"

"['Dec 23, 2015']","I do not think tabs are a good way to show the list of open files unless you manage these things actively and close them.Tab management is an unconscious and uninhibiting part of my development. VS-proper has small discreet tabs, which are unintrusive (vscode already has the filename taking up space where the tab would otherwise be). I do agree that runaway tab spam is a problem, it might be nice to innovate and address this, but I'd say that's lower priority than having tabs at all. VSCode needs to reach a minimum working state. Right now, I find it's getting very close, but I can't quite work productively yet. Starting with established patterns would probably get us working sooner.It's worth keeping in mind that not everyone is a web developer, I find that patterns and workflow tends to be slightly different for different languages and styles of application. As a native developer, it is common to have a set of associated files visible; cpp+h, perhaps also an inl, and you typically don't work on only one file in isolation. I often have a disassembly view visible next to the code. My editor environment spans 2 monitors, with 4 files visible at any given time, and I would struggle to work in a more restrictive environment than that.I also miss being able to grab a tab and rip it out into a small floating window, which I often set to 'always on top', which is generally used a reference point, or something which I'm doing a lot of copy/pasing to/from.Right now for example, I'm trying to refactor and simplify some legacy code; my current working set of files is... component.cpp, component.h, component.inl, componentimpl.cpp, componentimpl.h, icomponent.h. That's 6 files! And I can't escape from the occasional tweak of some other files on the periphery. I use ctrl-tab liberally when I'm working on that style of project (flipping between 2 files), but in this context/codebase, I simply can't work without tabs.Refactoring and maintaining legacy code has a very different workflow from writing new code (which I imagine you guys are doing, and using mostly as a guideline for UX design).My point here is; there's a modern desire to reinvent everything, and we have seen huge strides in UX design in recent years; vscode already presents some of these, but be careful and apply good judgement when deciding to change the way people have been working for decades. Many established designs are established because they are good and efficient, not because they are old and need updating to be more trendy :)I would appreciate the opportunity to be part of these focus studies!",
"['Dec 23, 2015']","My point here is; there's a modern desire to reinvent everything, and we have seen huge strides in UX design in recent years; vscode already presents some of these, but be careful and apply good judgement when deciding to change the way people have been working for decades.It's the case for me. Actually i can't work without tabs. I'm working with tabs system since years, and without them, i'm really lost. This is one of the reason i'm not using Code actually.Many established designs are established because they are good and efficient, not because they are old and need updating to be more trendy :)",
"['Dec 23, 2015']","So far I have not yet heard a good reason for tabs compared to having just a list of ""working files"" somewhere. Being able to take a file and drag it out into a new window is clearly not a benefit of a tab system, it is a feature which you can have without tabs.Is it that people really want to open files in tabs, move them around and close them eventually? Is this because you are so used to it or is there actually a value in doing so? Is the value being able to set an active working file set that you later on dismiss to start something new? I wonder what is so good in having tabs that you cannot achieve with another way of representation. And I am not accepting the argument that everyone is used to tabs :). A lot of people are used to saving files and still there are editors with auto save capability and people seem to like it.",
"['Dec 23, 2015']","Even if it is not by default, giving the user the choice to activate the tabs feature through some option would be almost as good for me.For example, what about letting the user move/drag the ""working Files"" section to the top (converting them into tabs lets say). Again, the user may choose how he wants to work and I think that is great!",
"['Dec 23, 2015']","For me it's not so much the appearance of tabs as the behavior of them that I miss.  (For example, you can get Sublime Text to look kind of like VS Code in that you can hide the tab bar and show the open files in the sidebar instead...but they still behave exactly like the tabs do.)The first thing I ever do with VS Code is swap its close file and close active editor keyboard shortcuts, so that ctrl+W actually closes a file when I press it, rather than still leaving it in working files and cluttering up ctrl+tab.But even then, every time I close a file, I am greeted with a blank screen and have to ctrl+tab just to show the most recent still-open working file (heck, when it's the last one, I seem to also need to hit enter after ctrl+tab; not sure what that's about).  In any other editor, I'd immediately be greeted by either the most recent or adjacent open file (tab) upon closing the current one.Additionally, ctrl+tab between working files appears to work in most-recent order, as opposed to tabs which usually operate in the order they appear or are arranged.  (I've seen some editors support both.)I don't use split windows, so if any of these behavioral differences have anything to do with that, it's lost on me.  Maybe I'd understand it better if I understood it from that angle, but wouldn't no-split still be the most common use case?At any rate, it's small but frequent bits of friction like these that keep me away from VS Code and going back to other editors.  Yes, you could say it's that VS Code operates differently from what I'm used to.  But when what I'm used to works, and VS Code operating differently causes friction that I'd sooner use a different editor to avoid having to deal with, it's kind of a big deal.",
"['Dec 23, 2015']","Yes, I can see a model where the editor area behaves similar to tabs without showing tabs. We want to explore this next year.Btw there is an extension that - once you close an editor - opens the next one from working files. If you combine that with changing the keybinding as @kfranqueiro suggests, you get pretty close imho.",
