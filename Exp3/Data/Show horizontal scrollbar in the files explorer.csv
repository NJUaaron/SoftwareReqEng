"['Nov 15, 2016']","VSCode Version: 1.7.1It would be nice to have horizontal scroll on explorer sidebar, especially when you are working on a project with deeply nested files",
"['Feb 14, 2017']","This is a huge User experience penalty for me. Especially when i have files that have similar starting names.Right now, i have to manually drag the ""Text Editor"" area whenever i want to look for specific file names.Atom allows us to scroll horizontally within the ""explorer"". I don't understand why VSCode does not have a basic UI like this.Hope to see it soon!",
"['Mar 6, 2017']",Im also in favour of this idea.In the meantime i'm working around it by having a large explorer but hiding/showing it with Cmd + B (Windows is Ctrl + B). You can also open the explorer window with Cmd+Shift+E and switch to search with Cmd+Shift+F.  These might be useful for anyone else coming across this issue.These shortcuts combined with Cmd+P to jump straight to the file i'm after is proving good enough for now. Nevertheless I think having an (optional?) horizontal scroller would be a nice addition.,

"['Mar 8, 2018']",It has been almost a year and a half since this issue has been opened and hundreds of people have been requesting this. @RMacfarlane @bpasero @isidorn Why does this keep getting blown off? People clearly want this and are repeatedly asking for it. Look how many duplicate issues there are for this. Why can you not prioritize one of the biggest and most asked for issues that your users are experiencing? Can this please be added in the next release? Please listen to your users.,
"['Mar 8, 2018']","This can't be even called a ""feature request"", it is an basic UI Design flaw, plain and simple.Shame on you Microsoft..",
