"Aug 11, 2017","I tried this on Windows and unfortunately it doesn't work (so Electron's API for this must still be supported on only MacOS). However I did find an npm package named electron-vibrancy that supports Windows 10 and got the following results:I had to disable the window frame because the vibrancy effect doesn't play well with it, so if this were to be implemented for Windows too some kind of custom titlebar would need to be added. I think there's already an open issue for that.I don't know if there's any way to get more of a blur like @lestad's pictures which still look much better than I was able to get, but it's a step closer.",
"Aug 12, 2017","@lestad followed your steps and cannot make it work, care to open a PR for me to test it out? Do I need to enable something in macOS to see it?",
"Sep 23, 2017","@rianadon that's because it's using the undocumented SetWindowCompositionAttribute function in Windows. No you can't have a higher blur radius. BTW what you suggest is missing shadows, and you can't resize it by grabbing the window borders because you used transparent: true.Here's an example with Discord:If you look near the Explorer window, you can see the shadow is still there. The window was created with the following options:    var mainWindowOptions = {      title: ""Discord"",      backgroundColor: '#00000000',      width: DEFAULT_WIDTH,      height: DEFAULT_HEIGHT,      minWidth: MIN_WIDTH,      minHeight: MIN_HEIGHT,      transparent: false,      frame: false,      resizable: true,      show: isVisible,      thickFrame: true,      webPreferences: {        blinkFeatures: ""EnumerateDevices,AudioOutputDevices""      }    };And SetWindowCompositionAttribute was called like this:HWND hWnd = FindWindow(""Chrome_WidgetWin_1"", NULL);ACCENTPOLICY policy = { 3, 2, 0xaa000000, 0 }; // ACCENT_ENABLE_BLURBEHIND=3WINCOMPATTRDATA data = { 19, &amp;policy, sizeof(ACCENTPOLICY) }; // WCA_ACCENT_POLICY=19SetWindowCompositionAttribute(hWnd, &amp;data);So now after creating a window like this and calling the API, any zone of your app that is transparent will have the blur effect and you still keep the shadow and resize borders on the window. The only remaining matter would be implementing a titlebar and drag area (maximise, minimize and Aero Snap is handled by Windows, something that using transparent: true (which electron-vibrancy absolutely requires) would require us to implement it ourselves)I think a custom way for Windows would be better than using electron-vibrancy. However it seems fine to use it on macOS. BTW vibrancy support is now in official electron, so might as well completely drop electron-vibrancy: electron/electron#7898","['https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/7898', 'https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7898']"
"Oct 1, 2017","@sylveon My experiment was not a suggestion on the way VS Code should implement this; it was only to see if such a vibrancy effect was possible on Windows.I used electron-vibrancy as my Electron and Windows API knowledge is quite limited. But as you said it has a few major shortcomings, so, should this be done well, using it wouldn't be a good idea.I tried using options similar to what you suggested to get the effect with shadows, but for some reason the background of the window becomes solid black. I'm 99.9% sure I typed eight 0s.What Electron version did you use (maybe this matters?), and would you mind sharing the rest of the code the options are from?Thanks!",
"Oct 1, 2017","Unfortunately since this is a modification of Discord (a closed-source program), sharing the source code would potentially lead me into trouble.The background is solid black until you call SetWindowCompositionAttribute on it, only after it will become blurred:The program I used in my GIF comes from here: http://glass8.eu/files/SetWindowCompositionAttribute.7zElectron version of my Discord is 1.4.12BTW, if you want complete control of the blur's color via the application itself, use 0x00000000 (instead of 0xaa000000 or 0xdd000000) as the color for SetWindowCompositionAttribute then set the background color of your app via CSS/however you like. For example:body {    background-color: rgba(150, 0, 0, 0);}",[]
"Oct 1, 2017",Gotcha.It turns out I set the opacity of some elements to 80% and the dark color of the blur combined with the opacity made everything look black.Changing the blur color to 0x00000000 did the trick. However I still had to use 80% opacities to color the blur as setting the body background color to something with 0 opacity didn't change anything.Thanks for the help. I'd still have to wait for one of the many Windows custom titlebar issues to reach a consensus to do any more with this though.,
"Oct 1, 2017","Yeah a custom titlebar is required, because blur doesn't plays well with non-borderless windows:",
"Nov 23, 2017","Since it seems it will take a while for a consensus to be reached on what kind of titlebar VS Code should have, I went with the Metro app style and incorporated the color that's shown on macOS currently (since I was modifying the existing macOS custom titlebar anyways):@bpasero if this looks good I could write a PR for the titlebar on Windows.
