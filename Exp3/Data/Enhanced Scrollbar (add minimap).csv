"['Apr 1, 2016']","Feature RequestAdd the Enhanced Scrollbar feature from VS 2013 and VS 2015 into VS Code.  It's an extremely efficient way to move around within a file and would be a great feature to have in VS Code.If this is already an extension or an option, I could not find it.",
"['Apr 4, 2016']",@jschraub Can you please point out specific features you like or that help you move around more efficiently from the Enhanced Scrollbar of VS 2013/2015 ?,
"['Apr 4, 2016']","Absolutely, @alexandrudima. The ability to at a glance, get a visual representation of your document/code. Having a ""10,000 foot view"" makes it easy to glance at your document and immediately click into the piece of code for which you are looking. While the Enhanced Scroll bar from VS 2013/2015 offer more features than that, I don't use many of them.Many other code editors have similar features, including Sublime and Atom and they all have different sub-features, but I think having an offering for a ""10,000 foot view"" of your document at a quick glance, gives great advantage over Text Editors that do not have a corresponding feature.Please let me know if that is what you were looking for, or it you need better/different details.",
"['Apr 4, 2016']",Great description! Thank you!,
"['Sep 1, 2016']","Hi @alexandrudima , is anyone from VSCode working on this for the next release? Is this something that the community can contribute to the scrollbar?I'm guessing it will be some sort of reading the editor model and drawing a minimap representation of it in a canvas. wdyt?",
"['Sep 2, 2016']","@nojvek We will draft and release the September plan at the end of next week. Given this issue is climbing to the top of this query we use to track community requests (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc), it has a high change to make it on the September plan.Please stay tuned :)",
"['Sep 13, 2016']",Beta bits plz!  It's my favorite feature of and the only thing keeping me tethered to Sublime Text.,
"['Sep 13, 2016']",Soon™,
"['Sep 19, 2016']", the minimap feature is dearly missed,
"['Sep 19, 2016']",I miss it heavily too.,
"['Sep 20, 2016']",+Infinity,
"['Sep 23, 2016']","@+1 Minimap is one of the must-have feature for me, it works great on atom with many addons.",
"['Sep 23, 2016']",see kate's minimap which i see as a good example on this matter: https://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/applications/katepart/kate-part-scrollbar-minimap.html,
"['Oct 1, 2016']",+1 for the Minimap. A 'hold middle-mouse button' (scrollbar button) to scroll would be great too,
"['Oct 1, 2016']","If we have git status, errors, other occurrence of current word, find results, peek preview window indication, basically all Sublime's minimap has + all VSCode's current scrollbar has, it'll be huge!",
"['Oct 1, 2016']",I don't see why VS Code can't if VS can.,
"['Oct 3, 2016']",this would be a huge win and one of the last missing features for the sublime holdovers,
"['Oct 5, 2016']","I recently discovered the use, can't wait till it's implemented",
"['Oct 7, 2016']",+1 can't wait for this to be implemented in VSCode...,
"['Oct 7, 2016']",+1 Please add soon.,
"['Feb 21, 2017']",Thank you! Willing to see it stable!,
"['Feb 22, 2017']","Question: is it possible to have the minimap also be a cursor? This is the default behavior in VS, and this is what I see as the main differences between the 2 apps. Also note that I did install the insiders version to test it outEDITNevermind, just realized there's an open issue #20935 for that","['https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/20935', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/20935']"
"['Feb 25, 2017']","@alexandrudima Thanks for #20947. Is it possible to have  ""editor.minimap.renderCharacters"": false as the default to render block instead of text? IMO it looks much more pleasing and has better usability.","['https://github.com/alexandrudima', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/20947', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/20947']"
"['Feb 27, 2017']","I'd like to be able to zoom when I'm over the text or block (it depends on the final approach). Currently, I cannot read anything or know in which part of the code I am, this is useful if you're working on a large piece of code.Also, I discovered that if I keep the click and try scrolling or moving over the minimap nothing happens, I need to stop to click and choose another section of the code.",
"['Feb 27, 2017']","@FANMixco I was thinking about your petition, but I'm currently unsure about why you need such a feature, since if you click on the minimap, the code is scrolled to that point without moving the cursor, so it is effectively the same thing as a hover/zoom. Perhaps hovering is more efficient than clicking?",
"['Feb 27, 2017']","@druellan , I believe that @FANMixco is talking about a minimap zoom feature that is already in the regular Visual Studio as shown belowEDITForgot to mention that the zoom shows up only after staying over the minimap for 2sec. If you go over the minimap and start scrolling, the zoom won't show up, you really need to stop scrolling and wait 2sec to see it.",
"['Feb 27, 2017']","If @ghiscoding is right about @FANMixco feature, then it definitely should be optional, since I think many people (as I do) don't like popups.",
"['Feb 27, 2017']","Thanks @ghiscoding, now is more clear. I still kind of believe this is not a huge improvement over the click+slide mechanism, in fact, looks more useful WITHOUT the minimap, on the enhanced scrollbar itself. Kind of a stand-alone feature and not part of the minimap feature.About @pohmelie suggestion, I totally agree, but I believe this also can be attached to a shortkey modificator, like ctrl+hover on the scrollbar/minimap to trigger the function.",
"['Feb 28, 2017']","@druellan This is also the same as the https://atom.io/packages/minimap-codeglance extension on Atom. 11,000 downloads seems to suggest lots of people like/need it.Personally I do not, so if you do implement it, please make it optional. A trigger/hotkey mechanism does sound good though especially if it's implemented on the scrollbar as well as minimap.",
"['Mar 2, 2017']",Is there a way to toggle it like toggle-sidebar(ctrl-b) toggle-panel(ctrl-j) ?,
"['Mar 2, 2017']",I like the new minimap. One thing I'm missing is the highlighting of text found with search or find-duplicates. I attached two screenshots to visualize that matter.,
"['Mar 2, 2017']",Nice feature guys!,
"['Mar 2, 2017']","@sixenvi I suggest you to add to a separate feature request #21404 that I asked, since your request is very similar to mine and is an open issue, so at least it's tracked.I'm not sure that the VSCode team read comments or requests on issues that are closed, like this one here.",
"['Mar 3, 2017']","Hi @druellan ! Yeah, what @ghiscoding is what I meant, maybe we could configure about the time because it's a bit confuse.",
"['Mar 3, 2017']",Hi everyone! If VS Code just missed one feature it was this and now it's compelete! Such a nice implementation and great performance. (@alexandrudima as always you fascinate me!)Just one simple thing that I noticed:,

"['Mar 3, 2017']",@nojvek ah didn't notice that! okay one more issue...,
"['Mar 10, 2017']",One more thing would be great I think - do not hide current position on minimap (currently it is visible only on mouseover).Probably having one more key in settings for this would be best.,
