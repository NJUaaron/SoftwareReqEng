"['Jun 23, 2016']","+1, our icon set needs a champion that owns and fixes them. I would add on top that I was never a big fan of the icons we use in the activity bar...",
"['Jun 23, 2016']","@bpasero what in particular about the activity bar icons; size, style?",
"['Jun 23, 2016']","Yeah, activity bar could be smaller imho for what it provides. Basically all icons we use are pretty much 4 years old I would say, a general face lift might be cool to bring them all in sync.",
"['Jun 23, 2016']",It so happens that the we have some new icons in the works that match the new Microsoft Design Language (cleaner and more modern icons that use strokes instead of heavy-weight fills).,
"['Jun 23, 2016']","Great points @Tyriar. I think with our recent discussions around panels, colours etc that we should look at a UI and UX overhaul. We've built up enough UX and UI debt as the product has evolved that we need to address it.",
"['Jun 25, 2016']","I must also admit that I am not a big fan of the recently introduced icons in the integrated terminal:They do not seem to fit our other icon set at all. I also find the ""Hide"" icon questionable as one can easily confuse it with a dropdown menu.",
"['Jun 25, 2016']","@bpasero the consistency of the icons will be solved in time as @bgashler1 mentions this is the way we're heading (there may be 1 or 2 releases where they're inconsistent though). @bgashler1 actually came up with some pretty nice looking icons that featured a mini terminal (box around &gt;) and +/- symbols in the top corner, the argument against these was that the most important part of the icons (+/-) was the smallest.See #8018 for discussion on the new close icon.","['https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/8018', 'https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/8018']"
"['Jun 26, 2016']",@bpasero I totally hear you on the consistency issue.  What we could do is possibly get these icons ported into our old look (heavier stroke weight) to remain consistent while we await a new icon set.,

"['Sep 21, 2016']",@bgashler1 any update on this?,

"['Sep 25, 2017']","IMHO, aesthetics-wise, the icons are the worst part of the editor, by far. They should really be taken more seriously, this issue is more than 1 year old!Just look at the icons used for the ""Output"" panel:Pretty much everything that could have gone wrong did: inconsistent shades of gray, style and shapes (X icon), the maximize/un-maximize icon doesn't properly illustrate it's function, the ""toggle output scroll lock"" icon seems taken straight from an iOS password manager or something, I prefer to hide it via some custom CSS than to have it displayed to me.Also, the whole ""enlarge on click"" effect is pretty distracting, I cannot think of any other app that uses it. Just look at this and tell me if you find it pleasing to watch:",
"['Sep 26, 2017']","Thanks for your comments @fabiospampinato. Unfortunately we do not have the capacity right now to address the issues with the icons. At some point we hope to, but as you have quite rightly pointed out, this issue is over a year old.",

"['Nov 3, 2017']",Something we should also do when tackling this is sharing the icon image files across components so we don't have multiple of the same image loaded into memory.,
"['Nov 3, 2017']","Perhaps octicons should be extended with all the needed icons. This way they could also be used by extensions.One, albeit minor, problem this would solve: I needed a refresh icon for one extension I made, and I wanted to use the same one VSC uses, so I had to find the actual file and embed it with the extension. If that icon ever changes my extension's icon will feel inconsistent. If it could reference to what VSC uses this problem won't happen.The limitation of this is that all icons would have to be mono-colored, unless they are combined afterwards via CSS.",['https://octicons.github.com/']
