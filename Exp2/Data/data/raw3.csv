57183, syntax highlighting  Method sub types, I came up with this idea when I was testing a new IDE for Dark Basic   The Developer liked it so much he decided he wanted to do it  but in his case he had to learn more C   in order to rebuild his IDE to do it   Hopefully my suggestion would not be nearly as difficult for Eclipse Java Dark Basic is a Game Development language that is Procedural based  not object   As such it has slew  after slew of commands  keywords    There are so many that a few individuals in the DB community have made the recommendation of creating a Keywords2  Keywords3  etc       to keep 3 4 of your code from all looking like the same color  usually Bold Blue  do to all the keywords undergoing the same syntax Highlighting   But I had an idea that I think made a bit more sense   Instead of creating a few extra Keywords just to offload the main Keyword  in this case Keywords1  or the original set of command assigned to  Keyword     Why not create Keyword groups  say like 10 20 of them   You would then apply your syntax style  highlighting  and color to the group   Then you would assign basic keyword types to these groups EX   3D commands would be assigned to Keyword group1  Network and FTP commands to group2  Animation to group 3  and so on The basic concept was to get similar or  like  commands  such as the dozen or so network and FTP commands  in one Keyword group  and that group would be assigned a specific syntax style  highlight  color  etc       to make all those commands appear in your code with the same syntax highlighting and style Since Java keywords are not the center of action of the object  rather the methods are  I was thinking the same could also apply to Java code but based on the Methods  not the keywords   For example Keyword Group 1    gt  java io  java nio  All the Input Output methods Keyword Group 2    gt  java awt  All the 2D methods Keyword Group 3    gt  javax swing  All the 3D methods Keyword Group 4    gt  java net  All the Networking methods etc      Like my suggestion in Dark Basic  this will give the various methods of one basic type or another  its own distinct look  making it more noticeable and stand out better EX   Scanning through you code for your Network methods  are easier when you know all networking methods are Bold Gold  as apposed to the methods of Input Output which are bold green Brad ,3

219887, Viewers  ISelectionProvider events not triggered by TableViewer setItemCount  , Tested under 3 3 1 1 When using an SWT VIRTUAL style Table with a TableViewer and ILazyContentProvider  the usage pattern recommended in the JavaDoc is for the content provider to call TableViewer setItemCount   during updateElement    when necessary   This sequence is triggered by TableViewer setInput   and TableViewer refresh   If the TableViewer has selected elements  and one or more of these elements is no longer present after the refresh    the TableViewer should fire ISelectionChangedListener selectionChanged   with the updated selection   The trivial case is setItemCount 0   which should fire an event with StructuredSelection EMPTY In fact  no event is fired I have traced this to a faulty assumption in the implementation of StructuredViewer preservingSelection     This is the code    send out notification if old and new differISelection newSelection   getSelection   if   newSelection equals oldSelection        handleInvalidSelection oldSelection  newSelection   The problem is thAt some point after the UI thread finishes processing the current event and the main event pump loops again  Windows will attempt to redraw the Table  which will trigger SWT SetData   gt  ILazyContentProvider updateElement     gt  TableViewer setItemCount     At this point  we should expect Windows to notify us thIt s unclear to me whether this is a JFace or an SWT bug   I suspect SWT is the problem  but I have only observed the effects via JFace API   Perhaps Table setItemCount   needs to explicitly fire selection events in this case  since Windows is failing us here   Perhaps TableViewer setItemCount   needs to verify the selection state and fire the events  ,3

82621, ViewMgmt   RCP  Support for passing input data to views, Some views may need to work with data that customizes its runtime behavior  let s call these configurable or parameterized views  A good example is a configurable view th This view s configuration  data  may include parameters that specify what applet to display  where to find the applet s JAR files  as well as various other applet configuration information  Configurable views may be useful without a configuration  but in a limited capacity  That is  a configurable view may use reasonable defaults for its parameters if a configuration is not found  however  the effectiveness of the unconfigured view is dependent on the function the view provides  For example  a configurable applet view would not be very useful unless a configuration is found that specifies what applet to display  but a configurable web browser view that allows for its decorations  home page  favorites  etc  to be configured may be of some use  e g  browsing the internet  Eclipse 3 0 provides support for multiple instances of a view to be created and displayed within the same workbench page  All views have a unique identifier th Multiple instances of the same view are differentiated using a secondary ID  Multi views can serve as the basis for configurable views  however  they don t provide a mechanism of associating a configuration with a multi view instance A solution to this problem should consider the following  1  The configuration should be available prior to the createPartControl   method being called  2  Views should be able to access their configuration if it was added to a perspective with the org eclipse ui IPageLayout interface or programmatically launched with the org eclipse ui IWorkbenchPage showView String String int  method  3  The Object type of the configuration should be narrow  That is  the configuration should not be of type Object  The Object type is too general and not conducive to creating a generic system for creating and setting view configurations  One possible option is an IConfiguration interface that contains IConfigurationItem Objects  Each IConfigurationItem has a String name and 0 or more String values and optional child IConfigurationItems A couple of solutions to this problem are obvious and are as follows  1  For each method in the org eclipse ui IPageLayout interface that allows for a view to be added to a perspective create an overloaded method with the same signature but with the addition of the view s secondary ID  This will allow for the perspective creator to differentiate this view from other instances in that page  currently the secondary ID is null if added through IPageLayout   In addition  provide a repository where view configurations can be stored  This repository would use the combination of a view s unique identifier and secondary identifier to store a configuration  Configurations should be added to the repository before views are launched and a protected method could be added to the org eclipse ui part ViewPart class that allows for a View to easily obtain it s configuration This solution meets all of the above requirements with a minimum amount of changes to Eclipse 3 0 1 source  I ve implemented it   Shortcomings include that the configuration must be created and set prior to the view being created and there is no way to change the configuration after it s been set  unless you add a listener interface  2  Add a method to the org eclipse ui IViewPart interface to set the configuration  e g  setConfiguration  lt some type   or use the existing setInitializationData   method  This would require larger changes to the Eclipse code base  Much like solution  1  this would require additional methods to be added to the IPageLayout interface but instead of adding a String parameter for the view s secondary identifier it would be the configuration Object  and maybe the secondary identifier too   In addition  a way of obtaining a reference to the ViewPart prior to it s createPartControl   method being called would have to be added if launching a view programatically  e g  IWorkbenchPage showView    This solution can satisfy all of the above requirements but would require more code changes than the first solution especially when launching a view programmatically  ,3

385287,Consider improving changing wait feedback during ajax requests, Currently the UI will give no immediate feedback th In my opinion this is not ideal because 1  Often the rendering of the response takes longer than the request itself  So the time until the UI changes after a user interaction may well be over 500ms without any feedback 2  If a request really takes a long time  lets say more than 3 seconds   the user can continue to interact with the UI  which he will becauser users are inpatient  As a result then next request may contain several events UI updates  and all potentially based on an outdated UI state 3  The wait cursor is not visible on tablets I would suggest to always change the cursor to a wait icon immediately   So it may appear to ficker a bit sometimes  i would not consider this a problem   Alternatively  it could change the cursor if the response contains more than a certain number of operations  predicting a longer time for rendering Also  i think we should consider to show a wait popup  with an document overlay  if the request runs longer than 3 5 seconds  This also happens in windows 7 if an application becomes unresponsive  Usually this should never be seen by the user  as the application developer should use UI callback for operations thSince the code for much of this is already in place  the changes would be relatively small On a related note  certain widgets could show some kind of wait hint if they  know  th Other places where this could done is when tree items are resolved or when switching in a tabfolder  ,3
