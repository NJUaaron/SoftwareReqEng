114269, jobs  Customizable job scheduling priorities, I realize that the Job doc says  There is no guarantee that jobs of one priority will be run before all jobs of lower priority    However  the reality seems to be that priority has no effect except for distinguishing DECORATOR from all the other priorities   Unless a job has DECORATOR priority it just seems to get run in the sequence in which it was scheduled  and maybe that s only because of a minimum startup delay thSo I m now going to have to do some complicated scheduling when a priority based approach would have been good enough for my purposes Although I don t need a guarantee  something approximately in order would still be really useful  ,3

102395,Project FORCES source files to be CHILD of project folder, It does not make sense to force source files to be UNDER the project folder   Please read this in entirity   Navigator does not see files that are not child of project folder   I explicitly created a project and specified a separate location of the source files  What if you change IDE s but do not want to replicate or move your source or deal with a foreign project file parent folder   To have a  projectfile that is forced to be ABOVE or part of the source is not good   Why can t the  project file be in the project folder BUT the source for the project be located somewhere else   WITHOUT importing      I tried to do this  but after creating a project with source files located somewhere else  your navigator view DOES NOT SHOW THEM   Therefore  you must import the source files into the project folder in order for the navigator to see them       Can you fix this PS    How do you view  core  Java source files in the navigator project view without being redundant   ie the source files have  class analogs in the core library  jar and you want to view the source in the project but the project should be aware not to comile the  core  source files because the  jar core library files should have precedence PPS  How do you simply insert a file into the project  ,3

438156, CDO  Reference to external element in native stored as a CDOIDExternal, Patch adding a cache for CDOIDExternal elementsHello We are experiencing a drawback in performance from legacy mode to native mode when a reference to an external element  from the cdo repository  is accessed a significant number of times In Native mode  CDOObjectImpl dynamicGet delegates to the EStore  because the reference is not in the settings array   The CDOStore gets from the revision a CDOIDExternal which is then used in convertToEMF  In a test case with several CDOResource  it takes a significant time to process it In Legacy mode  we directly had the referenced element as an attribute of the implementation class  I will add a JUnit to this bugzilla thI do not think th I have a patch which adds a cache for the CDOIDExternal in the CDOStore  Do you think it is a good way to improve the performance Regards Steve ,3

508284,FreeEdit behavior in ComboBoxCellEditor deviates from TextCellEditor,   The free edit mode works now  thank you for the fix  However we now have a minor issue with the behavior of the free edit mode With the free edit mode enabled our users expect the same behavior than with a plain TextCellEditor  This means when the cell is selected and the user starts typing the previous cell value is replaced with the keys pressed  In our setup however  the cell configured with the ComboBoxCellEditor  with free edit mode enabled  switches into edit mode and the cell value is always set to the first entry of the given canonicalValues array  The first key press seems to be discarded and every consecutive key is appended in front of the existing text Is there something we might have overlooked  We are basically using the default ComboBoxCellEditor and passing a fixed list of canonicalValues  of type string   Afterwards we call setFreeEdit true   Thanks again for your fast and capable support  it is very much appreciated  ,3

441264, IDE  New WIKI page with Eclipse feature proposals and the WIKI link attached to the N amp N page of the milestone, The main goal of the solution is to promote the development of the release  When someone during the milestone comes up with the idea about some new  interesting feature for Eclipse then they can provide proper entry to the proposed WIKI  The N amp N however can have some  new feature proposal available  icon and proper link to the WIKI  The feature has to be provided in the installable form from the external site  i e  Eclipse Market or Git Hub  When feature is stable enough and accepted by the users it can be merged to the master Git repository      Additionally the WIKI page and indirectly the N amp N one can contain the link to the Bugzilla or blog where the new feature get deeply discussed  When we agree to go with it we have to figure out the way of filtering the craps th However I think  we can postpone it till a first crap What can we achieve by this solution   incoming release can be earlier announced by the blog entries dedicated to the new features and it can encourage the new people from the Community for helping with the development of the new release as well as the users for switching to Eclipse as the primary IDE or RCP platform  new interesting architectural design changes can be proposed with the features  It will be real prove of concept and not only  raw  idea sent via e mail  some really strong Eclipse developers consultants can find the idea interesting and help with development of the new release  during implementation of the new feature you have to quite often fix some defects that block the feature or get exposed by it  what indirectly improves the quality of Eclipse  current solution   announcing the new ideas by mailing list   is not sufficient in my opinion  Some ideas finish with several discussion e mails  Even when something get implemented it can be forgotten in the moment  Having the persisted list with the feature proposals on WIKI that is connected to N amp N page  better visible than the mailing list archive  seems to be better solution in my opinionPlease let me know what do you think about the proposal Daniel ,3

368882,No more authentication window when using URLConnection in Eclipse Plugin, Build Identifier  Version  Indigo Release Build id  20110615 0604I have a strange behavior in Eclipse with differnt plugins like BIRT  When a plugin is using a URLConnection to a server with a secured URL  in the past Eclipse automatically shows up a login dialog to perform Basic Authentication with the server This seems to be a feature from Eclipse platform implemented through the extension point org eclipse equinox security loginModule  I know about this behavior  because I have implemented my own plugin with a custom login dialog  And if the user give me wrong user password then the eclipse login dialog pops up automatically  So from the view of a plugin it is sufficient to provide a code like this Code      urlConnection    HttpURLConnection  new URL myURL  openConnection   urlConnection setRequestMethod  GET   urlConnection setDoOutput true  urlConnection setDoInput true  urlConnection setAllowUserInteraction false  urlConnection connect        No special handling was necessary  If the URL returns an 401  then the eclipse login dialog appears automatically You can test this behavior also in the BIRT Plugin when creating a DataSet based on a XML URL  BIRT has no implementation for username password for XML URLs But for some strange reasons this dialog did not longer appear in some clients after the EGit Plugin was installed  After I have reverted a Eclipse IDE into a setup without the Egit Plugin the internal login dialog appears again Can anybody check if EGit makes use of the extension point  org eclipse equinox security loginModule  Tested with     Eclipse EGit1 1 0 201109151100 rReproducible  AlwaysSteps to Reproduce 1 start Eclipse without EGit Plugin2 create BIRT Report with a XML DataSet based on a URL from a secured server resource 3 Log into the server by giving userid password into the standard login dialog4 Install EGit Plugin5 create BIRT Report with a XML DataSet based on a URL from a secured server resource   No Login dialog will apear ok   mybe this is a little bit cumbersome So you can test it with a debug code where you setup an URL Connection to a secured resource urlConnection    HttpURLConnection  new URL        openConnection   urlConnection setRequestMethod  GET   urlConnection setDoOutput true  urlConnection setDoInput true  urlConnection setAllowUserInteraction false  urlConnection connect    ,3
