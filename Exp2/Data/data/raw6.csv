load each other during their start handling If one thread is using an class type from the cdt core plugin while another one is using a type from the cdt managedbuilder core  then the 2 threads end up in a dependency loop  equinox detects this for each class loaded and breaks the loop after 5 seconds In the end I see thI actually do not see this when starting up eclipse normally  only when using our test runner The CCorePlugin start behavior loading the managed builder was introduced with  in order to address a delay loading problem The ManagedBuilderCorePlugin class just needs stuff

org eclipse cdt internal core dom parser cpp semantics CPPInheritance FinalOverriderMap mergeOverriders CPPInheritance java 107  Where when it gets stuck seems to be rather random  and after restart re index  it doesn t seem to hit the problem on the same file second time around Full call stack for other threads is attached Since the indexer is effectively dead after this  there is no choice but to restart eclipse  which leads to another lengthy re indexing on startup  Subjectively  it seems worse  ie  occurs more frequently  in the current release Eclipse has plenty of memory  and settings in eclipse ini allow for 16Gb of memory heap  in machine with 32Gb  The  cproject for this is cmake generated  but we post process to exclude things like boost repo  which cause slow parsing  amp  memory exhaustion Even if the underlying cause of hangs here can not be identified  it would be nice if could just  give up  if it gets stuck If I periodically sample the thread s call stack  it seems to be calling methods below mergeOverriders    but never returning from mergeOverriders      The indexer progress bar in the GUI reports the name of a file it has hung on  which in this cases was a

469961,Traditional Memory Rendering should allow to narrow scrollable area for an easier positioning using scrollbar slider, Traditional Memory Rendering defines the scroll range to cover the whole addressable memory range which for a standard 32bit architecture would mean with a single mouse drag to move memory view to display any of 2 147 483 647 lines of scroll With this amount of total lines to scroll  scrollbar slider is not quite usable for positioning memory view to desired location  or even close to it   as any minor mouse movement will move the visible address by tenths of megabytes  I propose to address this in a similar way as platform hex rendering does for dynamic loading mode  i e  an workspace preference to specify number of lines for scrolling  IMHO  a default  100 lines is quite reasonable  Once user scrolls close to top bottom the scroll area will be re positioned  ,3

355229,Allow one quick fix to be reported with several variants, A single Quick Fix class should be able to report more than one Quick Fix  each with different labels Example For the  invalid arguments  C   problem  the description contains the list of candidate overloads  It makes sense for a single quick fix which would report as many variants as there are candidate overloads  Each variant should have its own name Also  change to use reference  and  change to use const reference   and similar cases where two or more fixes are very similar  could be easily introduced as only one class  not two About the implementation  this looks a bit non trivial since each Quick Fix class is now a subclass of IMarkerResolution  This could use a redesign The point is th Compare the interfaces for the obvious difference org eclipse ui IMarkerResolutionorg eclipse cdt ui text IQuickFixProcessorI think JDT uses the latter for code analysis  I m not sure though  This may be the way to go  and I somehow expect this approach to be related to  ,3
