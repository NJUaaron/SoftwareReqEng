427346,Provide a dynamic description for the delete button context menu, Hi all I wrote an XXXDeleteFeature and I would like to provide a dynamic description for the delete button   context menu option depending on the business object state of the selected picture element This way  I would have the possibility to give the user an explanation when deletion is not allowed  typically in case of a  LOCK  state     I tried to dynamically process a description while executing  canDelete   so thBut  getDescription   is executed before  canDelete   And get access to my business object  to check its state  in  getDesciption would be tricky because the method doesn t have any IDeleteContext parameter like in  canDelete See related topic for a few more details  Kind regards Laurent ,3
