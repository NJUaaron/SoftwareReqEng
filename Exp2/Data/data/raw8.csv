469492,EMFModelProvider is caching too eagerly, When calculating a logical model for a resource the EMFModelProvider caches the calculated model not only for the resource itself but for all resources which are affected by the logical model This is done under the assumption thResolution Setting  Workspace  Here the assumption holds  The calculated logical model is the same for each resource Resolution Setting  Outgoing  Here the assumption does not hold  The calculated logical model is actually different for each resource  Consider modelA   gt  modelB   gt  modelC The logical models are    modelA  modelB  modelC  for modelA   modelB  modelC  for modelB   modelC  for modelCBecause of the caching mechanism the EMFModelProvider returns different logical models depending on the order they are calculated  For example  it may return  modelA  modelB  modelC  for all resources if the logical model of modelA was asked for first  It may also return all three different types of logical models if modelC is asked for first Resolution Setting  Container  Here the assumption does not hold  The calculated logical model may be different for some resources  Consider modelA   gt  dir modelB  dir modelB   gt  dir modelC The logical models are    modelA  modelB  modelC  for modelA   modelB  modelC  for modelB and modelCDepending on the calculated order  the EMFModelProvider may return both of the calculated models for modelB and modelC  or one each  Resolution Setting  Project  Here the assumption does not hold  I did not try it  but since nested projects are actually supported now  you should be able to construct the same scenario as for the container setting  ,3

316139,NPE when using a qualified Id for the ConstraintProviders extension, modified org eclipse emf validation examples general to reproduce the problemIf you specify a qualified Id in the definition of a ConstraintProvider extension  there is a NullPointerException in JavaConstraintParser After digging a little with the debugger I pinpointed the problem to method JavaConstraintParser parseConstraint   which uses IExtension getNamespaceIdentifier   of the declaring extension as the Id of the bundle  used to load the AbstractModelConstraint class  In the case of a qualified Ids  the namespace identifier is different than the bundle Id The workaround is simple  change the ID to use the plugin Id as name space  or use simple  non qualified  Ids in the ConstraintProviders definition However  it seems to me th I think you should instead use IConfigurationElement getContributor to get the bundleID  see the following quote from the documentation of the deprecated method IConfigurationElement getNamespace lt quote gt As namespace is no longer restricted to the contributor name  use   link  getNamespaceIdentifier    to obtain namespace name or   link  getContributor    to get the name of the contributor of this registry element In the past namespace was dictated by the name of the bundle  If bundle  lt code gt org abc lt  code gt  contributed registry element with Id of  lt code gt MyId lt  code gt   the namespace of the element was always set to  lt code gt org abc lt  code gt   producing the qualified name of  lt code gt org abc MyId lt  code gt  The namespace used to be the same as the bundle name  As a result  the   link  getNamespace    method was used both to obtain the name of the bundle and to obtain the namespace of a registry element Since 3 2  the extension registry allows elements to specify qualified name  The extension point of the plug in  lt code gt org abc lt  code gt  could specify  lt code gt org zzz MyExtPoint lt  code gt  as an Id  In this case  namespace name is  lt code gt org zzz lt  code gt   but the contributor name is  lt code gt org abc lt  code gt   The use of a simple Id is still a preferred way  Whenever possible  specify only the simple Id and let runtime take care of the rest  If your code used the   link  getNamespace    to obtain the name of the contributing bundle  use   link  getContributor     The typical usage pattern here is to find a bundle name to obtain some information from the corresponding OSGi bundle  For example  deducing the file locationspecified as a relative path to the bundle install location would fall into this group If your code used the   link  getNamespace    to obtain the namespace of the registry element  use   link  getNamespaceIdentifier     Typically  this is the case when code is trying to process registry elements belonging to some logical group  For example  processing notifications for all elements belonging to the  lt code gt org abc lt  code gt  namespace would fall into this category  lt  quote gt  The same assumption regarding the bundleId is done at several other places in the framework  particularly in class XmlConstraintDescriptorI attach a modified version of org eclipse emf validation examples general to reproduce the problem  All the modifications are in the plugin xml file  The important modification is specifying a qualified Id for the ConstraintProviders extension defintion  There is a another subtle difference in the file plugin xml w r t the original  the header of the file specifies an eclipse version greater than 3 2  lt  eclipse version  3 4   gt   Otherwise  the platform considers thI have tested in Galileo EMF 2 5 Validation 1 3 and also in Helios EMF 2 6 Validation 1 4  an although the NPE happens in different places the error is present  ,3

291632,Proposal  Eclipse downloadable plugins file format, Develop a new file formIntro  the current plugin installation methods are incomplete   Using the update manager is OK  but users like downloading software  Most people who encounter an interesting plugin will not install it right away  if they won t download it  they will forget about it   The Dropins folder is too tech savvy  We want Eclipse to appeal to a broad range of users  Besides  the installtion using the Dropins has very limited options and if it fails there s no way for the developer to assist in solving the issue  like in a full installer  To solve that  A new Eclipse downloadable file formThe form There are several options as for the contents of this JAR   A URL of an update site  The URL could be in the manifest or in a dedicated resource bundle file  Upon launching the file  Eclipse will automatically add the site and start an installation process  One may think of more advanced options to include other than the URL  e g  the feature name to install  which will transparently select the feature and move on the installation phase   An archived update site  Operates much like the remote installation  but uses the local archive  It would be nice to add an option to check for newer versions One may take this one step further and allow the file to contain a complete OSGi bundle  Upon launching the file  the platform will automatically install the bundle and start it  enabling developers to develop custom installers and plugins which will not require any installation  for example  you want to do something just once  The platform should protect against malicious content  check for code signing and confirm with the user before executing the code  much like it is done today with downloaded content in Windows and OS X Future plugin updates will use the current Eclipse update mechanism  although it could be possible to download a newer version of the plugin and install it in the same easy manner More details in the blog post   ,3

508853,The method CDOUtil setCredentialsProvider seems incoherent with CDONet4jViewProvider credentials handling, was suggested in  to use CDOUtil setCredentialsProvider URI  IPasswordCredentialsProvider  to avoid having credentials in URI so CDONet4jViewProvider getNet4jSessionConfiguration can retrieve the credentials without passing those in the URI The problem is thIndeed  in the method CDONet4jViewProvider getNet4jSessionConfiguration we have the following code  StringBuilder builder   new StringBuilder   append builder  connector  repositoryName  String resource   builder toString    private void append StringBuilder builder  IConnector connector  String repositoryName        String authority   getURIAuthority connector      builder append authority      builder append          builder append repositoryName     We can see thOr in CDOUtil  we have the following code   CDOURIData data   new CDOURIData uri      data setUserName null      data setPassWord null      data setResourcePath null      data setBranchPath null      data setTimeStamp CDOBranchPoint UNSPECIFIED DATE      data setTransactional false      String resource   data toString   with    Override  public String toString         StringBuilder builder   new StringBuilder       builder append scheme      builder append            if  userName    null    So we will register a credential provider like net4j    localhost 2036 repoin CDOUtil and matche again localhost 2036 repo in CDONet4jViewProviderOf course I could set a credentials provider for the proper resource without using CDOUtil setCredentialsProvider but I think it would be cleaner to use it So I would like to do a patch adding a method org eclipse emf cdo net4j CDONet4jViewProvider getNet4jSession IConnector  CDOURIData  that will retrieve the credential provider with the code   credentialsProvider    IPasswordCredentialsProvider getContainer   getElement CredentialsProviderFactory PRODUCT GROUP   password   uriData toString    and using it in org eclipse emf cdo net4j CDONet4jViewProvider getView URI  ResourceSet  CDONet4jViewProvider getNet4jSession is the only place in CDO using the group CredentialsProviderFactory PRODUCT GROUP and type  password  with the  CDOUtil setCredentialsProvider method so I think they should be coherent Does it makes sense or am I missing something  ,3

282542,Stronger support for the bundle pooling,  I was recently discussing with a friend of mine the problem of multiple eclipse installations could be solved by using bundle pooling and custom dynamic bootstrapping of eclipse with appropriate profile With bundle pooling one could have the entire world of eclipse plug ins in a single bundle pool but only bootstrap with those enabled thIf done right  the launcher could for example in addition to selecting your workspace ask you to choose your  eclipse profile   and possibly remember to bind the profile to the workspace  This way we would not need to install multiple instances of Eclipse and still gain the benefits of having separate IDE configurations for  Java  vs  J2EE  vs  Modeling  development   As a possible user of this feature I envision th The prompt should allow us to create a brand new profile or use the default one  based on the downloaded package   or allow selecting from a set of preconfigured profiles The way I see this  the  default  bundle pool would be hosted If this idea has any merit  I am more than happy to elaborate more on the possible use cases and usage scenarios  ,3

259569,No  easy  way to call OSGi plug in APIs from outside OSGi, My company produces software development tools  such as static analysis tools  Often  those tools are invoked from the command line or from an Eclipse GUI  But sometimes  they must be invoked by direct Java calls from existing java systems  build systems  web servers etc   Those existing systems are hundreds of times larger than our simple tools so we can t impose requirements on how they work We would like some of our tools to use OSGi internally  OSGi s a greSo  how can I expose my plug in APIs to the outside world   Remember  these APIs use OSGi internally to load plug ins  Options   Allow client to instantiate my API classes directly by using the JARs  Problem  their defining class loader will not be an OSGi bundle class loader  which means loading plug ins won t work because Platform getExtensionRegistry doesn t work unless you re loaded by such a class loader   Persuade my customers to structure part of their code as an IApplication  and run th  Add a mechanism to EclipseStarter  or similar classes  to ask for an IExtensionRegistry  or similar   This could be called from inside or outside Eclipse  meaning our clients could instantiate our APIs using their own class loaders  Yet those APIs will still be able to load other plug ins   Add an API where the client to these APIs can declare itself a user of some given plugin or package within OSGi  They then get their class loader fiddled with  such thThe closest I can come is a class which will run a  Runnable  with access to OSGi plug in APIs as described Example customer code might look like this                                                 package com macrobug testOutside import com macrobug osgiWrapper OsgiWrapper import com macrobug testinside

some mechanism which fulfils the same need  But before that  here s a load of questions for anyone reading this bug 1  Is there some completely different way to achieve the same objectives 2  For example  if my client instantiates my APIs directly  using their own class loader  I d like to use Platform getExtensionRegistry  or similar  to load OSGi plug ins  Even though I m not a plug in  since I ve been loaded using normal class loader schemes  This seems logically sensible   it allows OSGi to be used for parts of systems without the whole thing being modularised  Is there a way to do this 3  If I m forced to stick with the above hacks  are there better ways to achieve parts of it 4  For example  is there a way retrospectively to change the class loader which will be used by a Java class to load other classes  Then we could simply retro fit the hybrid class loader to a class without having to mess about force instantiating a Runnable   The loading of the Runnable is hugely fragile  and in itself imposes restrictions upon the way the outside code is structured  5  If not  is there some way I can ask the current ClassLoader to instantiate the Runnable  but ensure that the JVM marks me as definining it 6  Is there a nicer way to squeeze an OSGi classloader out of OSGi  without having to fake a plug in 7  The main purpose of this bug  could some sort of  less horrible  mechanism to fulfil the same purpose be added to OSGi Equinox Eclipse  Or  better still  could an equivalent of Platform getExtensionRegistry be added so it can be called outside of OSGi  ,3
