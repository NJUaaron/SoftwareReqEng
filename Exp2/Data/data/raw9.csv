518724,ProxyServlet DispatchTargets silently adds trailing slash to requests to ContextRoot without trailing slash, We re running Equinox in a Servlet Container using the servlet bridge  The application has a Vaadin Web UI  Vaadin checks the request URI  if it leads to    lt context root gt   without trailing slash  it redirects to    lt context root gt     thus avoiding problems with a wrong request URI down the line Recently  we updated to Neon  updating org eclipse equinox http servlet from 1 2 1 to 1 3 1  This changed the way the request is proxied In 1 2 1  HttpServletRequestBuilderWrapperImpl did not override getRequestURU   and just returned the requestUri of the wrapped request In 1 3 1  instead the HttpServletRequestWrapperImpl is used  which returns DispatchTargets getRequestURI    This uses the path info of the incoming request  If the path info is null      is used  which changes to the proxied request to    lt context root gt   to    lt context root gt     Vaadin will no longer redirect  and the UI subsequently does not work  because the actual request URI is still    lt context root gt   Our expectation is the following in the case that the path info is null   The DispatchTargets are resolved as if the path info were      as before   The request uri stays the same as in the incoming request ,3

128091,need programmatic enhancement for plugin provided JSF libraries, I would like to see a programmatic way of participating in adding JSF implementations to a project   The current approach of subclassing JSFLibraryArchiveFilesDelegate is sound but there are a number of scenarios which it will not cover adequately   Ideally adding some sort of  optional   post copy  IRunnable operation will let an implementation provider make further necessary modifications to a project s configuration   Examples where such functoinality is needed  Resources other than just WEB INF lib jarfiles may need to be copied into a project  for example   css files  Different IRuntime targets on a project may result in different files being copied into the project   For example  one version of a test server may already include some JSF implementation dependencies such as Apache Commons or JSTL hars while a different server may not    Some servers will already include an entire JSF implementation as well   Some projects will not use the default Faces Servlet configuration  which is not controllable by the delegate    For example  on a portal server this servlet would not get defined but a Faces Portlet would need to be declared instead    Some JSF implementation want require additional context parameters defined in web xml I think the existing delegate structure is sufficient for basic cases but an addition to the extension point th ,3

126937,Provide a workspace modifying command that can batch resource change deltas,  Min wrote  It would be nice to be able to have some ability to wrap the execute   method th I want to extend compose   so thatall the commands will execute within a IWorspaceRunnable which will allow me tobatch resource change delta  Linda wrote  I m not sure that I understand your request to make execute   compatiblewith compose     Regarding your requiremenet to batch resource change deltasthat occur in a command  I propose providing a workspace modifying commandthICommands are self composing so only one workspace wrapper implementation isrequired for both composites and non composites  When you know that yourcommand may modify the workspace  you can instantiate this workspace modifyingcommand to wrap the real command Min wrote Ignore wh     The workspace wrapperICommand makes sense to me  I presume that when you compose   the workspacewrapper ICommand  the resulting ICommand will also be a workspace wrapperICommand  One wrinkle  It would be nice to be able to specify a IScheduling in the baseICommand  That way if you have many ICommands that are composed with eachother  the top most ICommand can create a MultiRule that composes all of thespecified scheduling rules together  For example  you have ICommands  ACmd and BCmd  A will modifyproject1 dir1 file1 txt and B will modify project2 dir1 file2 txt  You set theproper scheduling rules on each Command  IFile is a ISchedulingRule   If you doACmd compose BCmd  you should have a command that will execute within the ruleMultiRule combine   of file1 txt and file2 txt  Acquiring this combined scheduling rule is known as fine grained workspacelocking  It will only lock the workspace for the specified two resources andwill allow other concurrent resource modifications done to all other resourcesto proceed normally  See Linda wrote Sounds like a good idea   The workspace command wrapper can get all of theaffected files from the ICommand that it wraps  composites return the list ofaffected files from all of their children    It can then schedule a workspacejob to execute the delegate command with the MultiRule that combines all of thefiles  ,3

167318,Better support for subclassing of XXXMarkerNavigationProvider, I wanted to extend the existing XXXMarkerNavigationProvider classes  AbstractDiagram and Diagram   to support using the elementId  as opposed to viewId  as the id in a marker  problem marker   However  many important methods of  AbstractDiagramMarkerNavigationProvider and DiagramMarkerNavigationProvider are impossible  marked private or final  or impractical  do not expose useful functionality  to override  To fix this  I ve implemented replacements  For DiagramMarkerNavigationProvider the only fix is making selectInDiagram protected  For AbstractDiagramMarkerNavigationProvider the main fix is extracting the body of the loop in recursiveConvertIdToView as an overridable method  so subclassers can add other strategies for matching a view with an id  My subclass was reduced to overriding this method with    override to also check the view element s id    protected View getViewForId View view  String viewId   EObject element   view getElement   if  element    null  amp  amp  viewId equals   XMLResource element eResource    getID element     return view  return super getViewForId view  viewId        ,3

313665,Some Layout Algorithms Can Place Nodes Outside of Screen Bounds, Noticed when using TreeLayoutAlgorithm and RadialLayoutAlgorithm This bug is reproducable using the example applications includes in the  Simple Swing Example included with the Zest source org eclipse zest layouts exampleUses SimpleSwingExample java1  Run the application 2  Click  Radial  3  Note that the nodes at the bottom of the graph are drawn closer to the   containers edge than those  The graph is off centre on the Y    axis  Also note thGraphs appear shifted down the Y axis  In some cases this shift can cause nodes to be drawn outside of the bounds given to the layout algortihm The same shift can be seen when using the TreeLayoutAlgorithm  It is not seen using FlowLayout or GridLayout I have traced this problem back to the function AbstractLayoutAlgorithm adjustNodeSizeAndPos      where removing the call in the else    block to node setInternalLocation   appears to solve the problem Unfortunately I don t know the context behind the logic used in this function so I can t say for sure whether my fix is the best solution  but it seems to work for the cases I have tested so far If this is the correct fix I believe the code is also broken for the X axis in cases where widthToHeightRatio is  lt  1 0  A similar fix should be applied there  ,3
