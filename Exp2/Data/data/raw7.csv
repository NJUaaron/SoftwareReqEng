461622,Cleanup ReqIF identifier handling, The references of ReqIF are based on IDs which are stored in the XML IDENTIFIER attribute   The initial implementation in RMF stored the object IDs as part of the model  intrinsic IDs   It was possible to modify the ID by means of the model API getIdentifier     setIdentifier    Keeping an ID thTo overcome this issue  EMF provides the concept of extrinsic IDs  IDs are no longer stored as part of the model  They are stored in a map thIn release 0 11 0 RMF switched from the concept of intrinsic IDs  IDs in the model  to extrinsic IDs  IDs in a separate map  and fixed several issues with respect to duplicate IDs  The basic functionality is available but some cleanup is still required   the model API setIdentifier     getIdentifier   is still available  Unfortunately  the identifier in the model is not kept in sync with the  official  identifier in the extrinsic EObject2IDMap  E g  setIdentifier   on a new SpecObject will write the Id into the model  But the serialization into XML will only look into the extrinsic EObject2IdMap and will create a new ID if the object is not yet available   The handling of IDs might work nicely for ReqIF objects  However  the tool extensions might want to reference objects by standard EMF paths because the target doesn t have an ID   The proxy resolution mechanism doesn t scale well  If an object cannot be found by its  extrinsic  ID  then the algorithm tries to find the target by its intrinsic ID  which requires to check the IDs of all elements in the resource   ,3

457072,Eclipse  Java  IDE website should maintain a feature overview page, Started as discussion during the AC meeting  this bug is created to track complains and proposals how to make the Eclipse website more helpful and attractive to users  Some first thoughts When users compare IDEs with each other  they are looking for a feature overview  Several IDEs feature such overview pages  1 2 3  but Eclipse does not provide a convenient website for this  To some extent the help center addresses parts of this content but doesn t seem to be actively maintained anymore One example  with every milestone release a list of new and noteworthy features are added but the help center does not reflect these changes  If people want to learn how to use Eclipse  they have to assemble their knowledge by reading dozens of blog posts from many different websites Project pages like JDT  4  look abandoned  What s happening mentions 3 7 as latest item   the EMF download page  5  features THE BLEEDING EDGE from 8th April 2009 In a first step   core  platform projects should update their website content  provide feature overviews  and generally provide recent and helpful content  Maybe the EF could offer tour pages for the Java IDE s   PHP etc  on their main page More thoughts  1   2   3   4   5   ,3

367630,Enhancement  Identity Override for optional auto generator strategy in derived concrete entities, Build Identifier  2 3 The context here is how to align JPA capabilities to Java generics  and allow to write clean java codes  Considering JPA coding  I have some preferences      Field mapping over method mapping    Try to use all power of java generics in java model design     Factor and reduce code in generic mapped super classes  for maintenance and safety reasons  All those advantages are lost because of a missing JPA function   Identity generation override capability Lets show it in a simple reduced exampleBaseEntity lt K gt    a generic mapped super class  with a prim key of type K  LongBasedEntity   a concrete derived entity class mapped on  LONG ENTITY  table with  BIGINT  prim key type StringBasedEntity   a concrete derived entity class mapped on  STRING ENTITY  table with  VARCHAR 32   prim key typeSeqBasedEntity   a concrete derived entity class mapped on  SEQ ENTITY  table with  BIGINT  prim key type  But with auto generate sequence values in this case  Sequence Table Auto generator       I want the abstract BaseEntity class to host all common fields and methods    And I want specially to declare the id variable in thFor LongBasedEntity and StringBasedEntity  I can use  AttributeOverride and  AssociationOveride to achieve the mapping to related tables  But for SeqBasedEntity  there is actually no way to override the generation strategy     Because there is noannotation for that  So  I am proposing to add a new annotation    IdOverride generate GeneratedValue      This make sense  because JPA already allow mapping override at the entity class level      So  if you have defined the id in higher level classes  you can just specify generate parameter An example follow  MappedSuperclass public abstract class BaseEntity lt K extends Serializable gt  implements Serializable   private static final long serialVersionUID   1L    Version  Column name    VERSION   protected Integer version    Id  Basic optional   false   Column name    ID   nullable   false  protected K id   protected BaseEntity     super       protected BaseEntity K xid    this id   xid     public K getId     return id     public void setId K xid    this id   xid     Entity  Table name    LONG ENTITY  public abstract class LongBasedEntity extends BaseEntity lt Long gt    private static final long serialVersionUID   1L    Basic optional   false   Column name    ENT TYPE   length   32  private String entType   protected LongBasedEntity     super       protected LongBasedEntity Long id    super id      public String getEntityType     return entType     public void setEntityType String s    this entType   s     Entity  Table name    STRING ENTITY  public abstract class StringBasedEntity extends ManagedEntity lt String gt    private static final long serialVersionUID   1L    Basic optional   false   Column name    ENT TYPE   length   32  private String entType   protected StringBasedEntity     super       protected StringBasedEntity String id    super id      public String getEntityType     return entType     public void setEntityType String s    this entType   s     Entity  Table name    SEQ ENTITY   TableGenerator name  METAINFO GEN   table  SEQUENCE TABLE   pkColumnName  SEQ NAME   valueColumnName  SEQ COUNT   pkColumnValue  METAINFO    IdOverride generate  GeneratedValue strategy GenerationType TABLE  generator  METAINFO GEN   public abstract class SeqBasedEntity extends BaseEntity lt Long gt    private static final long serialVersionUID   1L    Basic optional   false   Column name    ENT TYPE   length   32  private String entType   protected SeqBasedEntity     super       protected SeqBasedEntity Long id    super id      public String getEntityType     return entType     public void setEntityType String s    this entType   s    By using  IdOverride  I can now separate the key generation strategy and the inheritance and data type problems I also thought to use  AttributeOverride with an optional generate parameter    But this will certainly add overhead in existing implementation error tracking  There are many others valuable reasons to add this functionality     But as coding preferences are different from developers  I prefer to let others give their thoughts for this request for enhancement Thanks for taking this problem very seriously because I have tone of codes waiting for refactoring Regards Reproducible  Always ,3

485400,Provide an API to get an attribute value for a given entity instance, I don t know if this is the right place for such a request  but since EclipseLink is the JPA Reference Implementation I hope It would be VERY helpful if the JPA metamodel supported a way to get an attribute value given the javax persistence metamodel Attribute lt X  Y gt  instance and an actual instance of the entity th Something like Y getValue X entityInstance  In case of the canonical metamodel  the implementation might even be generated  since X type is known   otherwise a generic reflection based implementation might be provided by the JPA implementation Right now  I have to provide this by myself  A proof of concept for the SingularAttribute case private static  lt E  A gt  A getAttributeValue final E entity final SingularAttribute lt   super E  A gt  attribute     try      final Member member   attribute getJavaMember       if  member instanceof Method          SuppressWarnings  unchecked        final A result    A    Method  member  invoke entity        return result       else if  member instanceof Field          SuppressWarnings  unchecked        final A result    A    Field  member  get entity        else        throw new IllegalArgumentException            unexpected Java member type  expecting Method or Field  found               member      catch  final Exception e        throw new RuntimeException e      There are two problems though   in case of Field  an access through the getter  instead of a direct access through the field itself  would respect object encapsulation an hence would be preferable  it s not a big problem to enhance the above code to try getter access before direct field access in the  member instanceof Field  case  though   this is much harder  instead  I m experiencing that for related entities the member is a Method but in case of statically weaved classes this Method is not my declared method  but rather an internal EclipseLink Weaver generated method that does not return the actual value  but rather a ValueHolder for thatThis is a problem because I would need to unwrap the value holder and I couldn t yet find a proper way to do thSo  if the JPA API provided such a feature  it would be very helpful when using the metamodel to perform generic processing over entities Meanwhile  any suggestion to solve the  ValueHolder  problem would be appreciated  ,3

528797,Coordinate when  amp  how artifacts are published to Maven Central, I suggest to coordinate the process of publishing to Maven Central in similar ways as the Simultaneous Release already does for publishing eclipse packages and p2 repositories This is not to start yet another discussion about which technology should be used  agreeing on one technology could be a second step  once   if we agree on the need for coordination and the desired process                                                                            Claim  Eclipse artifacts are more and more widely consumed in Maven builds                                                                          Typically  as also some expressed in today s meeting   Eclipse developers tend to think thI m  however  observing some motion thE g   the Nov 2017 minutes of the AC  1  mention which also entailed some disussion on the mailing list There was a lot of interest when we worked on publishing all artifacts of Platform  JDT and PDE to Maven Central  see  2  and linked bugs  A lot of EMF  and Xtext based software is consumed in plain maven builds I m sure there are more examples                                                                           With widespread adoption comes the need for coordination                                                                          If this a trend thFirstly  dependencies between Eclipse projects  In MANIFEST MF  we simply express dependencies using BSN and a version range  hopefully adhering to semantic versioning   It is not trivial how to translate those dependencies to Maven  and if you don t own the other project  it may be impossible to guess   even the simple G A V coordinates involve significant uncertainty     what s the groupId  see    do projects know about it      should 4 part versions be kept  which delimiter     how to identify release versions  should we publish snaptshots     are version ranges a viable option in Maven land     if so  should we help users in creating reproducible builds with exact    version dependencies  of all transitive dependencies      are parent poms used  which and how   are orbit dependencies reliably translated back to their  original  G A V   Nothing worse than different projects pulling in the same 3rd party lib  using different IDs  Secondly  even if a project knows the coordinates of another project it depends on  can it rely on a release schedule for required artifacts appearing on Maven Central at a specific point in time Thirdly  even disregarding dependencies between projects  creating proper Maven metadata involves a few choices  where guidance for projects joining the train would be useful  Aspects include  linking to git repo  listing developers and also  how to translate OSGi Fragments and their dependencies to Maven I hold th                                                                          Some possible solutions                                                                          A full solution could be established by adding an opt in flag to SimRel  whereby projects express whether or not they participate in coordinated publishing to Maven Central  For those thOnce a project opts in  it will have to provide a few more details  minimally the groupId and basic metadata of the project At an intermediate level  instead of full integration with SimRel a working group of release engineers of participating projects could  manually  coordinate their dependencies and schedules Minimally  all projects thI could also think of making this a standard entry in the PMI s release records Obviously  the full solution would require to invest a bit of effort up front but personally I m convinced that this will pay off quickly  and once the process has become routine it will create huge benefits for consumers   once more demonstrating that Eclipse releases can be relied upon    1   2   ,3

459111, CacheIndex updateable and  Column updatable provide redundant information,  CacheIndex can be annotated on entities and their fields accessors  therefore I agree thRequiring the configuration or annotation of redundant information is bad practice because it is prone to contradictions  like  CacheIndex updateable true but  Column updatable false  Therefore  I believe the default should be changed in case  CacheIndex is annotated on a field accessor  and an  Column annotation is present as well on said field accessor  under these circumstances   CacheIndex updatable should default to  Column updatable  which itself defaults to true  ,3

477741,Formatting while typing does not place content inside of braces upon return, Consider this snippet of JS code function foo      doit    If I need to call doit conditionally I can start writing the condition in front of it function foo      if  somecondition     doit    With the vertical bar representing the cursor when I press return at this point I would expect to get this result function foo      if  somecondition         doit       Instead I get this  vertical bar indicating the position of the cursor  function foo      if  somecondition            doit    This is quite annoying since one has the cursor in a place thI m used to the behavior described as  expected  from Eclipse JDT which place content following cursor up to the end of the line inside the braces but keep content on the next line after the closing brace  I think this is more logical and makes it easier to move around code after generating the braces as all existing code is on its own line so moving it up down is quite easy  ,3
