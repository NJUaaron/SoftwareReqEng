102726,Using text size to make code more readable, Statically typed languages  such as Java  force one to have a lot of noise in the code just to keep the compiler happy  When reading the code  variable type declarations  typecasts  method return types  visibilities etc  often make the reading of the code very difficult  This is something I love e g  in Ruby   the code is very readable as there is very little noise So  I came up with an idea  IDE could be of help in reducing the noise  It would be possible to use font sizes to make the code appear so that it is easier to read  The kind of stuff I mentioned above would be in a smaller font  possibly even a different font  Scite editor uses this and having e g  comments in different font enhances the readability incredibly  thus making the reading easier    The solution should be wholly configurable  so the user could select which of the following  and possibly others   are  diminished    method return types  method visibilities  method argument types  types in variable declarations  typecastsetc  It should also be configurable what font size to use for the diminished things  possibly stating size relative to the editor font size  e g   4  I tried it out quickly in Word and I find it very appealing  please see the attached word doc The advantage of this approach is that you can still see the  noisy  elements  but it is easier to ignore them  Also  sometimes you might want to e g  see the visibilities of the methods with no  diminishing   then you could choose to do so  ,5
102987, preferences  Provide UI for overriding the default style sheets used in Javadoc View and tool tip, Currently there are  JavadocViewStyleSheet css  and  JavadocHoverStyleSheet css in the JDT UI plugin which control the appearance of the Javadoc View andtooltip  It is inconvenient to hack the plugin JAR to change these I think the easiest and most flexible way would be to provide fields to specifyuser created stylesheets  The more CSS independent but not such flexible wouldbe to provide separate options like   base font    colors   etc I ve noticed there are some style rules  like  body   font size  x small     applied with higher priority  which don t present in the above mentionedstylesheets  I think such should not be forced over the user stylesheets  Theycould be set as defaults but should not override the user styles  ,5

43603, rulers  QuickDiff provider usability concerns, From another PR Having used the quick diff with  version on disk  and the new  cvs provider  fora little while now   I have some questions and comments 1  Currently  it is very hard to find out that your file has changes withoutscrolling  I didn t find which hot keys to use to  select next previous change  I understand that you want to show line changes but there is no way to findthem  For example  in compare editors the overview ruler shows were the changesare and the select next previous are used to navigate  Maybe we need an editordecoration to hint that it s changed based on the reference document  A hintthat you should look for changes 2  The bar is so narrow th What is the hotkeyfor showing the change  Also what are the hotkeys for replacing the changes 3  Have you thought of providing 3 way diff support  With the CVS quick diffprovider it will be really useful to see the direction of the change tounderstand if you made the change or if it was made remotely         Additional  From Tom Eicher 2003 08 10 17 57        1  I agree   we would need a toggable indication on the overview ruler similarto the one provided by the compare editor  Whether we will want shortcuts ornot  I am not sure   go to previous   next is usually assigned to something elsealready  e g  next problem in Java Editor   so we would have to introduce newshortcuts  2  There are no hotkeys so far   as a workaround for the narrow ruler  if linenumbers are turned on  the ruler gets wider  Instead of using hotkeys forundoing a change  the related actions can be acessed via the ruler s contextmenu  Ctrl W   3  The quick diff indication was really thought as a lightweight changeindication  and I am also considering a shortcutto open the full fledged compareeditor from a change Note th theshortest edit script from reference document to actual  because it is computedincrementally  Try moving around lines for a demonstration of the currentalgorithm s limitations  ,5

298741, RCP  api  Provide the text editor actions for the text viewer, Build Identifier  I20090611 1540I ve got a TextViewer in a ViewPart  note  not  a TextEditor EditorPart  so I can t use the code in AbstractTextEditor to create the actions If I define an action bound to the commands for say cut copy paste delete then they don t work properly  notably delete never works and cut is enabled when read only  because the command falls back on the default widget method I was expecting the TextViewer to register command handlers base on the canDoOperation doOperation methods but no such luck I think this has lead to duplication  there s another TextViewerAction in the console plugin which has seemingly solved this problem by copying the actions   I m faced with a similar prospect as is anyone else who tries to use a TextViewer outside of an AbstractTextEditor Reproducible  AlwaysSteps to Reproduce This is quite simple to reproduce in an RCP app1  Embed a read only TextViewer in a ViewPart 2  Contribute an action bound to the cut command 3  Cut is enabled   Similar recipe with delete and it will be disabled  ,5

418992, preferences  Allow to change general font color without using the  Syntax Coloring  menu, When i use an IDE or editors in general  I usually quick start by darkening the background color and making the general font lighter In eclipse i find this is very unintuitive  There is no such thing as the general font  instead  one has to change color for a myriad of language specific idioms via the  Syntax Coloring  menu While not a blocking point to using eclipse  i think this is really annoying on a new installation  It would be a lot simpler to provide this in the font menu or alongside the coice for background color  ,5
424501, rulers  Text editors  Only show scroll bars when necessary, Currently  Eclipse text editors always show the horizontal and vertical scroll bars  Depending on code style  a horizontal scroll bar may never actually be used  the text is already wrapped after a certain column  Since  in SWT is fixed since 3 8  setAlwaysShowScrollBars false  could be used to make StyledText only show the scroll bars if they are actually necessary This would give the user a bit more precious vertical or horizontal space in some situations and reduces visual clutter  ,5

44156, Commands  parameters  provide M x like command interface, I believe Eclipse usability could be enhanced by providing aninterface similar to Emacs  M x  or Alt x  name of command gesture What I mean It was suggested that I might find the fix to another bug by movingfrom 3 0 M3 to 3 0 M3 I20030930  so I moved  While coding Java  Iwanted to open a class which I knew by name  so I did C S t to get theOpen Type dialog  as I had for many versions  including 3 0 M3  C S tdid nothing  So I went to prefs gt Workbench gt Keys to try to track itdown   Note that this particular task would be easier to accomplish ifone could print the keybindingsbut th  I spent awhile scrolling through thelists but failed to find it  no doubt I did not choose the appropriatecategory In Emacs  one can invoke a command directly  M x name of command   aswell as by keybinding  This is useful  because often the name of thecommand  which can be tab completed in the minibuffer  is moremnemonic than the keybinding Why not provide similar functionality in Eclipse  M x could bring up asimple text dialog into which the user could enter a command  Thenames of the command could be the same as those currently exposed inthe Workbench gt Keys preference page This would also be a useful interface for user defined commands     ,5

56119, Perspectives  Auto hide on all perspective windows , Hi I am a newbie who has currently started working on eclipse IDE   I was earlier working in VS NET Studio One differance in these 2 tools is that VS has an auto hide  pin  button for its various perspective windows which gets activated when mouse is over it and hides or docks when the mouse has exited  I have not found it in eclipse IDE  This is a very imp  functionality as far as programmers are concerned coz no one likes cluttered workspace where the we have to scroll   scroll   and scroll to see the code written or close the windows and restart them I would be happy  i know thats one of your goals   to make the java programmer happy  if i can get the same functionality here in Eclipse IDE where in the perspective windows get maximized when a pointer is over them and minimized when i dont need them   that would be just great if you alreary have it  plz let me know   Waiting or your reply     Cheers and regards Amey Joshi  ,5
56423, MPE  MultiPageSelectionProvider should take the editor into acount, MultiPageSelectionProvider currently assumes that only nested editors can provide selections  This is unfortunate for FormEditor  where pages contributed as controls can also be selection source  The proposed fix is to check the active nested editor first  If the result is null  go to the multi page editor site itself and see if it has a selection provider For example public ISelection getSelection    IEditorPart activeEditor   multiPageEditor getActiveEditor   if  activeEditor    null   ISelectionProvider selectionProvider   activeEditor getSite   getSelectionProvider   if  selectionProvider    null return selectionProvider getSelection    return null  should be rewritten to bepublic ISelection getSelection    IEditorPart activeEditor   multiPageEditor getActiveEditor   if  activeEditor    null   ISelectionProvider selectionProvider   activeEditor getSite   getSelectionProvider   if  selectionProvider    null return selectionProvider getSelection            else            ISelectionProvider selectionProvider   multiPageEditor getSite   getSelectionProvider                   if  selectionProvider    null                         return selectionProvider getSelection            return null  I didn t check other classes similar to this one  but in general  MultiPageEditorPart and its site should be given a try if active nested editor is not found  ,5

69516, EditorMgmt  Ability to plug in alternative editors  for example GVIM or emacs, I raised this point at a JavaOne eclipse BOF but we never got a chance to talk about it  Here is the idea in full You should be able to plug in an alternative editor rather than using the editor th For example  you should be able to write a plugin th Note that I am not talking about  VI key bindings   which would not add any functionality to eclipse  but rather I am talking about using GVIM as an OLE object within Eclipse via a plugin  gaining access to the full power of the GVIM  or other  software For reference a competing product  the Intellij IDEA IDE  has a plugin that wraps around GVIM as an OLE object  It renders the text within the Intellij window so that all of the smart IDE features still work  syntax highlighting  hyper navigation  mouse overs  etc   but the text buffer itself is actually managed by vim  It is not just a set of keybindings that are VI like  it actually wraps VIM as an OLE object  The plugin forwards the key strokes to the VIM editor  and VIM has support for this kind of use  The feature should not be VIM specific but should enable plugin writers to create plugins for any editor with API bindings That all said I do have to wonder why in this day in age anyone would ever set out to write a new editor  There are a lot of mature  reliable  well known  and widely used editors out there that are all better than the paltry homegrown and necessarily immature editor provided in Eclipse  gvim  emacs  ultraedit  textpad  etc   etc   etc  Allowing eclipse to integrate with the users default preferred editor not only buys you a better editor  it provides for seamless integration with the rest of the platform  and saves you the trouble of having to write one Catching up with the functionality provided by VIM or EMACS or whatnot is a herculean task that will only serve to distract the eclipse team from working on its core values  the smarts about navigating  indexing  cross referencing  refactoring  debugging  and generally building software  ,5

80226, Contributions  dynamic  MenuManager overrides data for dynamic menu items, After a long debugging session  I finally found what is causing the new macro recorder to get really confused The new macro recorder player tries to avoid the fragility of low level events by tracking higher  semantic  events like selections  It works great with static menu items  However  dynamic menu items suffer from the following problem Most dynamic submenus follow the same pattern ie  they contribute a custom contribution item that creates actions on the fly  then calls each action contribution item to fill in the provided menu When initially created  menu items correctly get the ActionContributionItem set as data  MenuItem setData   However  the following code in MenuManager  line 605             int start   menu getItemCount              src fill menu  destIx             int newItems   menu getItemCount     start            for  int i   0  i  lt  newItems  i                    MenuItem item   menu getItem destIx                   item setData src              I debugged the code above and it seems that it replaces data for each dynamically build action menu item with the data for the parent contribution item  For example  all the menu items for the  Open Perspective  menu have the same data  ChangeToPerspectiveMenu   This makes it impossible to get to the unique perspective Id and reliably reach the same menu item during playback  The same story repeats for other dynamic menus  Show View  New    etc   Is this behaviour intended or just a bug  It seems counter intuitive to me th ,5

240394,workspace file locking and other issues with JSF tag introspection, We are using WTP 3 0 in an adopter product and have discovered major problems with the introspection code for JSF tags   The main issue is file locking of all jars in  WEB INF lib  which prevents refactoring or deletion of the project s  for the entire workbench session   This appears to be an issue with the way JEM is being used to instantiate classes from inside project jars which results in unclosed file handles until the Eclipse JVM process is terminated Furthermore  after classes are loaded  and the jars therefore locked  there are a substantial number of uncaught exceptions appearing in the error log regarding missing fields methods and also problems instantiating component classes in some cases Steps to reproduce  Create a new dynamic web project with the JSF facet  either 1 1 or 1 2  Add any JSF jar file to  WEB INF lib in this project   I used the MyFaces Tomahawk library jar to demonstrate these problems  Open the Tag Registry view Open up the tree in this view and find the taglib URI of the library just added  ex      Now open the node for that taglib URI and introspecting kicks inFirst  the locking issue   This is a trace of the file access that touched the tomahawk jar     sun misc URLClassPath JarLoader access 700 URLClassPath java 646     sun misc URLClassPath

485220, General  Releng  Provide a more modular architecture   amp  builds  for Papyrus, In order to get faster feedback on Gerrit builds  we need to build smaller components  However  the current structure does not properly support this  due to several issues   Not all plug ins properly implement the Papyrus architecture  e g  some infra plug ins depend on UML or GMF   The build is split into 4 units  Main  Main Tests  Extra  Extra Tests   We should get more smaller units  e g  Infra Core  Views  Diagrams  Tables  UML Diagrams  UML Tables   The tests should be closer to the tested components  to be able to run tests when building tested components  Currently we can only run  Main Tests  or  Extra Tests   The lack of clear API doesn t provide enough confidence when changing core components  so we need to rebuild retest everything to ensure that we don t break anyoneSome components that could be improved  This list is not exhaustive    Extract the ServicesRegistry outside infra core  Or  separate Services from Sash Editor   This  core  plug in includes both UI Components  Sash Editor  and core service management  Services ServiceRegistry   Most plug in depend on it for Services  but end up with a strong UI dependency  ModelExplorer  UI Trees in general   Semantic Model  amp  Content provider  Currently  the only abstraction we have for a  Semantic Model  is the IModel interface UmlModel implementation  When we want to retrieve the  Semantic Model  of Papyrus  And content provider   we need to depend on uml tools   Palette  The palette framework has a dependency to UML to support profiles  This means thpalette depends on UML although it simply contributes a Post Action for the generic palette framework   Remove the strong dependency on the   uml file extension  which makes it impossible to support normative XMI in Papyrus  OMG XMI URIs  properly supported by Eclipse UML   This extension is used in many places in PapyrusThis task is not related to the build issue but still makes sense for a more modular architecture  It is also probably more complex    Diagram Runtime  GMF is split between  GMF Runtime  and  GMF Diagram UI   The first one doesn t depend on GEF   We don t do this distinction in Papyrus  which means th We should have a clearer separation of the Runtime and UI components for the diagrams ,2

37154, Team  Support for subversion, One of my biggest gripes with CVS is the lack of directory metadata Subversion is a version control system which is very similar to CVS  except ittries to fix a number of the CVS shortcomings such as the lack of directorymetadata  The CVS integration in eclipse is one of the best CVS client implementations Ihave seen  and I would love to have an eclipse subversion integration thatworked as well as the CVS one Since there is a fair amount of overlap in behavior between CVS and subversion it probably wouldn t be that hard to rework the cvs plugins to add support forsubversion   Obviously  this would be a lot easier for the people that wrote thecvs plugins than for someone starting from scratch that had to learn theexisting code  ,5
37069, grammar  compiler allows package name containing  aspect  keyword, This bug was originally found by Charles Zhang and reported as an AJDT problem on our newsgroup   I think it s an AspectJ compiler problem  and so am reporducing it here I am using AspectJ 1 1rc1 on Win2K The problem first manifested using the Eclipse AJDT plugin   If you create a package called  aspect test  and then create an aspect MyAspect in that package  you get an error  Error Syntax error on token  aspect    Identifier  expected   the error is flagged on the bad package name    I assume this is because  aspect  is a keyword in AspectJ  so this is expected behaviour  ideally we could catch it when the package is created  but we d have to write a specialised AspectJ New Package Wizard for that   Right now  Java keywords are caught by that wizard  so you can t create a new package called  class foo   e g  The unusual behaviour is that this program  with aspect  MyAspect  in package  aspect test   does compile using ajc from the command line  and runs   On the other hand  a class in a package called  class foo  will not build with ajc  you get the error  identifier expected  on the  class foo  name    This seems inconsistent  both between the behaviour of Java keywords versus AspectJ keywords  as well as between the ide versus the commandline    I would expect a similar  identifier expected  error when I try to use  apsect foo  as an identifier  ,5

383365,consider keeping a copy of pre reqs used in our builds,   As documented there and related bugs there were a lot of changes in ECF trying to get meta data right  with least impact on existing clients  But  in the end  for the very final one  it was deemed too late to respin RC4 for this problem  since we were already past our deadline  and it was not considered a  blocking  problem  As a result the version of ECF we used in our release was not the same as the version ECF released  The qualifiers differed  though  content was the same  the metadata in repository changed   The qualifier we used was v20120608 0148 and the qualifier they released was  v20120610 1946  In other words  we could not exactly  rebuild  our release  such as for a hot fix patch  since the versions with v20120608 0148 is now gone   Well  it does exist in our own repository     but to build with it  would take some magic to extract it  into a form acceptable for  prereq      or  update our map files  etc    While I think this is an extremely rare problem  in theory it could be a serious one  don t think it is in this case     but     this bugzilla is about the principle of the thing   Thus  thought I d open this bug to track the consideration of  us  saving a copy of every pre req we use to build our releases   Technically  this could extend to VMs  etc      but  I m mostly concerned about the smaller things here    ,5

74487, IDE  project checkout should be extensible, Creators of a given type of project should be able to  hook into  itscheckout  Use case User create a J2EE project  using  e g   the Dynamic Web Project inCorona  named  foo   The creation wizard offers  default accept  tocreate an EAR project fooEAR referencing foo  This allows the user todeploy test foo more easily After completion  user checks foo in Some time later  user checks out foo for maintenance into a blankworkspace  User makes changes  and seeks to test the changes  butcannot deploy test without an EAR project  User must run the EARproject wizard It Would Be Nice if checkout was sufficiently extensible that  oncheckout of a J2EE project  the user could be offered to create anEAR  It Would Be Nicer if the checkout process  view and control codewas sufficiently extensible that folks who write extensions toproject creation wizards could just  hook in  appropriateproject creation extension pages operations to the checkoutUI operations  ,5
76042, Markers  Premature notification sent to VCS when bringing up QuickFix, If you have a file checked into source control and press CTRL 1 on an annotation to bring up the QuickFix list  edit notification is sent to the VCS and the file is considered  modified  even though no modification has occurred yet  and may never occur   For example  the user may dismiss the QuickFix list  or may select the QuickFix item to add a word to the spell checker dictionary   VCS edit notification should only be sent when accepting a QuickFix would actually result in the file under source control being modified  ,5
76073, IDE  opening project In new window can lead to incorrect title bar text, After opening a project in a new window and then closing the original window before closing the second window  consequently shutting down eclipse   the nexttime you start up eclipse  the text in the title bar alway reads the projectname of the project th  This persists even afterclosing thThe workaround is to open a new Window  Window  gt  New Window  and then close thewindow with the misleading title bar text first  ,5
76157, IDE  Open Resource   Right click on the directories for each resource could provide actions, I often search for files with a special meaning to Windows but not to Eclipse which Eclipse then delegates to Windows to open   An example is a PNG file where I basically do not want to work with the contents but the directorycontaining the file I therefore type in the file name  and see several folders where this fileexist   i would then like to be able to right click on the folders and be ableto in some way work with the folder   Examples coul dbe   Show file in Navigator   Open folder in Windows or Navigator  Just the  Open with     functionality seen elsewhere  ,5
76380, IDE  Allow SaveAs to update Most Recently Used list, Currently there seems to be no way to update the MRU list when performing asave as  Especially in RCP it is often desired to redirect the editor input to the newfile location  There should be a way to also include that new file into the MRUlist  ,5
77286, KeyBindings   RCP  RCP friendly keys preference page, 3 0The keys preference page is not yet API  see   but when it is there areproblems using it with RCP applications  There are two ways for an RCPapplication to define key bindings for commands 1  define then in the default key configuration  with the caveat that there aremany keys already assigned by org eclipse ui2  define a new key configuration and assign all key bindings for yourapplication to the new configuration The problem will be that although the keys are assigned to a configuration essentially scoping them  the keys preference page shows ALL commands aspossibly key bindable  This is because the workbench has no concept of commandnamespaces  or command configurations  It becomes confusing because all RCPapplications inherit org eclipse ui commands and dialog or pages that simplydisplay all commands are useless in a RCP applications because the listedcommands may not make sense in th ,5
77782, IDE  Can t move a project that s been moved outside of Eclipse , If I move an Eclipse project from outside of Eclipse  there s no  obvious  wayto point the Eclipse project   The move commanddoesn t appear in the project s context menu  and the project location field inthe project properties isn t editable   I had to delete the project and re import it   There should be an easier way todo this This is for projects outside of the Eclipse workspace  ,5

79887, Import Export  Zip Export should preserve permissions, Step to reproduce 1  Create project with a text file 2  Set the file as read only in the properties  ensure read only is set properlyoutside of eclipse   rw r  r   3  Export as a zip file4  Unpack the zip file  in eclipse it s no longer marked as read only confirming the permissions of the files outside of eclipse on the command lineone gets  rw rw r  One gets similar results if you give the file executable permissions as well Expected Results The zip operation should preserve read only and executable permissions  ,5
80184, Import Export  imorting subfolder from zip is not possible, when trying to import a subfolder into a project the folder above the wanted onegets imported as well so when you just want the src folder from a  myProject   gt  src  dir structure inyour zip you always end up importing the myProject folder with its src folderunderneath  ,5
80247, IDE  Add open external directory, Just like it is useful to open an external file  it would be nice to be able toopen an external directory This directory would appear and behave much like a resource project  making itpossible to browse  search  edit  compare  etc  files directories via a external project navigator  of some sort  yvind ,5
80310, Markers  Minimized Problems view has incorrect high lighting, build 2004 12 01I have the Problems view minimized I have filtered turned on so it only shows me things of ERROR severity Frequently the table of the view is in bold face  indicating that something inthe view has changed  But when I open the view  nothing is new because my filterdoesn t show it The view bold face font should only happen when there are actual changes to theview with the filter being applied  ,5
80538, IDE  project description popup, I think it would be kind of nice if the  package explorer  or  navigator  had aplace to see a short project description  like a tool tip for example   Even ifyou right click and choose properties there is no place showing a simpledescription   I think the properties  Info  page would be a perfect location forus to enter a one line project description    perhaps just a place to show theinitial cvs log comment  ,5
80969, Import Export  Import Project by drag and drop, Creating a new workspace for a suite of active projects is a real pain since it is necessary to go through the Import dialog for each project  Using a ProjectSet only works if under CVS  and when something magic hashappened to the workspace  then I want to create a new one for my currentstate  before I commit to CVS    a  How about allowing folders containing  project files  and or the project files  to be dropped onto the Navigator Package Explorer windowto indicate an Import Existing Project b  How about allowing a multi select of sibling folders when browsing in theImport Existing Project dialog  ,5
81055, Dialogs  Contents of dialogs to wide to be fully displayed with non standard desktop theme, The contents of the dialog windows is to wide to be fully shown inside thewindows although they already come up with their maximum width  Reducing thewidth of the window doesn t effect the components  even more of them vanishes For example in the  Java Code Style Code Templates  and  Java CodeStyle Organize Imports  branches the right hand side buttons are so far on theright and so wide that they reach out of the window and the text on them can tbe read any more  Often they don t even show any contents until I resize thewindow  Also the other dialogs are affected  e g  the  Confirm Exit  dialog I m using Eclipse 3 0 1 with Java 1 5  but the behavoir was also the same withEclipse 3 0 and Java 1 4  Even a fresh installation doesn t correct this behavoir  ,5

81804, Progress  Workbench should provide additional feedback mechanisms, It would be good if the workbench provided uniform way in which plugins couldnon obtrusivly provide feedback to the user   Currently the only real means isvia a progress dialog which interrupts the users workflow   We shouldinvestigate other mechanisms such as sounds and innocuous floating windows thatdon t take focus  think of the way MSN messenger shows notification in thebottom right corner of your screen when someone comes online   ,5

84938, RCP  Provide a way to set initial application window position, When an RCP application  or even the Eclipse IDE itself  is started for the first time  the window position is such that the app window extends past the screen s display area  if the app window s size is close to the size of the screen    There seems to be no way to change the default starting location of the application window An implementation of IWorkbenchWindowConfigurer setInitialPosition      would be great   it would allow an RCP application to set the default window position in the WorkbenchAdvisor preWindowOpen      method  along with the default window size  ,5

97780, Model  Make BaseWorkbenchContentProvider and LabelProvider adapter manager friendly, I m sorry I missed this way back in M5  but I just realized that I hadn tsubmitted patches to enable the Workbench s default content and label providersto use the adapter factory  Actually  the example we are using in the RCP bookshows how to use adapters and was reminded thI ve attached a patch that you can apply against v20050526 1200 that fixed boththese classes and allows you to put objects into viewers that  don t  have toimplement IAdaptable directly  instead you can register an adapter for them This is very useful when you are adding objects into a viewer from a 3rd partylibrary and you can t change their code  See  for more discussionsabout other places in the Workbench that have been changed to do this same kindof check  I actually submitted the patch for this a long time ago and justforgot about this case  So why do I think this should be put into 3 1  Well  for starters it s reallypart of the improved action contribution plan item and was just plain forgotten It s a low risk fix because the IAdaptable check is still done in the sameorder  which in case of existing viewers would mean that this is the code thatwill still run  If the object is not adaptable  then the adapter manager ischecked  There is a small performance hit if the objects don t adapt toIAdaptable but since this was enforced  it won t affect any existing plug ins  The only contraversal issue in the patch is thloadAdapter  is called instead of getAdapter    This is for the same reason as stated in Bug86362 ,5
97804, Import Export   UI blocked during importing lot of files, when i start an import from the filesystem of many files the ui blocks for the time eclipse is counting the files  this is done before the real import is starting  not until all files are counted the import starts and shows the progress on the progress bar during counting there is no way to cancel the operation and the ui is blocked  there should be the reason to do so the problem is very critical when importing lot of files from a network drives or filesystems with symbolic links the only way to cancel such an operation is to kill the eclipse process  ,5

105603, IDE  Adding folder to workspace with File  gt  New  gt  Project is counter intuitive inconsistent, There are two ways to add an existing project to the workspace   File  gt  New  gt Project and Import  gt  Existing project into workspace   but only one way to addan existing folder to the workspace as a project   File  gt  New  gt  Project While this makes perfect sense to the implementation  it is counter intuitive tothe user who just wants to work on some existing files in Eclipse that the usershould  create  a project to do it  The behavior is a bit unlike any othercreation wizard in that it does not refuse to create a resource if it alreadyexists  Moreover  it seems a bit odd to the same user that Import does not work since the folder represents a  project  to the user  Import is an odd choice ofnames for this operation  odd enough that the dialog must inform the user thatthe project will not actually be copied into the workspace  The Import pathprovides no way to give an existing project a different name in the workspace Finally  using Edit  gt  Delete to remove a project from the workspace is verycounter intuitive  and kinda scary The differences between New and Import could be resolved by extending the Importwizard to deal with the folder not a project case by treating it the same  i e  converting the folder to a project if need be and adding the option to give theproject another name in the workspace Alternatively  the whole business of adding removing projects could  and I thinkshould  be extracted from New and Import and become independent menu items e g   Add Project and Remove Project  Add project would work like thealready existing folder case does in New  Remove Project would work like Edit  gt Delete for projects  The  delete  functionality could be removed from Edit  gt Delete  Instead  a dialog could advise the user to use Remove Project  ,5
