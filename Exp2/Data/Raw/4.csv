438787,Wrong ResourceFactoryDescriptor selected by J2EEModelProvider, Through org eclipse jst j2ee J2EEModelProvider extension point an extender can declare a J2EEModelProviderFactoryClass and can limit the use of this factory to a given number of facet versions  besides  the extender can use the extension point org eclipse wst common modulecore resourceFactories to declare a ResourceFactoryDescriptor for a given content type  this ResourceFactoryDescrptor is then used by the J2EEModelProvider to create the model of a project  this last is not attached to a version and for such a wrong ResourceFactoryDescrptor could be used in the right J2EEModelProvider to create the model of a project As example  An extender defines ResourceFactoryDescriptor named ApplicationResourceFactory for the ApplicationClient content type either 5 or 6  then it defines J2EEModelProvider for jst appclient versions 5 0 and 6 0  Since WTP already supports facet 7 0  when an application client project is imported with facet 7 0  the J2EEModelProvider by the extender is not used because it doesn t match with the facet version  so the org eclipse jst jee model internal AppClient5ModelProvider is used instead  Later this model provider uses the ApplicationResourceFactory provided by the extender to create the model of the project  ,3

102726,Using text size to make code more readable, Statically typed languages  such as Java  force one to have a lot of noise in the code just to keep the compiler happy  When reading the code  variable type declarations  typecasts  method return types  visibilities etc  often make the reading of the code very difficult  This is something I love e g  in Ruby   the code is very readable as there is very little noise So  I came up with an idea  IDE could be of help in reducing the noise  It would be possible to use font sizes to make the code appear so that it is easier to read  The kind of stuff I mentioned above would be in a smaller font  possibly even a different font  Scite editor uses this and having e g  comments in different font enhances the readability incredibly  thus making the reading easier    The solution should be wholly configurable  so the user could select which of the following  and possibly others   are  diminished    method return types  method visibilities  method argument types  types in variable declarations  typecastsetc  It should also be configurable what font size to use for the diminished things  possibly stating size relative to the editor font size  e g   4  I tried it out quickly in Word and I find it very appealing  please see the attached word doc The advantage of this approach is that you can still see the  noisy  elements  but it is easier to ignore them  Also  sometimes you might want to e g  see the visibilities of the methods with no  diminishing   then you could choose to do so  ,5

240394,workspace file locking and other issues with JSF tag introspection, We are using WTP 3 0 in an adopter product and have discovered major problems with the introspection code for JSF tags   The main issue is file locking of all jars in  WEB INF lib  which prevents refactoring or deletion of the project s  for the entire workbench session   This appears to be an issue with the way JEM is being used to instantiate classes from inside project jars which results in unclosed file handles until the Eclipse JVM process is terminated Furthermore  after classes are loaded  and the jars therefore locked  there are a substantial number of uncaught exceptions appearing in the error log regarding missing fields methods and also problems instantiating component classes in some cases Steps to reproduce  Create a new dynamic web project with the JSF facet  either 1 1 or 1 2  Add any JSF jar file to  WEB INF lib in this project   I used the MyFaces Tomahawk library jar to demonstrate these problems  Open the Tag Registry view Open up the tree in this view and find the taglib URI of the library just added  ex      Now open the node for that taglib URI and introspecting kicks inFirst  the locking issue   This is a trace of the file access that touched the tomahawk jar     sun misc URLClassPath JarLoader access 700 URLClassPath java 646     sun misc URLClassPath

80226, Contributions  dynamic  MenuManager overrides data for dynamic menu items, After a long debugging session  I finally found what is causing the new macro recorder to get really confused The new macro recorder player tries to avoid the fragility of low level events by tracking higher  semantic  events like selections  It works great with static menu items  However  dynamic menu items suffer from the following problem Most dynamic submenus follow the same pattern ie  they contribute a custom contribution item that creates actions on the fly  then calls each action contribution item to fill in the provided menu When initially created  menu items correctly get the ActionContributionItem set as data  MenuItem setData   However  the following code in MenuManager  line 605             int start   menu getItemCount              src fill menu  destIx             int newItems   menu getItemCount     start            for  int i   0  i  lt  newItems  i                    MenuItem item   menu getItem destIx                   item setData src              I debugged the code above and it seems that it replaces data for each dynamically build action menu item with the data for the parent contribution item  For example  all the menu items for the  Open Perspective  menu have the same data  ChangeToPerspectiveMenu   This makes it impossible to get to the unique perspective Id and reliably reach the same menu item during playback  The same story repeats for other dynamic menus  Show View  New    etc   Is this behaviour intended or just a bug  It seems counter intuitive to me th ,5

230614,Deleting source file leaves compiled java file behind, When you delete a source file in  new  language  the Java file that was compiledfrom it  if any  is not deleted along with it   This results in the accumulationof compiled Java files that have no corresponding files in the original sourcelanguage This doesn t actually break anything  and it isn t a problem for demo scale useof SAFARI IDEs  so I ve listed this bug as an  enhancement    But this situationcould be quite annoying for real IDE users who are translating their languagesinto Java  so I ve left the priority relatively high  ,5

69516, EditorMgmt  Ability to plug in alternative editors  for example GVIM or emacs, I raised this point at a JavaOne eclipse BOF but we never got a chance to talk about it  Here is the idea in full You should be able to plug in an alternative editor rather than using the editor th For example  you should be able to write a plugin th Note that I am not talking about  VI key bindings   which would not add any functionality to eclipse  but rather I am talking about using GVIM as an OLE object within Eclipse via a plugin  gaining access to the full power of the GVIM  or other  software For reference a competing product  the Intellij IDEA IDE  has a plugin that wraps around GVIM as an OLE object  It renders the text within the Intellij window so that all of the smart IDE features still work  syntax highlighting  hyper navigation  mouse overs  etc   but the text buffer itself is actually managed by vim  It is not just a set of keybindings that are VI like  it actually wraps VIM as an OLE object  The plugin forwards the key strokes to the VIM editor  and VIM has support for this kind of use  The feature should not be VIM specific but should enable plugin writers to create plugins for any editor with API bindings That all said I do have to wonder why in this day in age anyone would ever set out to write a new editor  There are a lot of mature  reliable  well known  and widely used editors out there that are all better than the paltry homegrown and necessarily immature editor provided in Eclipse  gvim  emacs  ultraedit  textpad  etc   etc   etc  Allowing eclipse to integrate with the users default preferred editor not only buys you a better editor  it provides for seamless integration with the rest of the platform  and saves you the trouble of having to write one Catching up with the functionality provided by VIM or EMACS or whatnot is a herculean task that will only serve to distract the eclipse team from working on its core values  the smarts about navigating  indexing  cross referencing  refactoring  debugging  and generally building software  ,5

188981, refactoring  Refactor refactorings to provide a library on which to build new refactoring, I wanted to write a refactoring for which I needed to find out many of the same things as Extract Method would need  is a return required  Are there any non linear paths whose destination is outside of the selected code  If the selection is extracted  whUnfortunately  when I looked  Is there any chance of refactoring this code so that a library can be provided so that other refactorings can be written by composing the pieces  without massive copying and pasting or rewriting from nothing Regards Lance ,5

13991, Contributions   Services  A site should provide access to a parts input element, Build 20020416A IWorkbenchSite give access to a selection provider and therefore to the current selection of an editor  view part or page  But a site can not be used to access an editor s  view part s or page input element  As a consequence the JDT actions which work on selections and the input element  like most of the source actions  have to keep a reference to a site and one to the editor to access the input element The action could be written simplier if the site would give access to the input element as well  ,5
496611,Improve validation and error reporting for non executable Processes, process 1 bpmnI think there is a problem with the validation of BPMN models Attached I give an example of a very simple BPMN model containing a intermediate message catch event  process 1 bpmn   The BPMN2 modeller plugin indicates an error  Intermediate Catch Event 1 has no Message definition I don t think thI saw th0 Validation When I disable this all validations are disabled  This is great    But now also useful validations like a wrong sequence flow from a catch event are ignored  This validation is very useful in general because this indicates a general  runtime independent  model error   see example  process 2 bpmn  Can we split the validation rules in runtime specific and runtime independent rule  ,2

259975,JPA TESTS NOT RE RUNABLE CONSISTENT, This bug is originated from a bug for TopLink in Oracle bug base   James Sutherland Many of the JPA tests have been written to make debugging of failures more difficult    Many of the tests begin a transaction  but do not put the commit rollback in a finally  and never close the EntityManager  this will lead to a cascading of failures if one of these tests fail  i e  many test in EntityManager test suite    Many of the tests are dependent on previous tests running successfully  i e  update tests depends on insert test running before it  and delete test depends on update test running  test should only be dependent on the Suite setup  never other tests  i e  inherited tests   Some of the tests create the suite from the test class  this does not give consistent test ordering  which can cause inconsistent and difficult to debug failures  i e  entity manager test suite    Many of the tests cannot be run twice in a row  i e  DDL tests  XML merge tests A few tests were fixed to define consistent ordering to run in the server but for the most part all of the above are still issues  ,4

43603, rulers  QuickDiff provider usability concerns, From another PR Having used the quick diff with  version on disk  and the new  cvs provider  fora little while now   I have some questions and comments 1  Currently  it is very hard to find out that your file has changes withoutscrolling  I didn t find which hot keys to use to  select next previous change  I understand that you want to show line changes but there is no way to findthem  For example  in compare editors the overview ruler shows were the changesare and the select next previous are used to navigate  Maybe we need an editordecoration to hint that it s changed based on the reference document  A hintthat you should look for changes 2  The bar is so narrow th What is the hotkeyfor showing the change  Also what are the hotkeys for replacing the changes 3  Have you thought of providing 3 way diff support  With the CVS quick diffprovider it will be really useful to see the direction of the change tounderstand if you made the change or if it was made remotely         Additional  From Tom Eicher 2003 08 10 17 57        1  I agree   we would need a toggable indication on the overview ruler similarto the one provided by the compare editor  Whether we will want shortcuts ornot  I am not sure   go to previous   next is usually assigned to something elsealready  e g  next problem in Java Editor   so we would have to introduce newshortcuts  2  There are no hotkeys so far   as a workaround for the narrow ruler  if linenumbers are turned on  the ruler gets wider  Instead of using hotkeys forundoing a change  the related actions can be acessed via the ruler s contextmenu  Ctrl W   3  The quick diff indication was really thought as a lightweight changeindication  and I am also considering a shortcutto open the full fledged compareeditor from a change Note th theshortest edit script from reference document to actual  because it is computedincrementally  Try moving around lines for a demonstration of the currentalgorithm s limitations  ,5

424501, rulers  Text editors  Only show scroll bars when necessary, Currently  Eclipse text editors always show the horizontal and vertical scroll bars  Depending on code style  a horizontal scroll bar may never actually be used  the text is already wrapped after a certain column  Since  in SWT is fixed since 3 8  setAlwaysShowScrollBars false  could be used to make StyledText only show the scroll bars if they are actually necessary This would give the user a bit more precious vertical or horizontal space in some situations and reduces visual clutter  ,5
