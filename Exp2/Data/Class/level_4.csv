230723,Computations of default package class names scattered across wizard classes, Practically all of our wizards generate one or more implementation classes  and the computation of the default names for these classes and their packages occurs in several places  some in wizard base classes  or their near derivatives   some in particular wizards   As a result  uniform naming and casing conventions have not always been followed  and modifications to these conventions require changes in multiple places  the full set of which can only be discovered with some effort    To alleviate this problem  we should come up with some centralized utilities for computing names for packages and classes  and whatever else  based on parameters such as project  language  and service name   Such a centralized utility would also make it easier for IDE developers to modify the default naming conventions    This might appreciate especially for those wizards  if there are any  where we don t give the developer direct control over the naming of an implementation class  Originally I thought th ,4
