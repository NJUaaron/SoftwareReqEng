240394,workspace file locking and other issues with JSF tag introspection, We are using WTP 3 0 in an adopter product and have discovered major problems with the introspection code for JSF tags   The main issue is file locking of all jars in  WEB INF lib  which prevents refactoring or deletion of the project s  for the entire workbench session   This appears to be an issue with the way JEM is being used to instantiate classes from inside project jars which results in unclosed file handles until the Eclipse JVM process is terminated Furthermore  after classes are loaded  and the jars therefore locked  there are a substantial number of uncaught exceptions appearing in the error log regarding missing fields methods and also problems instantiating component classes in some cases Steps to reproduce  Create a new dynamic web project with the JSF facet  either 1 1 or 1 2  Add any JSF jar file to  WEB INF lib in this project   I used the MyFaces Tomahawk library jar to demonstrate these problems  Open the Tag Registry view Open up the tree in this view and find the taglib URI of the library just added  ex      Now open the node for that taglib URI and introspecting kicks inFirst  the locking issue   This is a trace of the file access that touched the tomahawk jar     sun misc URLClassPath JarLoader access 700 URLClassPath java 646     sun misc URLClassPath

481272,Discovered a number of bugs in Performance  display  functions, Move of these are related to hard to find hardcoded assumptions about build names  Namely  th Plus  apparently  it was assume R builds were named with two dates  such as R3 5 200510101000 200510101000  I can find no instances of builds named with underscores on archives site  and none th My hope is there is not something that  changes format  upon putting into the database  Plus  there were some hard coded values th My initial fix will fix many of those assumptions  but  admit  I have fixed  for now  by still using hard coded values             Plus  there were lots of places where exceptions were ignored or invalid  input parameters  were being ignored  I have increased the error checking           I will say  though  th            My strategy is to fix some of these obvious problems  and  reset  the data base to empty  which will make it easier to figure out if  wrong build  is used when running a  reference test  or if it is being miscoded  I addition  may find other cases of hard coding assumptions  ,2
