416619,Need to improve  and document  the way feature qualifiers are  auto incremented , And  wouldn t hurt to do the same for bundle qualifiers    This bug  and  yes  it is a bug  not an enhancement request     continues the discussion started in   But in general  we waste too much time having  failed builds  because some qualifier doesn t increment  thus get s  swapped out  by comparator  thus causing failures later since not all qualifiers  line up  or match wh In particular  in bug  it is was stated  Internally Tycho converts qualifiers to commit dates  and  bump version  commit is necessary if multiple qualifier formats are referenced from the same feature  Now  we ve gotten  used to  the fact th But  in  if was a regular code bundle th It appears  from  the outside   th Is there more we can do in Eclipse Platform  For example  if the Orbit bundles are all listed xml  would that then enable the current heuristic to work  Does the heuristic stop trying  as soon as it detects there is a mix of  qualifier types  in a feature  ,1
