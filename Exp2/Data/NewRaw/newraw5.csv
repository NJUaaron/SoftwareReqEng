390313,Consider using XCore for GMF Tooling models, GMFT recognizes increasing popularity of XCore inside the Eclipse modeling  In order to be consistent and support currency  GMFT needs to consider using an XCore XBase  Within Kepler release the usage will be limited to GMF T internals and most probably will not affect the end user  toolsmith s  experience  which is the next step to be considered for later release  We see the following steps of this migration    Provide XCore versions of GMFT input models   Migrate as much as possible of the QVTo helpers from templates to the XCore defined operations or derived features   however backward compatibility should be taken into account here  it is possible th  In the M2M transformation consider using the same process as it is done within the X framework to transform XCore to ECore  Replacing the actual QVTo helpers with the operations defined within X framework will reduce dependency from QVTo inside the GMFT code generation and thus should help with getting back to using the standard templates language  see  ,3

133894, project creation  Renaming of JavaSource to src is not a good idea, In WTP 1 0 1  you renamed the JavaSource folder to src  I agree that  src  is more of a standard than  JavaSource   so it seemed like a good idea at firstWell  it is not such a good idea  Eclipse beling linked to CVS  it is used to manage other  src  files than Java source files  For example  I use to store my Photoshop  psp  source files inside my projects  Until now  I had a folder called  NonJavaSource   with a  psp  sub folder  If you do want to have a  src  folder  it would make more sense to have a  src  folder and have a  java  folder under it The same thing goes for your   deployable  folder  It was a good idea to change the name  because Windows doesn t like folder names starting with a dot  However  the  build  folder is commonly used to store the ant script  or any script to build the program  I would suggest a better name such as  stage  or  staging   ,3

315975, Discovery  DNS SD  Flagship Naming  default protocol  for service types, Expires 8th September 2010         Cheshire  amp  Krochmal          Page 23 Internet Draft         DNS Based Service Discovery        8th March 2010 Flagship Naming   In some cases  there may be several network protocols available   which all perform roughly the same logical function  For example    the printing world has the LPR protocol  and the Internet Printing   Protocol  IPP   both of which cause printed sheets to be emitted   from printers in much the same way  In addition  many printer vendors   send their own proprietary page description language  PDL  data   over a TCP connection to TCP port 9100  herein referred to as the    pdl datastream  protocol  In an ideal world we would have only one   network printing protocol  and it would be sufficiently good that no   one felt a compelling need to invent a different one  However  in   practice  multiple legacy protocols do exist  and a service discovery   protocol has to accommodate that    Many printers implement all three printing protocols  LPR  IPP  and   pdl datastream  For the benefit of clients that may speak only one of   those protocols  all three are advertised    However  some clients may implement two  or all three of those   printing protocols  When a client looks for all three service types   on the network  it will find three distinct services    an LPR   service  an IPP service  and a pdl datastream service    all of which   cause printed sheets to be emitted from the same physical printer    In the case of multiple protocols like this that all perform   effectively the same function  the client should suppress duplicate   names and display each name only once  When the user prints to a   given named printer  the printing client is responsible for choosing   the protocol which will best achieve the desired effect  without  for   example  requiring the user to make a manual choice between LPR and   IPP    As described so far  this all works very well  However  consider some   future printer that only supports IPP printing  and some other future   printer th The name spaces   for different service types are intentionally disjoint    it is   acceptable and desirable to be able to have both a file server called    Sales Department  and a printer called  Sales Department   However Expires 8th September 2010         Cheshire  amp  Krochmal          Page 24 Internet Draft         DNS Based Service Discovery        8th March 2010   it is not desirable  in the common case  to have two different   printers both called  Sales Department   just because those printers   implement different protocols    To help guard against this  when there are two or more network   protocols which perform roughly the same logical function  one of   the protocols is declared the  flagship  of the fleet of related   protocols  Typically the flagship protocol is the oldest and or   best known protocol of the set    If a device does not implement the flagship protocol  then it instead   creates a placeholder SRV record  priority 0  weight 0  port 0    target host   hostname of device  with th If  when it   attempts to create this SRV record  it finds that a record with the   same name already exists  then it knows that this name is already   taken by some other entity implementing at least one of the protocols   from the fleet  and it must choose another  If no SRV record already   exists  then the act of creating it stakes a claim to that name so   that future devices in the same protocol fleet will detect a conflict   when they try to use it    Note  When used with Multicast DNS  mDNS   the target host field of   the placeholder SRV record MUST NOT be the empty root label  The SRV   record needs to contain a real target host name in order for the   Multicast DNS conflict detection rules to operate  If two different   devices were to create placeholder SRV records both using a null   target host name  just the root label   then the two SRV records   would be seen to be in agreement so no conflict would be registered    By defining a common well known flagship protocol for the class    future devices that may not even know about each other s protocols   establish a common ground where they can coordinate to verify   uniqueness of names    No PTR record is created advertising the presence of empty flagship   SRV records  since they do not represent a real service being   advertised   ,3

353257,dependency circle between cdt core and cdt managedbuilder core, Build Identifier  The activator classes of the cdt core  CCorePlugin and the cdt managedbuilder core ManagedBuilderCorePlugin do load each other during their start handling If one thread is using an class type from the cdt core plugin while another one is using a type from the cdt managedbuilder core  then the 2 threads end up in a dependency loop  equinox detects this for each class loaded and breaks the loop after 5 seconds In the end I see thI actually do not see this when starting up eclipse normally  only when using our test runner The CCorePlugin start behavior loading the managed builder was introduced with  in order to address a delay loading problem The ManagedBuilderCorePlugin class just needs stuff implemented in cdt core Reproducible  SometimesSteps to Reproduce I can provide the call stacks easily  however the code using cdt core and cdt managedbuild core is custom for both threads I hope the call stacks eclipse  log file shows the problem clearly enough  if needed I can try to create a custom test One case the Worker 4 is activating org eclipse cdt managedbuilder core  see

508853,The method CDOUtil setCredentialsProvider seems incoherent with CDONet4jViewProvider credentials handling, was suggested in  to use CDOUtil setCredentialsProvider URI  IPasswordCredentialsProvider  to avoid having credentials in URI so CDONet4jViewProvider getNet4jSessionConfiguration can retrieve the credentials without passing those in the URI The problem is thIndeed  in the method CDONet4jViewProvider getNet4jSessionConfiguration we have the following code  StringBuilder builder   new StringBuilder   append builder  connector  repositoryName  String resource   builder toString    private void append StringBuilder builder  IConnector connector  String repositoryName        String authority   getURIAuthority connector      builder append authority      builder append          builder append repositoryName     We can see thOr in CDOUtil  we have the following code   CDOURIData data   new CDOURIData uri      data setUserName null      data setPassWord null      data setResourcePath null      data setBranchPath null      data setTimeStamp CDOBranchPoint UNSPECIFIED DATE      data setTransactional false      String resource   data toString   with    Override  public String toString         StringBuilder builder   new StringBuilder       builder append scheme      builder append            if  userName    null    So we will register a credential provider like net4j    localhost 2036 repoin CDOUtil and matche again localhost 2036 repo in CDONet4jViewProviderOf course I could set a credentials provider for the proper resource without using CDOUtil setCredentialsProvider but I think it would be cleaner to use it So I would like to do a patch adding a method org eclipse emf cdo net4j CDONet4jViewProvider getNet4jSession IConnector  CDOURIData  that will retrieve the credential provider with the code   credentialsProvider    IPasswordCredentialsProvider getContainer   getElement CredentialsProviderFactory PRODUCT GROUP   password   uriData toString    and using it in org eclipse emf cdo net4j CDONet4jViewProvider getView URI  ResourceSet  CDONet4jViewProvider getNet4jSession is the only place in CDO using the group CredentialsProviderFactory PRODUCT GROUP and type  password  with the  CDOUtil setCredentialsProvider method so I think they should be coherent Does it makes sense or am I missing something  ,3

259569,No  easy  way to call OSGi plug in APIs from outside OSGi, My company produces software development tools  such as static analysis tools  Often  those tools are invoked from the command line or from an Eclipse GUI  But sometimes  they must be invoked by direct Java calls from existing java systems  build systems  web servers etc   Those existing systems are hundreds of times larger than our simple tools so we can t impose requirements on how they work We would like some of our tools to use OSGi internally  OSGi s a greSo  how can I expose my plug in APIs to the outside world   Remember  these APIs use OSGi internally to load plug ins  Options   Allow client to instantiate my API classes directly by using the JARs  Problem  their defining class loader will not be an OSGi bundle class loader  which means loading plug ins won t work because Platform getExtensionRegistry doesn t work unless you re loaded by such a class loader   Persuade my customers to structure part of their code as an IApplication  and run th  Add a mechanism to EclipseStarter  or similar classes  to ask for an IExtensionRegistry  or similar   This could be called from inside or outside Eclipse  meaning our clients could instantiate our APIs using their own class loaders  Yet those APIs will still be able to load other plug ins   Add an API where the client to these APIs can declare itself a user of some given plugin or package within OSGi  They then get their class loader fiddled with  such thThe closest I can come is a class which will run a  Runnable  with access to OSGi plug in APIs as described

some mechanism which fulfils the same need  But before that  here s a load of questions for anyone reading this bug 1  Is there some completely different way to achieve the same objectives 2  For example  if my client instantiates my APIs directly  using their own class loader  I d like to use Platform getExtensionRegistry  or similar  to load OSGi plug ins  Even though I m not a plug in  since I ve been loaded using normal class loader schemes  This seems logically sensible   it allows OSGi to be used for parts of systems without the whole thing being modularised  Is there a way to do this 3  If I m forced to stick with the above hacks  are there better ways to achieve parts of it 4  For example  is there a way retrospectively to change the class loader which will be used by a Java class to load other classes  Then we could simply retro fit the hybrid class loader to a class without having to mess about force instantiating a Runnable   The loading of the Runnable is hugely fragile  and in itself imposes restrictions upon the way the outside code is structured  5  If not  is there some way I can ask the current ClassLoader to instantiate the Runnable  but ensure that the JVM marks me as definining it 6  Is there a nicer way to squeeze an OSGi classloader out of OSGi  without having to fake a plug in 7  The main purpose of this bug  could some sort of  less horrible  mechanism to fulfil the same purpose be added to OSGi Equinox Eclipse  Or  better still  could an equivalent of Platform getExtensionRegistry be added so it can be called outside of OSGi  ,3

247928, Formatter  Provide enhance newline policy for curly braces, Hi Unfortunately I belong to those who are really picky about their code format    The Java formatter is really great   Only one thing is missing for me and this becomes more important the more committers join my project  CDO  I m not able to express the following format policy     if  cond                      lt        Remove all newlines after opening curly braces  1       if  cond                           stmt                                 lt        Force 1 newline between closing and opening curly braces  2                    stmt                        lt        Remove all newlines between two closing curly braces  3                             lt        Force 1 newline after closing curly brace  if  no more closing curly braces follow  4       stmt                        lt        Force 1 newline before comments  5          comment         comment      stmt         2  could be included in  4  already My intention is to better highlight  blocks  of code  Of course all this is subjective but I have evidence that it is appealing to certain people        Even if you re willing to consider this request I m not sure about the best way to presentthe functionality to the user  But I d be glad to take part in a discussion  Thanks for your great work in general Eike ,5

209809, Duplicate Detection  Provide a way to compare stack trace of a new bug with the search results, When creating new tasks with a stack trace I m able to search for duplicates in a task repository  using stack trace as so called detector   If found  a list of potential duplicates will be presented  WhMy suggestion is to add a context menu entry for the task search result list  but only when searching for a duplicates basing on the stack trace  which when clicked would open the compare editor dialog  The compare editor could be extended with ability to ignore line numbers package changes if needed This could help me to identify if the task found is a duplicated indeed I would be happy to help  actually I ve been thinking about providing the patch itself  Just let me know if it sounds like a reasonable enhancement to you  ,5
