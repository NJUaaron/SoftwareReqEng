416619,Need to improve  and document  the way feature qualifiers are  auto incremented , And  wouldn t hurt to do the same for bundle qualifiers    This bug  and  yes  it is a bug  not an enhancement request     continues the discussion started in   But in general  we waste too much time having  failed builds  because some qualifier doesn t increment  thus get s  swapped out  by comparator  thus causing failures later since not all qualifiers  line up  or match wh In particular  in bug  it is was stated  Internally Tycho converts qualifiers to commit dates  and  bump version  commit is necessary if multiple qualifier formats are referenced from the same feature  Now  we ve gotten  used to  the fact th But  in  if was a regular code bundle th It appears  from  the outside   th Is there more we can do in Eclipse Platform  For example  if the Orbit bundles are all listed xml  would that then enable the current heuristic to work  Does the heuristic stop trying  as soon as it detects there is a mix of  qualifier types  in a feature  ,1

550918,Javadoc   protected  visibility for malformed doc comments hides this  default  reference, When I change or set the visibility of a class to default  package visible   Eclipse  with JavaDoc warnings enabled and scope set to protected  JavaDoc warnings produce warnings for all   link  and  see reference on public methods in this type Valid Example public class Example1    public void foo                 Like   link  foo    but with bar       see  foo         public void bar        Invalid Example class Example2    public void foo                 Like   link  foo    but with bar       see  foo         public void bar        So in Example2 Eclipse produces warnings for the  link and the  see tag saying Javadoc   protected  visibility for malformed doc comments hides this  default  referenceIMHO this is a bug as there is nothing wrong here  There is no public API pointing to a refence of a scope not included in the JavaDoc  If you treBe aware that also this is not redering a warning as it is perfectly fine public class Example3    void foo                 Like   link  foo    but with bar       see  foo         void bar        By reducing the visibility from public to default I do not want to be forced to remove valuable information as my JavaDoc  of course the example has no value and is just nonsense   However these wrong warnings imply users to do so  ,3
419136, compiler  optional warning for identity comparison values of  Uninterned types,  into a general purpose feature Following  this could be done by introducing an annotation org eclipse jdt annotation Uninterned  technically this change might actually be pretty easy Here are a few design options we need to decide  a  positive or negative annotations  The  site has a few mentionings of  Interned  quoting a study counting numbers of required annotations  among which   1 annotation per 1736 lines for interning annotations   Interned     This boils down to the question  which default will require fewer annotations or produce fewer useless warnings  b  type annotation or declaration annotation  Obviously the JSR308 site speaks of  Interned as a TYPE USE annotation  but I m not convinced th c  inheritance  implicit vs  explicit   do we anticipate cases where types in the same inheritance hierarchy have different interning semantics  If so  we may want to require each subtype to explicitly state its  un interning  Otherwise annotating a supertype can be used as an abbreviation for annotating an entire inheritance tree  Will overriding of an inherited annotation be legal  This should be seen in connection to  a  I think the literature will probably have the answers already  We just need to check if we believe these answers to be sufficiently pragmatic for large scale real world use  ,3

188591,Hide package s  or jar s  from the editor, hiIt would be nice  if I could hide a package  optionally with subpackages  from the java editor while it is still in the classpath for the compiler  The same should be possible for a whole jar  And the order of the included jars  in order and export  should be taken into account for the classnames box  ctrl space  This would decrease the number of classes in the names box and reduce confusion  if a whole package or jar is totally unimportant for the developer of a high level API  which uses some lower level ones Marvin ,3

451340,Annotation based Validation Framework, The annotation based validation framework plugins and feature   Problem statement   The standard EMF validation seems tightly coupled to the language metmodel and difficult to extend without modifying the  ecore file  Users want to have a more flexible declarative mechanism  The idea could be to learn from Xtext and implement a validation mechanism thIn addition difference to plain Xtext  it would be nice if we could register more than one validator for a given meta model  or even on a project basis   so thThe validation should integrate with the IDE  e g  setting error log problem markers when editing or saving  as well with an API  e g  being able to access errors on a given resource programmatically after before a transformation workflow step     Proposed solution   A check based validation framework is attached  The framework follows the same principle of the existing check based framework of Xtext  as it uses  Chek annotated methods for validating model objects  The framework externalizes constraint categories as well as error warning info constants such as severity  message  comments  etc  into an external model  check catalog  In order to guarantee backward compatibility with existing validators  and handle the contribution of other types of validators  a DispatchingValidator is also introduced  This validator is a composition of all the validators assigned to a given package  it should be the entry point for validation  It simply delegates validation to all the existing validators and its returned validation status is the logical  and  of the returned validation status of all the delegations  During this process diagnostics are chained following the delegation order  and the resulting diagnostic is the aggregation of all the delegates  diagnostics To be able to handle the management of validators  a CheckValidationRegistry singleton is introduced  This registry wraps the standard EValidator Registry singleton of EMF and provides utility methods to handle registration and add remove delegates  ,3

316139,NPE when using a qualified Id for the ConstraintProviders extension, modified org eclipse emf validation examples general to reproduce the problemIf you specify a qualified Id in the definition of a ConstraintProvider extension  there is a NullPointerException in JavaConstraintParser After digging a little with the debugger I pinpointed the problem to method JavaConstraintParser parseConstraint   which uses IExtension getNamespaceIdentifier   of the declaring extension as the Id of the bundle  used to load the AbstractModelConstraint class  In the case of a qualified Ids  the namespace identifier is different than the bundle Id The workaround is simple  change the ID to use the plugin Id as name space  or use simple  non qualified  Ids in the ConstraintProviders definition However  it seems to me th I think you should instead use IConfigurationElement getContributor to get the bundleID  see the following quote from the documentation of the deprecated method IConfigurationElement getNamespace lt quote gt As namespace is no longer restricted to the contributor name  use   link  getNamespaceIdentifier    to obtain namespace name or   link  getContributor    to get the name of the contributor of this registry element In the past namespace was dictated by the name of the bundle  If bundle  lt code gt org abc lt  code gt  contributed registry element with Id of  lt code gt MyId lt  code gt   the namespace of the element was always set to  lt code gt org abc lt  code gt   producing the qualified name of  lt code gt org abc MyId lt  code gt  The namespace used to be the same as the bundle name  As a result  the   link  getNamespace    method was used both to obtain the name of the bundle and to obtain the namespace of a registry element Since 3 2  the extension registry allows elements to specify qualified name  The extension point of the plug in  lt code gt org abc lt  code gt  could specify  lt code gt org zzz MyExtPoint lt  code gt  as an Id  In this case  namespace name is  lt code gt org zzz lt  code gt   but the contributor name is  lt code gt org abc lt  code gt   The use of a simple Id is still a preferred way  Whenever possible  specify only the simple Id and let runtime take care of the rest  If your code used the   link  getNamespace    to obtain the name of the contributing bundle  use   link  getContributor     The typical usage pattern here is to find a bundle name to obtain some information from the corresponding OSGi bundle  For example  deducing the file locationspecified as a relative path to the bundle install location would fall into this group If your code used the   link  getNamespace    to obtain the namespace of the registry element  use   link  getNamespaceIdentifier     Typically  this is the case when code is trying to process registry elements belonging to some logical group  For example  processing notifications for all elements belonging to the  lt code gt org abc lt  code gt  namespace would fall into this category  lt  quote gt  The same assumption regarding the bundleId is done at several other places in the framework  particularly in class XmlConstraintDescriptorI attach a modified version of org eclipse emf validation examples general to reproduce the problem  All the modifications are in the plugin xml file  The important modification is specifying a qualified Id for the ConstraintProviders extension defintion  There is a another subtle difference in the file plugin xml w r t the original  the header of the file specifies an eclipse version greater than 3 2  lt  eclipse version  3 4   gt   Otherwise  the platform considers thI have tested in Galileo EMF 2 5 Validation 1 3 and also in Helios EMF 2 6 Validation 1 4  an although the NPE happens in different places the error is present  ,3

163439, Project Sets  Import Team Project Set should provide ability to specify project location, For working with EMF GMF EMFT UML2 XSD as CVS projects I need to check out more than 160 projects   So I thought this ability to import and export a team project set would be very useful to avoid having to select 160 projects each time I start a new workbench   Normally  in order to provide a self hosting bootstrapped environment  when I check out the CVS projects  I locate them in the actual plugins directory of the Eclipse I am running   The Check Out As dialog lets me specify where all the projects go  so thSo the feature request it so provide the same  Select project location  page for the  Import Team Project Set  wizard and appears in the  Check Out As  wizard  ,5

24725, Presentations  Provide API for querying for physical view bounds, In some cases it would be nice to have an API for finding which view is to the left  right  north  south position of a certain other view   The information seem to be used when dragging and dropping views in order to render the correct arrows and dropping the views correctly I have not been able to find the physical view bounds through the API  only by down casting views to their concrete class and then find their  viewpart  s window boundaries   not a good thing   My particular use case is for providing  geographical  navigation actions  so the user can just navigate in the direction of the view instead of through Ctrl F7 Ctrl F6 like functionallity  ,5
56423, MPE  MultiPageSelectionProvider should take the editor into acount, MultiPageSelectionProvider currently assumes that only nested editors can provide selections  This is unfortunate for FormEditor  where pages contributed as controls can also be selection source  The proposed fix is to check the active nested editor first  If the result is null  go to the multi page editor site itself and see if it has a selection provider For example public ISelection getSelection    IEditorPart activeEditor   multiPageEditor getActiveEditor   if  activeEditor    null   ISelectionProvider selectionProvider   activeEditor getSite   getSelectionProvider   if  selectionProvider    null return selectionProvider getSelection    return null  should be rewritten to bepublic ISelection getSelection    IEditorPart activeEditor   multiPageEditor getActiveEditor   if  activeEditor    null   ISelectionProvider selectionProvider   activeEditor getSite   getSelectionProvider   if  selectionProvider    null return selectionProvider getSelection            else            ISelectionProvider selectionProvider   multiPageEditor getSite   getSelectionProvider                   if  selectionProvider    null                         return selectionProvider getSelection            return null  I didn t check other classes similar to this one  but in general  MultiPageEditorPart and its site should be given a try if active nested editor is not found  ,5

109835, WorkbenchParts  Link smooth sash resizing to the  Enable animations  preference, Currently  the Eclipse UI always uses the SMOOTH style for its sashes   Thisfeature is not always desirable  especially on slower machines There is already a preference in the Appearance tab called  Enable animations   It seems logical to me to have this behaviour linked to this preference   Thisseems easy to hook up  although it only takes full effect when you restart Eclipse  ,5

37154, Team  Support for subversion, One of my biggest gripes with CVS is the lack of directory metadata Subversion is a version control system which is very similar to CVS  except ittries to fix a number of the CVS shortcomings such as the lack of directorymetadata  The CVS integration in eclipse is one of the best CVS client implementations Ihave seen  and I would love to have an eclipse subversion integration thatworked as well as the CVS one Since there is a fair amount of overlap in behavior between CVS and subversion it probably wouldn t be that hard to rework the cvs plugins to add support forsubversion   Obviously  this would be a lot easier for the people that wrote thecvs plugins than for someone starting from scratch that had to learn theexisting code  ,5
