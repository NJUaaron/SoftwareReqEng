57183, syntax highlighting  Method sub types, I came up with this idea when I was testing a new IDE for Dark Basic   The Developer liked it so much he decided he wanted to do it  but in his case he had to learn more C   in order to rebuild his IDE to do it   Hopefully my suggestion would not be nearly as difficult for Eclipse Java Dark Basic is a Game Development language that is Procedural based  not object   As such it has slew  after slew of commands  keywords    There are so many that a few individuals in the DB community have made the recommendation of creating a Keywords2  Keywords3  etc       to keep 3 4 of your code from all looking like the same color  usually Bold Blue  do to all the keywords undergoing the same syntax Highlighting   But I had an idea that I think made a bit more sense   Instead of creating a few extra Keywords just to offload the main Keyword  in this case Keywords1  or the original set of command assigned to  Keyword     Why not create Keyword groups  say like 10 20 of them   You would then apply your syntax style  highlighting  and color to the group   Then you would assign basic keyword types to these groups EX   3D commands would be assigned to Keyword group1  Network and FTP commands to group2  Animation to group 3  and so on The basic concept was to get similar or  like  commands  such as the dozen or so network and FTP commands  in one Keyword group  and that group would be assigned a specific syntax style  highlight  color  etc       to make all those commands appear in your code with the same syntax highlighting and style Since Java keywords are not the center of action of the object  rather the methods are  I was thinking the same could also apply to Java code but based on the Methods  not the keywords   For example Keyword Group 1    gt  java io  java nio  All the Input Output methods Keyword Group 2    gt  java awt  All the 2D methods Keyword Group 3    gt  javax swing  All the 3D methods Keyword Group 4    gt  java net  All the Networking methods etc      Like my suggestion in Dark Basic  this will give the various methods of one basic type or another  its own distinct look  making it more noticeable and stand out better EX   Scanning through you code for your Network methods  are easier when you know all networking methods are Bold Gold  as apposed to the methods of Input Output which are bold green Brad ,3

219887, Viewers  ISelectionProvider events not triggered by TableViewer setItemCount  , Tested under 3 3 1 1 When using an SWT VIRTUAL style Table with a TableViewer and ILazyContentProvider  the usage pattern recommended in the JavaDoc is for the content provider to call TableViewer setItemCount   during updateElement    when necessary   This sequence is triggered by TableViewer setInput   and TableViewer refresh   If the TableViewer has selected elements  and one or more of these elements is no longer present after the refresh    the TableViewer should fire ISelectionChangedListener selectionChanged   with the updated selection   The trivial case is setItemCount 0   which should fire an event with StructuredSelection EMPTY In fact  no event is fired I have traced this to a faulty assumption in the implementation of StructuredViewer preservingSelection     This is the code    send out notification if old and new differISelection newSelection   getSelection   if   newSelection equals oldSelection        handleInvalidSelection oldSelection  newSelection   The problem is thAt some point after the UI thread finishes processing the current event and the main event pump loops again  Windows will attempt to redraw the Table  which will trigger SWT SetData   gt  ILazyContentProvider updateElement     gt  TableViewer setItemCount     At this point  we should expect Windows to notify us thIt s unclear to me whether this is a JFace or an SWT bug   I suspect SWT is the problem  but I have only observed the effects via JFace API   Perhaps Table setItemCount   needs to explicitly fire selection events in this case  since Windows is failing us here   Perhaps TableViewer setItemCount   needs to verify the selection state and fire the events  ,3
434020,When using configuro  please provide linker opt file for TI and GCC compilers, When I use configuro in my build flow  there is no support for adding the necessary linker options to the linker command line  It falls to me to inspect the target for linker options and to add them to my makefile  It would be nice if configuro would generate a linker opt file which I could then use to add the necessary options to my linker command  Since configuro is given the target  it has access to all the necessary options This came about because a customer was using configuro but omitted some linker options which caused his link to fail Thanks Ramsey ,3

385287,Consider improving changing wait feedback during ajax requests, Currently the UI will give no immediate feedback th In my opinion this is not ideal because 1  Often the rendering of the response takes longer than the request itself  So the time until the UI changes after a user interaction may well be over 500ms without any feedback 2  If a request really takes a long time  lets say more than 3 seconds   the user can continue to interact with the UI  which he will becauser users are inpatient  As a result then next request may contain several events UI updates  and all potentially based on an outdated UI state 3  The wait cursor is not visible on tablets I would suggest to always change the cursor to a wait icon immediately   So it may appear to ficker a bit sometimes  i would not consider this a problem   Alternatively  it could change the cursor if the response contains more than a certain number of operations  predicting a longer time for rendering Also  i think we should consider to show a wait popup  with an document overlay  if the request runs longer than 3 5 seconds  This also happens in windows 7 if an application becomes unresponsive  Usually this should never be seen by the user  as the application developer should use UI callback for operations thSince the code for much of this is already in place  the changes would be relatively small On a related note  certain widgets could show some kind of wait hint if they  know  th Other places where this could done is when tree items are resolved or when switching in a tabfolder  ,3

161799, Undo    consider more aggressively merging CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation into the undoable operation, When the undoable operations CopyResourcesOperation and MoveResourcesOperation were developed  the working assumption was thCopyFilesAndFoldersOperation provides API for not only copying  and moving  files and folders in the workspace  but also for importing files from the file system  and validating target locations for move  copy  and import operations A more aggressive approach might be to attempt to deprecate the CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation  and its subclass MoveFilesAndFoldersOperation  and move all of the existing logic into the undoable operations   This would require additional API methods on the undoable operations for performing imports and validating destinations without actually doing any work  ,5
165483, Workbench  Seperation of settings, While I really like eclipse as an IDE it s often hard to use in shared source environments IMHO The problem is thThe best way to implement this would be to have data for all users in one database  single file  which then can be uploaded e g  to SVN  There s another database for every user  which is put beside the global one  So settings like e g  compile options for managed projects are shared  while every user can have his own settings for e g  the UI or plugin options There s another database which holds the  system  settings  e g  proxy settings or other values which aren t workspace dependant This way is implemented in MSVC and IMHO it s a very nice design  I hope this could be introduced in eclipse as well  ,5
