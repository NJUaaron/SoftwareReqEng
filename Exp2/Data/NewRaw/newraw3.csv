406170,JDT causes JAR locking on Windows systems  must exit eclipse to force file handle close  to allow deletion of files , JDT appears to be causing JAR locking on Windows  JAR locking  is where a file on a window file system has one or more file handles open   This stops Windows from allowing the file to be deleted   This does not occur on Unix systems as those systems allow a file unlink   when if a file handle is open to it JDT causes JAR locking on Windows systems  must exit eclipse to force file handle close  to allow deletion of files JDT need to have a button in preferences to force it to close all possible file handles   My guess is thThe scenario is thIt appears thThis means thEven closing the project in Eclipse does not force the open file handles to be closed by Eclipse  even though those files are inside thThe only way to be able to remove these files is to Exit Eclipse Once Eclipse is shutdown you can either manually delete the JARs with your operating system UI or command line   Or if you disabled auto build before Exiting eclipse 80  of the time you can use Eclipse UI to delete the JAR files or run  mvn clean  successfully Obviously having to Exit Eclipse in order to continue working is a major productivity destroyer An example is a WAR project where often 5 JARs out of 40 JARs get locked   These 5 JARs often have the Jar File icon next to them when shown in project explorer  while the rest of the standard file icon  no idea wh ,3

496563,Do not add parentheses when passing a function pointer as argument, I would have a suggestion for content assist auto complete Let s say I have this function pointer type   typedef void   callback type   int a  double b  char c  and function foo takes one of these as a parameter   void foo callback type func  and bar implements that signature   void bar  int a  double b  char c             and I want to pass bar to foo like this   foo  bar  i can type up to this point   foo  band then use content assist  ctrl space  to auto complete bar  well  that s abad example since it s a short name  but imagine it s a reaaally long name   WhenI select bar in the content assist drop down  CDT autocompletes as if I wanted tocall bar at this point   foo  bar  a  b  c but it s not the case  I just want to pass it as a pointer  so I d like if it did   foo  barI then have to remove the parentheses and their content   When working frequentlywith callbacks function pointers  it becomes a bit annoying   Could CDT be smarter so that under certain conditions  it doesn t add the parentheses For example  if the type of the function selected in the menu  bar  matches preciselythe type expected at this point  which foo accepts   then there is a good chance thatwe don t actually want to call the function  but pass it as a function pointer   Idon t really know how CDT works internally  but I guess thFor example  the AST might not include the necessary info at this point  since thestatement is not syntactically correct yet  so it might be hard to detect that theuser is typing foo s first parameter  ,3

340147,Annoying click sound when closing editors   Windows only , Build Identifier  In the Windows platform  when you use a DLTK based editor and then close it  you hear one or two browser click sounds  This problem will happen if a DLTK popup has been opened while using the editor  but otherwise there will be no click sound  The click sound is the same as the Internet Explorer click sound I investigated this a bit further  and it seem it is due to DLTK usage of the Browser control in BrowserInformationControl  Typically  one or two BrowserInformationControl s are created per editor instance  when hover popups appear  They will only be disposed when the editor is closed  and that s when the click sound is heard I compared DLTK s BrowserInformationControl with JFace s BrowserInformationControl  and it seems the difference might be due to this code    browser setJavascriptEnabled false  which is present in JFace but not in DLTK  I tried thjava view co   and it does seem to make the browser close click sound disappear  although I m not sure why  probably just some IE strangeness Reproducible  AlwaysSteps to Reproduce 1  open a DLTK based editor of any DLTK IDE2  make a documentation hover popup appear3  close the editor ,3

485400,Provide an API to get an attribute value for a given entity instance, I don t know if this is the right place for such a request  but since EclipseLink is the JPA Reference Implementation I hope It would be VERY helpful if the JPA metamodel supported a way to get an attribute value given the javax persistence metamodel Attribute lt X  Y gt  instance and an actual instance of the entity th Something like Y getValue X entityInstance  In case of the canonical metamodel  the implementation might even be generated  since X type is known   otherwise a generic reflection based implementation might be provided by the JPA implementation Right now  I have to provide this by myself  A proof of concept for the SingularAttribute case private static  lt E  A gt  A getAttributeValue final E entity final SingularAttribute lt   super E  A gt  attribute     try      final Member member   attribute getJavaMember       if  member instanceof Method          SuppressWarnings  unchecked        final A result    A    Method  member  invoke entity        return result       else if  member instanceof Field          SuppressWarnings  unchecked        final A result    A    Field  member  get entity        else        throw new IllegalArgumentException            unexpected Java member type  expecting Method or Field  found               member      catch  final Exception e        throw new RuntimeException e      There are two problems though   in case of Field  an access through the getter  instead of a direct access through the field itself  would respect object encapsulation an hence would be preferable  it s not a big problem to enhance the above code to try getter access before direct field access in the  member instanceof Field  case  though   this is much harder  instead  I m experiencing that for related entities the member is a Method but in case of statically weaved classes this Method is not my declared method  but rather an internal EclipseLink Weaver generated method that does not return the actual value  but rather a ValueHolder for thatThis is a problem because I would need to unwrap the value holder and I couldn t yet find a proper way to do thSo  if the JPA API provided such a feature  it would be very helpful when using the metamodel to perform generic processing over entities Meanwhile  any suggestion to solve the  ValueHolder  problem would be appreciated  ,3

282542,Stronger support for the bundle pooling,  I was recently discussing with a friend of mine the problem of multiple eclipse installations could be solved by using bundle pooling and custom dynamic bootstrapping of eclipse with appropriate profile With bundle pooling one could have the entire world of eclipse plug ins in a single bundle pool but only bootstrap with those enabled thIf done right  the launcher could for example in addition to selecting your workspace ask you to choose your  eclipse profile   and possibly remember to bind the profile to the workspace  This way we would not need to install multiple instances of Eclipse and still gain the benefits of having separate IDE configurations for  Java  vs  J2EE  vs  Modeling  development   As a possible user of this feature I envision th The prompt should allow us to create a brand new profile or use the default one  based on the downloaded package   or allow selecting from a set of preconfigured profiles The way I see this  the  default  bundle pool would be hosted If this idea has any merit  I am more than happy to elaborate more on the possible use cases and usage scenarios  ,3

518724,ProxyServlet DispatchTargets silently adds trailing slash to requests to ContextRoot without trailing slash, We re running Equinox in a Servlet Container using the servlet bridge  The application has a Vaadin Web UI  Vaadin checks the request URI  if it leads to    lt context root gt   without trailing slash  it redirects to    lt context root gt     thus avoiding problems with a wrong request URI down the line Recently  we updated to Neon  updating org eclipse equinox http servlet from 1 2 1 to 1 3 1  This changed the way the request is proxied In 1 2 1  HttpServletRequestBuilderWrapperImpl did not override getRequestURU   and just returned the requestUri of the wrapped request In 1 3 1  instead the HttpServletRequestWrapperImpl is used  which returns DispatchTargets getRequestURI    This uses the path info of the incoming request  If the path info is null      is used  which changes to the proxied request to    lt context root gt   to    lt context root gt     Vaadin will no longer redirect  and the UI subsequently does not work  because the actual request URI is still    lt context root gt   Our expectation is the following in the case that the path info is null   The DispatchTargets are resolved as if the path info were      as before   The request uri stays the same as in the incoming request ,3

102726,Using text size to make code more readable, Statically typed languages  such as Java  force one to have a lot of noise in the code just to keep the compiler happy  When reading the code  variable type declarations  typecasts  method return types  visibilities etc  often make the reading of the code very difficult  This is something I love e g  in Ruby   the code is very readable as there is very little noise So  I came up with an idea  IDE could be of help in reducing the noise  It would be possible to use font sizes to make the code appear so that it is easier to read  The kind of stuff I mentioned above would be in a smaller font  possibly even a different font  Scite editor uses this and having e g  comments in different font enhances the readability incredibly  thus making the reading easier    The solution should be wholly configurable  so the user could select which of the following  and possibly others   are  diminished    method return types  method visibilities  method argument types  types in variable declarations  typecastsetc  It should also be configurable what font size to use for the diminished things  possibly stating size relative to the editor font size  e g   4  I tried it out quickly in Word and I find it very appealing  please see the attached word doc The advantage of this approach is that you can still see the  noisy  elements  but it is easier to ignore them  Also  sometimes you might want to e g  see the visibilities of the methods with no  diminishing   then you could choose to do so  ,5
