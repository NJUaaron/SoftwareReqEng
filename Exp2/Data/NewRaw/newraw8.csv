86818,Consider extending type pattern matching to support hasmethod    hasfield  , Consider the use cases  1  every type th type  orannotation   should have a mixin interface used by the aspect to manage thatproperty  From Michael Nascimento    I wanted to introduce a mixin in any class containing a method with acertain annotation  This is the case for genesis     still using AW 1 1  going to migrate toAW 2 0 next week   CommandResolver interface and its defaultimplementation  The idea is any class that had a method annotated with Remotable  Transactional had this interface introduced in order tosupport two core genesis features  transparent remoting andtransactional support  2  Any type defining a method setFoo Foo  should have a Foo instance DI d intoit after it is initialised Both of these use cases are easily dealt with by extending AspectJ s typepattern language to support hasfield   and hasmethod   type pattern  designators   The syntax would be hasfield AnnotationPattern  FieldTypePattern NamePattern hasmethod AnnotationPattern  ReturnTypePattern NamePattern TypePatternList  Use case 1 above is now addressed by declare parents  hasfield  SomeAnnotation      implements MyMixin Use case 2 is addressed by after Object obj  returning   execution hasmethod void setFoo Foo   new       amp  amp this obj         call setFoo on  this  reflectively              Note  this would be the first time we have introduced type pattern designators It might make sense to do this at the same time as supporting a type pattern language    i e  add composition  have it already  and abstraction to typepatterns  This would be a much bigger change of course  It would require a meansto declare named type patterns  just as we declare pointcuts today   to composetype patterns  we already have this   and to use a named type pattern in placeof an anonymous type pattern at any point in the AspectJ grammar that a typepattern is accepted For example aspect Foo       tpatterns have visiblity just like pointcuts  may be declared in classes  private tpattern requiresMixinSupport      hasmethod  Remotable               hasmethod  Transactional                 need some way to indicate type pattern name rather than type name  a      prefix char is the obvious   most have meanings th     can t use    which I prefer  because it is legal in Java identifiers  declare parents   amp requiresMixinSupport implements MyMixin    ,2

485220, General  Releng  Provide a more modular architecture   amp  builds  for Papyrus, In order to get faster feedback on Gerrit builds  we need to build smaller components  However  the current structure does not properly support this  due to several issues   Not all plug ins properly implement the Papyrus architecture  e g  some infra plug ins depend on UML or GMF   The build is split into 4 units  Main  Main Tests  Extra  Extra Tests   We should get more smaller units  e g  Infra Core  Views  Diagrams  Tables  UML Diagrams  UML Tables   The tests should be closer to the tested components  to be able to run tests when building tested components  Currently we can only run  Main Tests  or  Extra Tests   The lack of clear API doesn t provide enough confidence when changing core components  so we need to rebuild retest everything to ensure that we don t break anyoneSome components that could be improved  This list is not exhaustive    Extract the ServicesRegistry outside infra core  Or  separate Services from Sash Editor   This  core  plug in includes both UI Components  Sash Editor  and core service management  Services ServiceRegistry   Most plug in depend on it for Services  but end up with a strong UI dependency  ModelExplorer  UI Trees in general   Semantic Model  amp  Content provider  Currently  the only abstraction we have for a  Semantic Model  is the IModel interface UmlModel implementation  When we want to retrieve the  Semantic Model  of Papyrus  And content provider   we need to depend on uml tools   Palette  The palette framework has a dependency to UML to support profiles  This means thpalette depends on UML although it simply contributes a Post Action for the generic palette framework   Remove the strong dependency on the   uml file extension  which makes it impossible to support normative XMI in Papyrus  OMG XMI URIs  properly supported by Eclipse UML   This extension is used in many places in PapyrusThis task is not related to the build issue but still makes sense for a more modular architecture  It is also probably more complex    Diagram Runtime  GMF is split between  GMF Runtime  and  GMF Diagram UI   The first one doesn t depend on GEF   We don t do this distinction in Papyrus  which means th We should have a clearer separation of the Runtime and UI components for the diagrams ,2

481272,Discovered a number of bugs in Performance  display  functions, Move of these are related to hard to find hardcoded assumptions about build names  Namely  th Plus  apparently  it was assume R builds were named with two dates  such as R3 5 200510101000 200510101000  I can find no instances of builds named with underscores on archives site  and none th My hope is there is not something that  changes format  upon putting into the database  Plus  there were some hard coded values th My initial fix will fix many of those assumptions  but  admit  I have fixed  for now  by still using hard coded values             Plus  there were lots of places where exceptions were ignored or invalid  input parameters  were being ignored  I have increased the error checking           I will say  though  th            My strategy is to fix some of these obvious problems  and  reset  the data base to empty  which will make it easier to figure out if  wrong build  is used when running a  reference test  or if it is being miscoded  I addition  may find other cases of hard coding assumptions  ,2

215007,Widget notifyListeners int  Event  should catch runtime Exceptions when looping through the listeners, Build ID   M20070921 1145Steps To Reproduce 1  Put a couple of listeners  any kind  on a widget2  One of the listeners throws an arbitrary RuntimeException  eg  NPE 3  listeners subsequently called in the loop  EventTable  are not called  More information The listener calls not being safeguarded has also severe consequences for any caller of Display readAndDispatch   since the listeners RuntimeException travels outside without being wrapped in a SWTException  If a runtime exception is happening in a runnable running a Display syncExec or Display asyncExec it comes wrapped in a SWTException  Therefore callers of Display readAndDispatch   might not expect thWe had this problem when setting up for UI tests  Since the PDE JUnit tests are run in the UI thread we have to fork out to a separate tests with an own test suite in order to not block the test run with modal dialogs being opened  Our test suite forks the test run into a separate test  from the UI thread  and issues then a Display readAndDispatch   loop until a flag indicates the test run being finished  The  expected  SWTException had been caught in the waiting loop but not a RuntimeExcpetion which might easily be propagated through from a listener  This lead to a premature death of the WorkbenchTestable thread and the IDE subsequently not being shut down  which caused severe problems in test run nightly  Also the bug was very hard to find since  as the RuntimeException was not caught and or logged in the loop  it was not apparent thI think the following behaviour would be desired 1  Catching any RuntimeException from listeners for each individually while looping through the listeners 2  Wrap the caught exception into a SWTException  like it is done for Runnables in a Display syncExec  and throw after ALL listeners are being notified  This also prevents the UI from undesired behaviour if one of the players in the game is playing false  ,3

291333,Make UI and headless app live together, Equinox does a gre If you create your own ant tasks  and try to run them  you will meet for sure invalid thread access  because equinox will start UI plugins UI and headless modes are quite abstract concepts which seems to be orthogonal  and completely transparent  to Equinox There is a couple of ways to solve this situation  1  Independent plug ins sets for each application in one product       it is clear which plug in will be run with which application     application diagnosis will be easy     P2 hell seems to be NOGO you install one plug in  for which application   2  Skipping UI plug ins in headless mode     no good way to know if the plug in is UI one     equinox will depend  optionally  on SWT JFace  to check if display is present    NOGO      fast to implement 3  Introducing application states    An application could declare states and made them available to Equinox  Equinox could then check other plug in state requirements  and load them if state requirement is satisfied   We could f e  have UI state declared in SDK app  and requires UI in each UI plugin  ,3
345503,Reconsider patch update policy for EPP Packages, Here s a new one for you     a bug that causes something good to happen     While I ve seen this on Java EE IDE  I suspect related to  and therefore might be a problem for all of the  recreated  packages  We in WTP are preparing yet another maintenance release for Helios  post SR2  so I was testing to make sure it installed on Helios SR2 package  A  From scratch scenario  Extracted Java EE package  added our new maintenance release site to  available software sites   because its not released yet  not in our already supplied software site      assuming after release  and after webtools composite repo is updated  this bug would appear even without adding anything to software sites   then I clicked  udpate software  expecting it to tell me there was not any  but instead  I got updates  For all of the new WTP stuff      plus those 2 0301 features mentioned in   namely  the 2 EPP features are  Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers 1 3 2 20110301 1807andJava EE IDE Feature 1 3 2 20110301 1807  org eclipse epp package jee feature feature groupB  From mini update scenerio  As above  starting fresh  I extracted the Helios SR2 package  did not add webtools repo  yet  and did  update   As expected from   I was offered to update those two EPP packages     and did  Now my install is current to  Helios SR2b   so to speak  And  then  I added the new webtools maintenance software site  And now when I pressed  update   I got  no updates found      as I originally expected  So  the  good thing  I joked about  While in 95  of the cases this is a good thing  there might be cases where users update their  Helios SR2 package  in ways th Not to mention  it will appear inconsistent to users     one developer may be automatically offered the udpates     their buddy developer may not     and they ll spend hours trying to figure out what s wrong    In th Even worse  6 months from now     a user may be hitting one of the 120 bugs we fixed in WTP 3 2 4  while their buddy is not  and in both cases  from their point of view  months ago we just installed Helios SR2 and applied all available updates  why a bug in one  and not the other   So     lots of oddities will be encountered     so  I thought I should document this bug  Not sure it can be  fixed  per se   I ve no idea why the WTP maintenance updates would get  sucked in  in the above  from scratch  scenario     just because there are some minor  SR2 equivalent EPP features available     but sounds like a bug somewhere  My guess would be  EPP meta data  but could be in p2 mechanisms  I guess  ,3
