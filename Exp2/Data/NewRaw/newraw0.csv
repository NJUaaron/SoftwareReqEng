550836,Provide a warning for always true or never true numeric literal conditions, Basically if you have a condition similar to the one above   e g  byte b  lt 128 or byte b  gt  128 we could add a warning thIt doesn t necessarily need to be bounded to the byte type but can be extended for other numericals also  ,3
122475,Extensionpoint for additional SuppressWarnings tokens, The Argus Codewatch project  arguscodewatch sourceforge net  adds additional warnings and errors to the Eclipse Java compiler  It also uses the  SuppressWarnings annotation to suppress the warnings  However  if in Eclipse the compiler option  Unhandled warning token in   SuppressWarnings   is set to warning  our self defined warnings will be flagged  The current workaround is suppressing the warning for unhandled warning tokens We propose to add a new Extension Point for declaring new warning tokens  Possibly  this Extension Point also defines a problemid to enable the UI to create a quickfix for suppressing the warning Implementing this feature enables plug in developers to add additional compiler checks resulting  hopefully  in better Java code  ,3

415563,Move generic parts of JDT to  D LTK  , This is not a feature request per se  but just an idea thAs per blogs and comments on    it appears thDLTK seems to provide the right level of abstraction for any language  including Java  So it would make sense to re write JDT on top of DLTK so there would be a better factorization of everything related to programming language tools With that  we can expect a high quality on DLTK  which would benefit from feedback from its various usage  which would lead to high quality for all programming language tools  ,3

185512,collapsable  log statements, I m currently in a debate with a collegue on logging  I d love to see more logging statements in my code to be able to pinpoint errors and bugs faster just be cranking up the loglevel of a class or package  On the other hand the logging levels do clutter up your code and it makes it harder to view Wouldnt it be nice if the IDE can also show your logstatements depending of logattribute of the file  A bit the same as hiding your import statements but than dependent of an changeable loglevel attribute so lets say my code is full of logging stmts like this final String methodName    getIndexSelectItems    if  logger isTraceEnabled         logger trace LogUtils getLogMessage BusinessLayerConstants VERSION         methodName   starting      or if  logger isInfoEnabled         logger info LogUtils getLogMessage BusinessLayerConstants VERSION         methodName   info     orlogger error LogUtils getLogMessage BusinessLayerConstants VERSION         methodName   error    Setting the loglevel attribute in the IDE to trace would show all the above logging statements  Settting the loglevel attribute in the IDE to error would only show the last log statement For me it would mean a very welcome feature regards Jeroen  ,3

114546,Eclipse project documentation plug ins need their own features, In order to accomplish two goals of the 3 2 release  the Eclipse Project documentation plugins need to be moved from the  code  features that currently include them to separate documentation features   The two goals are 1  Enable the update  via update manager  of documentation after the release independently from the  code  features 2  Enable the support  provision of documentation fixes via updates  of translation of the documentation after the 3 2 release date without having to wait until the first maintenance release There needs to be at least one documentation feature for each subproject that included documentation  Platform  JDT  PDE    Ideally  there would be separate features for end user and ISV documentation since some downstream products only want the end user documentation and it is common industry practice to only translate end user documentation and not ISV documentation   In addition  the ISV documentation features should only be contained in the SDK packages on the download site and not the runtime packages It was recommend that this enhancement request start in the Releng component since this is where feature   packaging changes are often implemented  ,3

321963, Discovery  DNS SD  Automatically deregister services when TTL expires,  Internet Draft           Dynamic DNS Update Leases      10th August 20061  Introduction   Dynamic DNS Update  RFC 2136  allows for a mapping from a persistent   hostname to a dynamic IP address  This capability is particularly   beneficial to mobile hosts  whose IP address may frequently change   with location  However  the mobile nature of such hosts often means   that dynamically updated resource records are often not properly   deleted  Consider  for instance  a mobile user who publishes address   records via dynamic update  If this user unplugs the Ethernet cable   from their laptop  the address record containing stale information   will remain on the server indefinitely    DNS Scavenging  attempts to   address this issue by configuring clients and servers with a preset   refresh interval  however  this approach does not extend to   zero configuration environments in which the client and server are   not under the same administration  An extension to Dynamic Update is   thus required to tell the server to automatically delete resource   records if they are not refreshed after a period of time    0    An alternative is to do this in the provider by using something like a deregister thread  However and implementation following the given spec is greatly superior     0   ,3

re index  it doesn t seem to hit the problem on the same file second time around Full call stack for other threads is attached Since the indexer is effectively dead after this  there is no choice but

77352, misc  Provide  alternate representations  in editor  e g  BigDecimal as if operator overloading, Operator overloading does not look like it will be making its way into the Javaplatform anytime soon    This means that financial math involving BigDecimaltends to look rather messy compared to what it might look like if operatoroverloading was available I think Eclipse has an opportunity to help the comprehension of programs byproviding alternate representations for Java code  syntactical sugar if youwill      Eclipse could identify sections of code that might be more clearlyunderstood with an alternate representation  and then provide a means for usersto switch th  At all times the actual textwritten to disk would be the  canonical Java form    The user could potentiallyedit the code in the alternate form and then know that the correct Java form waswritten to disk  toggling back and forth to understand the relation between whatthey see and whFor example  the user might see    a   b   c rather than   a multiply b  minus c So how would Eclipse know thmultiply is the     operator  Metadata  either Java 5 0 annotations  or in the case of system classes seperate annotation data One of the tough things about C   operator overloading is that it is hard tolook at the code and understand what overloaded operators are called and withwh  This featureaims to tackle that by saying that the actual code on disk is the real deal   exactly wh  It s just the representation in theeditor that can be toggled to show the alternate viewing editing form which maysimplify the comprehension for the reader Anyways  just thought I d share this idea   Thanks for making such a gre ,5

69516, EditorMgmt  Ability to plug in alternative editors  for example GVIM or emacs, I raised this point at a JavaOne eclipse BOF but we never got a chance to talk about it  Here is the idea in full You should be able to plug in an alternative editor rather than using the editor th For example  you should be able to write a plugin th Note that I am not talking about  VI key bindings   which would not add any functionality to eclipse  but rather I am talking about using GVIM as an OLE object within Eclipse via a plugin  gaining access to the full power of the GVIM  or other  software For reference a competing product  the Intellij IDEA IDE  has a plugin that wraps around GVIM as an OLE object  It renders the text within the Intellij window so that all of the smart IDE features still work  syntax highlighting  hyper navigation  mouse overs  etc   but the text buffer itself is actually managed by vim  It is not just a set of keybindings that are VI like  it actually wraps VIM as an OLE object  The plugin forwards the key strokes to the VIM editor  and VIM has support for this kind of use  The feature should not be VIM specific but should enable plugin writers to create plugins for any editor with API bindings That all said I do have to wonder why in this day in age anyone would ever set out to write a new editor  There are a lot of mature  reliable  well known  and widely used editors out there that are all better than the paltry homegrown and necessarily immature editor provided in Eclipse  gvim  emacs  ultraedit  textpad  etc   etc   etc  Allowing eclipse to integrate with the users default preferred editor not only buys you a better editor  it provides for seamless integration with the rest of the platform  and saves you the trouble of having to write one Catching up with the functionality provided by VIM or EMACS or whatnot is a herculean task that will only serve to distract the eclipse team from working on its core values  the smarts about navigating  indexing  cross referencing  refactoring  debugging  and generally building software  ,5

383365,consider keeping a copy of pre reqs used in our builds,   As documented there and related bugs there were a lot of changes in ECF trying to get meta data right  with least impact on existing clients  But  in the end  for the very final one  it was deemed too late to respin RC4 for this problem  since we were already past our deadline  and it was not considered a  blocking  problem  As a result the version of ECF we used in our release was not the same as the version ECF released  The qualifiers differed  though  content was the same  the metadata in repository changed   The qualifier we used was v20120608 0148 and the qualifier they released was  v20120610 1946  In other words  we could not exactly  rebuild  our release  such as for a hot fix patch  since the versions with v20120608 0148 is now gone   Well  it does exist in our own repository     but to build with it  would take some magic to extract it  into a form acceptable for  prereq      or  update our map files  etc    While I think this is an extremely rare problem  in theory it could be a serious one  don t think it is in this case     but     this bugzilla is about the principle of the thing   Thus  thought I d open this bug to track the consideration of  us  saving a copy of every pre req we use to build our releases   Technically  this could extend to VMs  etc      but  I m mostly concerned about the smaller things here    ,5

76157, IDE  Open Resource   Right click on the directories for each resource could provide actions, I often search for files with a special meaning to Windows but not to Eclipse which Eclipse then delegates to Windows to open   An example is a PNG file where I basically do not want to work with the contents but the directorycontaining the file I therefore type in the file name  and see several folders where this fileexist   i would then like to be able to right click on the folders and be ableto in some way work with the folder   Examples coul dbe   Show file in Navigator   Open folder in Windows or Navigator  Just the  Open with     functionality seen elsewhere  ,5

94061, IDE  unable to move files when others are open, in n0505 I have a simple project and a number of plugin and feature projects in my workspace  I happen to have a dirty feature editor open and am trying to move  drag  a file from one dir to another in the simple project   When I do  I get a dialog saying th  This is strange   the project is in no way related to anything else in the workspace   I should be free to do wh  In any event  what does moving one file have to do with any other file and whether or not it is dirty in an editor If there is some valid reason for this dialog  users should be given the option to just do it anyway   The current dialog offers to turn this checking off competely but  assuming there is a reason for it in the first place  it seems harsh to just turn it off  yes  it happens that I do not want ot save that dirty editor so basically I cannot move the file I need to and have to go and find it in the Explorer and move it there  ,5
99817, Markers  Marker tooltip clipped off screen, This may be multimonitor related  because the behaviour differs depending on which monitor I have eclipse on I have  mon 2  mon 1 Eclipse 3 1RC2 on mon 2  if I hover over a JDT marker for example  the tooltip started off the left of mon  2  and thus I was missing a few words  If I move eclipse to monitor  1 and maximize it  just as it was in mon  2   and repeat  this time the tooltip moves to not span over to monitor  1  iotw it prevents crossing the edge   ,5

224810,Provide way to visualize BIRT s  virtual  data set on tables, BIRT reports appear to include two kinds of data sets  There is the explicit one created in the data explorer  The data set editor provides a very nice preview of the data set results which is wonderful for verifying thBut  BIRT also seems to define a  virtual  data set  VDS  on a table   The VDS has its own column bindings  which must  for the most part  mimic th   The VDS can add per row computed columns in addition to those in the DS   The VDS adds aggregates   The VDS adds column bindings for each data item in the report   The VDS provides implicit grouping  as defined by group levels in the table  All of this adds up to a healthy chunk of additional functionality thIt is this ability to clearly separate presentation and data access thFurther  BIRT allows aggregates  A newbie user might expect these to be available in the corresponding group and or table footer  Are they available elsewhere  One can figure this out by experimentation   Add temporary  dummy  fields into various points in the table to see whRelated to this is the question of whA visualization would answer these questions  especially if the visualization provided some kind of highlighting or labeling to say when each row is active  For example  the first row of the data set might have a label th Note that  even if the VDS were defined implicitly  as requested by other bugs   the preview would still be helpful  The VDS is available to the report   ,5
