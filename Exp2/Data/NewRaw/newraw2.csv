529923, 9  compiler  Revisit patch module semantics,  onwardsCurrently  we allow the   patch module option to be specified on each classpath entry on the build path of a project  but interpret it as being applicable to the project under compilation  This needs to be revisited for several reasons  The   patch module option allows arbitrary artifacts on the file system to be used to add modify contents of an existing module  So  the user could point to a jar and indicate thSimilarly  it would be possible to compile a set of sources  as part of  an existing module using this option  Our implementation today targets the second case  but doesn t really work in either way In addition  1  We should ignore this option on a modular project because this option cannot be used to replace module info classes  But we do not do this validation2  The option can be added several times today  and we can t be sure which one will be in effect  So if several entries specify this option  it would go down to the order in which the entries occur in the classpath file For example  if a project wants to use an external implementation of some classes thMultiple modules can be patched with multiple entries and several entries and can patch a single module in this scenario  It should also be possible to add additional exports or reads to the patched module via the respective options Likewise  it should be possible to compile a project as part of another module using this option  In this case  the patch module option applies to the project under compilation and not to the entries on it s build path  This case should work as if the project defines the said module In both cases  when the   patch module option is present  type package lookup should first consult locations from the patches before consulting the actual module th It should also be possible to combine both cases  I hear Stephan saying why would anyone want to do that       so let s not bother about this for now My argument is that we should rather target the first case because it looks more likely and more useful than the second ,3

367630,Enhancement  Identity Override for optional auto generator strategy in derived concrete entities, Build Identifier  2 3 The context here is how to align JPA capabilities to Java generics  and allow to write clean java codes  Considering JPA coding  I have some preferences      Field mapping over method mapping    Try to use all power of java generics in java model design     Factor and reduce code in generic mapped super classes  for maintenance and safety reasons  All those advantages are lost because of a missing JPA function   Identity generation override capability Lets show it in a simple reduced exampleBaseEntity lt K gt    a generic mapped super class  with a prim key of type K  LongBasedEntity   a concrete derived entity class mapped on  LONG ENTITY  table with  BIGINT  prim key type StringBasedEntity   a concrete derived entity class mapped on  STRING ENTITY  table with  VARCHAR 32   prim key typeSeqBasedEntity   a concrete derived entity class mapped on  SEQ ENTITY  table with  BIGINT  prim key type  But with auto generate sequence values in this case  Sequence Table Auto generator       I want the abstract BaseEntity class to host all common fields and methods    And I want specially to declare the id variable in thFor LongBasedEntity and StringBasedEntity  I can use  AttributeOverride and  AssociationOveride to achieve the mapping to related tables  But for SeqBasedEntity  there is actually no way to override the generation strategy     Because there is noannotation for that  So  I am proposing to add a new annotation    IdOverride generate GeneratedValue      This make sense  because JPA already allow mapping override at the entity class level      So  if you have defined the id in higher level classes  you can just specify generate parameter An example follow  MappedSuperclass public abstract class BaseEntity lt K extends Serializable gt  implements Serializable   private static final long serialVersionUID   1L    Version  Column name    VERSION   protected Integer version    Id  Basic optional   false   Column name    ID   nullable   false  protected K id   protected BaseEntity     super       protected BaseEntity K xid    this id   xid     public K getId     return id     public void setId K xid    this id   xid     Entity  Table name    LONG ENTITY  public abstract class LongBasedEntity extends BaseEntity lt Long gt    private static final long serialVersionUID   1L    Basic optional   false   Column name    ENT TYPE   length   32  private String entType   protected LongBasedEntity     super       protected LongBasedEntity Long id    super id      public String getEntityType     return entType     public void setEntityType String s    this entType   s     Entity  Table name    STRING ENTITY  public abstract class StringBasedEntity extends ManagedEntity lt String gt    private static final long serialVersionUID   1L    Basic optional   false   Column name    ENT TYPE   length   32  private String entType   protected StringBasedEntity     super       protected StringBasedEntity String id    super id      public String getEntityType     return entType     public void setEntityType String s    this entType   s     Entity  Table name    SEQ ENTITY   TableGenerator name  METAINFO GEN   table  SEQUENCE TABLE   pkColumnName  SEQ NAME   valueColumnName  SEQ COUNT   pkColumnValue  METAINFO    IdOverride generate  GeneratedValue strategy GenerationType TABLE  generator  METAINFO GEN   public abstract class SeqBasedEntity extends BaseEntity lt Long gt    private static final long serialVersionUID   1L    Basic optional   false   Column name    ENT TYPE   length   32  private String entType   protected SeqBasedEntity     super       protected SeqBasedEntity Long id    super id      public String getEntityType     return entType     public void setEntityType String s    this entType   s    By using  IdOverride  I can now separate the key generation strategy and the inheritance and data type problems I also thought to use  AttributeOverride with an optional generate parameter    But this will certainly add overhead in existing implementation error tracking  There are many others valuable reasons to add this functionality     But as coding preferences are different from developers  I prefer to let others give their thoughts for this request for enhancement Thanks for taking this problem very seriously because I have tone of codes waiting for refactoring Regards Reproducible  Always ,3

477741,Formatting while typing does not place content inside of braces upon return, Consider this snippet of JS code function foo      doit    If I need to call doit conditionally I can start writing the condition in front of it function foo      if  somecondition     doit    With the vertical bar representing the cursor when I press return at this point I would expect to get this result function foo      if  somecondition         doit       Instead I get this  vertical bar indicating the position of the cursor  function foo      if  somecondition            doit    This is quite annoying since one has the cursor in a place thI m used to the behavior described as  expected  from Eclipse JDT which place content following cursor up to the end of the line inside the braces but keep content on the next line after the closing brace  I think this is more logical and makes it easier to move around code after generating the braces as all existing code is on its own line so moving it up down is quite easy  ,3

291632,Proposal  Eclipse downloadable plugins file format, Develop a new file formIntro  the current plugin installation methods are incomplete   Using the update manager is OK  but users like downloading software  Most people who encounter an interesting plugin will not install it right away  if they won t download it  they will forget about it   The Dropins folder is too tech savvy  We want Eclipse to appeal to a broad range of users  Besides  the installtion using the Dropins has very limited options and if it fails there s no way for the developer to assist in solving the issue  like in a full installer  To solve that  A new Eclipse downloadable file formThe form There are several options as for the contents of this JAR   A URL of an update site  The URL could be in the manifest or in a dedicated resource bundle file  Upon launching the file  Eclipse will automatically add the site and start an installation process  One may think of more advanced options to include other than the URL  e g  the feature name to install  which will transparently select the feature and move on the installation phase   An archived update site  Operates much like the remote installation  but uses the local archive  It would be nice to add an option to check for newer versions One may take this one step further and allow the file to contain a complete OSGi bundle  Upon launching the file  the platform will automatically install the bundle and start it  enabling developers to develop custom installers and plugins which will not require any installation  for example  you want to do something just once  The platform should protect against malicious content  check for code signing and confirm with the user before executing the code  much like it is done today with downloaded content in Windows and OS X Future plugin updates will use the current Eclipse update mechanism  although it could be possible to download a newer version of the plugin and install it in the same easy manner More details in the blog post   ,3
