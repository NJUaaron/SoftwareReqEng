543684, 12  Warn against dubious assignments inside a switch expression, In a new test case I found this X x   new X   x    switch  i   case 1    gt     x   null break x  default   gt  null   While all seems legal  the assignment  x   null  looks very suspicious to me  Will developers realize  that the switch  expression  produces a side effect which will be overwritten by the value of the switch expression itself Change the case block to   x   new X      break null and you have a perfect riddle One reason this program violates quick intuition  the assignment inside the switch expression appears lexically below  perhaps much below  the final assignment of the switch expression s value  so it is very hard to see  thI could imagine different levels of warning   warn against any assignment of an outer local inside a switch expression   only warn when switch expression s value is being assigned to the same variable  further filter to report only situations where the inner assigned value is never readThe above example meets all these criteria  We may either pick one of these levels  or create one warning option with sub options  ,3

222676, compiler  Compiler warning for accidental integer addition in string concatenation expression, While trying to reduce our string footprint  we saw a case where the code   value         9443     service  was replaced with   value         9443     service       NON NLS 1 The result of these expressions are quite different   The first sets value to   9443 service   while the second sets value to  9501 service    This happens because the colon character s integer value is added to 9443  before being concatenated with   service  It would be helpful to have a JDT compiler warning for the case where a character is being added to another character  or a number   Ideally the compiler warning would detect only the case where a character is involved in integer addition  followed by concatenation with a string  but I understand if thA common work around for such as problem is to do the following   value              9443     service       NON NLS 1     NON NLS 2 But this is not ideal  since it introduces yet another string  which also needs to be NON NLS d  ,3

508284,FreeEdit behavior in ComboBoxCellEditor deviates from TextCellEditor,   The free edit mode works now  thank you for the fix  However we now have a minor issue with the behavior of the free edit mode With the free edit mode enabled our users expect the same behavior than with a plain TextCellEditor  This means when the cell is selected and the user starts typing the previous cell value is replaced with the keys pressed  In our setup however  the cell configured with the ComboBoxCellEditor  with free edit mode enabled  switches into edit mode and the cell value is always set to the first entry of the given canonicalValues array  The first key press seems to be discarded and every consecutive key is appended in front of the existing text Is there something we might have overlooked  We are basically using the default ComboBoxCellEditor and passing a fixed list of canonicalValues  of type string   Afterwards we call setFreeEdit true   Thanks again for your fast and capable support  it is very much appreciated  ,3

441264, IDE  New WIKI page with Eclipse feature proposals and the WIKI link attached to the N amp N page of the milestone, The main goal of the solution is to promote the development of the release  When someone during the milestone comes up with the idea about some new  interesting feature for Eclipse then they can provide proper entry to the proposed WIKI  The N amp N however can have some  new feature proposal available  icon and proper link to the WIKI  The feature has to be provided in the installable form from the external site  i e  Eclipse Market or Git Hub  When feature is stable enough and accepted by the users it can be merged to the master Git repository      Additionally the WIKI page and indirectly the N amp N one can contain the link to the Bugzilla or blog where the new feature get deeply discussed  When we agree to go with it we have to figure out the way of filtering the craps th However I think  we can postpone it till a first crap What can we achieve by this solution   incoming release can be earlier announced by the blog entries dedicated to the new features and it can encourage the new people from the Community for helping with the development of the new release as well as the users for switching to Eclipse as the primary IDE or RCP platform  new interesting architectural design changes can be proposed with the features  It will be real prove of concept and not only  raw  idea sent via e mail  some really strong Eclipse developers consultants can find the idea interesting and help with development of the new release  during implementation of the new feature you have to quite often fix some defects that block the feature or get exposed by it  what indirectly improves the quality of Eclipse  current solution   announcing the new ideas by mailing list   is not sufficient in my opinion  Some ideas finish with several discussion e mails  Even when something get implemented it can be forgotten in the moment  Having the persisted list with the feature proposals on WIKI that is connected to N amp N page  better visible than the mailing list archive  seems to be better solution in my opinionPlease let me know what do you think about the proposal Daniel ,3

469961,Traditional Memory Rendering should allow to narrow scrollable area for an easier positioning using scrollbar slider, Traditional Memory Rendering defines the scroll range to cover the whole addressable memory range which for a standard 32bit architecture would mean with a single mouse drag to move memory view to display any of 2 147 483 647 lines of scroll With this amount of total lines to scroll  scrollbar slider is not quite usable for positioning memory view to desired location  or even close to it   as any minor mouse movement will move the visible address by tenths of megabytes  I propose to address this in a similar way as platform hex rendering does for dynamic loading mode  i e  an workspace preference to specify number of lines for scrolling  IMHO  a default  100 lines is quite reasonable  Once user scrolls close to top bottom the scroll area will be re positioned  ,3

443454,Ability to generate IDEF0 style diagams, Currently epf can only generate activity diagrams with control flow  specifying a specific order of execution When defining a process model for many projects it is often more useful to only show the information flow between activities  The control flow will be added after tailoring the model for a specific project for example The activity input ouput can be derived from the contained tasks  but is should also be possible to define activity input ouput without going into the detail of tasks Epf should support information flow diagrams  similar to IDEF0 diagrams  Tne connectors between activities represent information flow  ,3

312831,Restart after update of launcher can fail, If you are running with the vm in a seperate process   vm java exe  instead of in process with JNI  then we will fail to restart after a p2 update if the launcher jar was updated to a new version and the old jar has already been removed This is because in this situation  vm in separate process from the eclipse exe   the  ini file is not re read for the restart   The launcher supports 2 restart codes 23   restart  with the same command24   relaunch  with a different commandHistorically   restart  just restarts the java process with the same command and without re reading the launcher ini   With the advent of JNI launcher  we actually need to shutdown the eclipse process itself  so the restart does re read the launcher ini in thWe are currently using Workbench restart    which I believe is a  restart  with exit code 23 One possibility would be to do a  relaunch  and modify the command line  see org eclipse ui ide OpenWorkspaceAction restart for an example of this  ,3

80226, Contributions  dynamic  MenuManager overrides data for dynamic menu items, After a long debugging session  I finally found what is causing the new macro recorder to get really confused The new macro recorder player tries to avoid the fragility of low level events by tracking higher  semantic  events like selections  It works great with static menu items  However  dynamic menu items suffer from the following problem Most dynamic submenus follow the same pattern ie  they contribute a custom contribution item that creates actions on the fly  then calls each action contribution item to fill in the provided menu When initially created  menu items correctly get the ActionContributionItem set as data  MenuItem setData   However  the following code in MenuManager  line 605             int start   menu getItemCount              src fill menu  destIx             int newItems   menu getItemCount     start            for  int i   0  i  lt  newItems  i                    MenuItem item   menu getItem destIx                   item setData src              I debugged the code above and it seems that it replaces data for each dynamically build action menu item with the data for the parent contribution item  For example  all the menu items for the  Open Perspective  menu have the same data  ChangeToPerspectiveMenu   This makes it impossible to get to the unique perspective Id and reliably reach the same menu item during playback  The same story repeats for other dynamic menus  Show View  New    etc   Is this behaviour intended or just a bug  It seems counter intuitive to me th ,5
