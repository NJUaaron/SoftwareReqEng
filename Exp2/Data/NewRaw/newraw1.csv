240394,workspace file locking and other issues with JSF tag introspection, We are using WTP 3 0 in an adopter product and have discovered major problems with the introspection code for JSF tags   The main issue is file locking of all jars in  WEB INF lib  which prevents refactoring or deletion of the project s  for the entire workbench session   This appears to be an issue with the way JEM is being used to instantiate classes from inside project jars which results in unclosed file handles until the Eclipse JVM process is terminated Furthermore  after classes are loaded  and the jars therefore locked  there are a substantial number of uncaught exceptions appearing in the error log regarding missing fields methods and also problems instantiating component classes in some cases Steps to reproduce  Create a new dynamic web project with the JSF facet  either 1 1 or 1 2  Add any JSF jar file to  WEB INF lib in this project   I used the MyFaces Tomahawk library jar to demonstrate these problems  Open the Tag Registry view Open up the tree in this view and find the taglib URI of the library just added  ex      Now open the node for that taglib URI and introspecting kicks inFirst  the locking issue   This is a trace of the file access that touched the tomahawk jar     sun misc URLClassPath JarLoader access 700 URLClassPath java 646     sun misc URLClassPath

490063, DS  Generate Provide Capability header for declarative services, Equinox supports capabilities and we could therefore add the generation of capability headers aswell 1  Provide CapabilityIf a service is provided  the Provide Capability header should be added  In  this is also discussed for Equinox services  If I understand correctly  adding the header should not have any impact if the header is not supported  e g  by older Equinox implementations  and only adds information th For a service org eclipse MyService  the header would look like this  Provide Capability  osgi service objectClass List lt String gt   org eclipse MyService  2  Require CapabilityIf a bundle provides a DS  it should specify the requirement for DS  Since Neon Equinox adds the corresponding Provide Capability header in the Manifest  We could therefore add the corresponding Require Capability header  which would look like this  Require Capability  osgi extender filter     amp  osgi extender osgi component  version gt  1 2    version gt  2 0    But there are two downsides with adding the Require Capability header a  The service won t work with an older Equinox version  because the Provide Capability header is added with Neon and not available in prior versions b  p2 does not support OSGi capabilities  It has its own capability mechanism th So if we decide to add that  we should make it configurable  ,3

82621, ViewMgmt   RCP  Support for passing input data to views, Some views may need to work with data that customizes its runtime behavior  let s call these configurable or parameterized views  A good example is a configurable view th This view s configuration  data  may include parameters that specify what applet to display  where to find the applet s JAR files  as well as various other applet configuration information  Configurable views may be useful without a configuration  but in a limited capacity  That is  a configurable view may use reasonable defaults for its parameters if a configuration is not found  however  the effectiveness of the unconfigured view is dependent on the function the view provides  For example  a configurable applet view would not be very useful unless a configuration is found that specifies what applet to display  but a configurable web browser view that allows for its decorations  home page  favorites  etc  to be configured may be of some use  e g  browsing the internet  Eclipse 3 0 provides support for multiple instances of a view to be created and displayed within the same workbench page  All views have a unique identifier th Multiple instances of the same view are differentiated using a secondary ID  Multi views can serve as the basis for configurable views  however  they don t provide a mechanism of associating a configuration with a multi view instance A solution to this problem should consider the following  1  The configuration should be available prior to the createPartControl   method being called  2  Views should be able to access their configuration if it was added to a perspective with the org eclipse ui IPageLayout interface or programmatically launched with the org eclipse ui IWorkbenchPage showView String String int  method  3  The Object type of the configuration should be narrow  That is  the configuration should not be of type Object  The Object type is too general and not conducive to creating a generic system for creating and setting view configurations  One possible option is an IConfiguration interface that contains IConfigurationItem Objects  Each IConfigurationItem has a String name and 0 or more String values and optional child IConfigurationItems A couple of solutions to this problem are obvious and are as follows  1  For each method in the org eclipse ui IPageLayout interface that allows for a view to be added to a perspective create an overloaded method with the same signature but with the addition of the view s secondary ID  This will allow for the perspective creator to differentiate this view from other instances in that page  currently the secondary ID is null if added through IPageLayout   In addition  provide a repository where view configurations can be stored  This repository would use the combination of a view s unique identifier and secondary identifier to store a configuration  Configurations should be added to the repository before views are launched and a protected method could be added to the org eclipse ui part ViewPart class that allows for a View to easily obtain it s configuration This solution meets all of the above requirements with a minimum amount of changes to Eclipse 3 0 1 source  I ve implemented it   Shortcomings include that the configuration must be created and set prior to the view being created and there is no way to change the configuration after it s been set  unless you add a listener interface  2  Add a method to the org eclipse ui IViewPart interface to set the configuration  e g  setConfiguration  lt some type   or use the existing setInitializationData   method  This would require larger changes to the Eclipse code base  Much like solution  1  this would require additional methods to be added to the IPageLayout interface but instead of adding a String parameter for the view s secondary identifier it would be the configuration Object  and maybe the secondary identifier too   In addition  a way of obtaining a reference to the ViewPart prior to it s createPartControl   method being called would have to be added if launching a view programatically  e g  IWorkbenchPage showView    This solution can satisfy all of the above requirements but would require more code changes than the first solution especially when launching a view programmatically  ,3

444733,Hide property pages of unused builders and project types, An example When working with an autotools project  project properties still offer the user access to all settings of the CDT managed builder  MBS   Its settings for compiler switches  include paths and so on Settings made there will have no effect  of cause  because the build is completely controlled by autotools Other project models   build systems like CMake and QMake have the same problem  They have to add their own property pages for their settings  but cannot hide other CDT settings they replace  I is very confusing for the user  the GUI gets overloaded with irrelevant entries and its hard to find the wright place to enter a setting I suggest introducing an easy way for plugins to disable some property pages Maybe  a new additional project nature for managed builder projects is necessary  Then MBS  settings visibility would depend on this additional nature instead of  c cc nature  I guess plugins like autotools cannot remove  c cc nature from their projects without loosing the indexer  ,3

510592,Do not lock workspace during fetch operation in a pull operation, Currently EGit holds a workspace lock during the complete pull operation  Suggestion is to avoid this during the fetch Detailed information from Matthias Sohn                                     EGit s PullOperation calls JGit s PullCommand  Pull consists of a fetch command followedby a merge or rebase command  Typically fetch takes much longer than merge or rebaseso instead of pessimistically locking the affected projects for the complete runtime of a pull commandwe could run fetch without any scheduling rule  fetch doesn t modify files in the workspace but onlydownloads new git objects  then acquire the lock on the affected projects and if this succeeds run the merge or rebase command  If we can t get the lock we would need to fail the lock and askthe user to retry later  This could be implemented in EGit by running JGit FetchCommand followedby a MergeCommand or RebaseCommand  Alternatively we could enhance JGit s PullCommandwith a callback enabling EGit to acquire the lock after fetch finished and before merge rebase is started                                      ,3

44156, Commands  parameters  provide M x like command interface, I believe Eclipse usability could be enhanced by providing aninterface similar to Emacs  M x  or Alt x  name of command gesture What I mean It was suggested that I might find the fix to another bug by movingfrom 3 0 M3 to 3 0 M3 I20030930  so I moved  While coding Java  Iwanted to open a class which I knew by name  so I did C S t to get theOpen Type dialog  as I had for many versions  including 3 0 M3  C S tdid nothing  So I went to prefs gt Workbench gt Keys to try to track itdown   Note that this particular task would be easier to accomplish ifone could print the keybindingsbut th  I spent awhile scrolling through thelists but failed to find it  no doubt I did not choose the appropriatecategory In Emacs  one can invoke a command directly  M x name of command   aswell as by keybinding  This is useful  because often the name of thecommand  which can be tab completed in the minibuffer  is moremnemonic than the keybinding Why not provide similar functionality in Eclipse  M x could bring up asimple text dialog into which the user could enter a command  Thenames of the command could be the same as those currently exposed inthe Workbench gt Keys preference page This would also be a useful interface for user defined commands     ,5

117165, Viewers   DeferredContentProvider doesn t update UI for changed elements, I first saw this bug in 3 1 1  but it appears in 3 2 and the latest build Ichecked is 3 2 I20051116 1332 It s an issue with supplying the TableViewer with a DeferredContentProvider When elements of the model are changed  that is  IConcurrentModelListener updateis invoked to notify the provider of the changes   the Table is not updatedunless the results of the sort changes the order of the rows   What it comes down to is that when the SetModel changeAll method is invoked  theUI doesn t get updated some of the time   There appears to be an issue with the ConcurrentTableUpdator class where itdoesn t flush its pending clears unless it s told the element assigned to a rowis different  replace    or checkVisibleRange   is invoked   TheConcurrentTableUpdator scheduleUIUpdate method should be invoked when clears arepending regardless of whether element to tablerow assignments change To reproduce the problem  construct a java project from the testcase attached updatorproblem    After launching the application  you should see a table withsome content and some controls beside the table   select the first row in the table  should be  22   Jitter    click the  Change to  gt   button which changes the integer value of the elementassociated with the first row   The table is not updated with the new integervalue    The table is sorted by the Text column so the sort order won t change    click the  Change to  gt   button again   In eclipse 3 1 1  the table remainsunchanged  but in eclipse 3 2   the table is now updated with the previousinteger value  0    I believe that this is because the  Change to  gt   buttoninvokes a getSelection   which triggers the pending clear from the previousupdate to be flushed to the table   As you click the button successively  thetable will update but it is always behind a step The best workaround I ve thought of so far is to use my own versions ofBackgroundContentProvider and ConcurrentTableUpdator   I added a method toConcurrentTableUpdator that schedules the ui update when there are pendingclears and then I invoke that from BackgroundContentProvider doSort after theConcurrentTableUpdator replace invocations  that way  the method I added doesnothing if the replace   invocations flushed the pending clears    I ll attachmy workarounds for your reference  ,5

105603, IDE  Adding folder to workspace with File  gt  New  gt  Project is counter intuitive inconsistent, There are two ways to add an existing project to the workspace   File  gt  New  gt Project and Import  gt  Existing project into workspace   but only one way to addan existing folder to the workspace as a project   File  gt  New  gt  Project While this makes perfect sense to the implementation  it is counter intuitive tothe user who just wants to work on some existing files in Eclipse that the usershould  create  a project to do it  The behavior is a bit unlike any othercreation wizard in that it does not refuse to create a resource if it alreadyexists  Moreover  it seems a bit odd to the same user that Import does not work since the folder represents a  project  to the user  Import is an odd choice ofnames for this operation  odd enough that the dialog must inform the user thatthe project will not actually be copied into the workspace  The Import pathprovides no way to give an existing project a different name in the workspace Finally  using Edit  gt  Delete to remove a project from the workspace is verycounter intuitive  and kinda scary The differences between New and Import could be resolved by extending the Importwizard to deal with the folder not a project case by treating it the same  i e  converting the folder to a project if need be and adding the option to give theproject another name in the workspace Alternatively  the whole business of adding removing projects could  and I thinkshould  be extracted from New and Import and become independent menu items e g   Add Project and Remove Project  Add project would work like thealready existing folder case does in New  Remove Project would work like Edit  gt Delete for projects  The  delete  functionality could be removed from Edit  gt Delete  Instead  a dialog could advise the user to use Remove Project  ,5

156334, Import Export  Proposal for some changes in WizardExportResourcesPage, I think the class WizardExportResourcesPage would be more useful ifsubclasses could filter the elements shown in the tree and in the list Currently this class shows even hidden folders something that in my opinionmost of the times should not be presented to the user I propose something like this In WizardExportResourcesPage createResourcesGroup Composite parent      this resourceGroup   new ResourceTreeAndListGroup parent  input         getResourceProvider getTreeResourceFilter    WorkbenchLabelProvider getDecoratingWorkbenchLabelProvider   getResourceProvider getListResourceFilter     WorkbenchLabelProvider getDecoratingWorkbenchLabelProvider    SWT NONE DialogUtil inRegularFontMode parent      protected ITreeContentProvider getResourceProvider final IResourceFilterfilter      for  int i   0  i  lt  members length  i             if filter isSelectable members i                    results add members i                protected IResourceFilter getTreeResourceFilter       protected IResourceFilter getListResourceFilter        public interface IResourceFilter         boolean isSelectable IResource resource    ,5
