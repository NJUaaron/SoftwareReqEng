547648,Java  build automatically  isn t always  immediately , Version  2019 06 M2  4 12 0M2 Build id  20190509 1623Eclipse Enterprise packageI have Project  gt  Build Immediately on as I have for years I ll usually start up Eclipse and let it sit for a minute or two to make sure it has loaded everything and indexed everything and brought everything up to date so thNow in version 2019 06 M2 after Eclipse calms down  when I touch it suddenly it springs to life and makes me wait again  For example  maybe I ll just click on an open file  Or maybe I ll click on a project in Project Explorer It especially happens if I click on a project and hit  Ctrl Shift 3  to commit changes to the Git repository  Suddenly Eclipse tells me to wait because other things are going on  and it initializes tooling  it checks the file system for changes  and then decides it wants to rebuild half my projects  which can take even a minute or more   when I only asked it to commit files to SCM  which has nothing to do with compiling  Oddly the projects were compiled and up to date when I last closed down Eclipse  so why is it rebuilding them If it needed to rebuild projects  why didn t it do that when it started up  instead of waiting until I needed to do some action completely unrelated to building  And if  build automatically  was on when I last had Eclipse open  and no changes were made to the file system after Eclipse was shut down  why is Eclipse trying to build things again I really don t remember Eclipse behaving like this pre 2019 06  but maybe I m just now noticing this  ,3

546120,editing lambda in interface default method froze IDE,  breaks renaming in later versions  and 2019 06 M1  which supposedly will fix this problem  hasn t been released yet  I have something like

red check in the margin said something about being unable to find the  this  variable So I thought maybe Java doesn t support method references using  this  in interfaces  and I changed it from   or this  findName   to   or     gt findName     Suddenly Eclipse froze  The screen was covered with an overlay and I got the turning circle icon  I had to kill the process  After restarting Eclipse  I was able to use   or this  findName   with no problem  No errors were in the log from around this time But as I was moving the code around to try to reproduce this  I got another series of errors

525289,Breakpoints sometimes invisible, screenshotSometimes  when you step into code and then place breakpoints there  the breakpoints are  invisible  in the editor left margin What I means is 1  The breakpoints are effectively created and functional  they are shown in the breakpoints view  and they also make execution stop when th2  But there is no indication of any breakpoints shown in the editor margin on the left  where breakpoint markers would normally be shown I don t know exactly a logic to reproduce it  but after running into frustrating bug a bunch of times finally decided to make a bug report even though I don t have an exact  how to reproduce  recipe I think this probably has something to do with whether or not the source file in which we are placing breakpoint is on the classpath of the a project  But I m not entirely sure of that See attached screenshot which shows that   there are several breakpoints shown in the breakpoint view   there are  no  breakpoints shown in the editor which is opened on the corresponding source Other potentially relevant info that may help reproduce   The breakpoints that are shown in breakpoint view were created by clicking in the editor margin in the way you usually create breakpoints  but this only made the breakpoints appear in the BP view  not the editor used to create them   The editor was not opened by clicking any file in the workspace but was opened as a result of clicking in the stack of the debugger view after hitting a BP in much deeper stackframe  The source code displayed is from a source bundle installed in the target platform  ,3

211945,JNDI CP sets authZ identity incorrectly when authN type is AuthNSelfIssuedMaterials, When JNDIContext open is called and an AuthNSelfIssuedMaterials is passed  the provider authenticates to the underlying JNDI SP using whatever Context SECURITY PRINCIPAL and Context SECURITY CREDENTIALS were set in the context s configuration  Using this identity  it searches for a subject matching the data found in the AuthNSelfIssuedMaterials   This works in terms of authentication  but the underlying JNDI context is left open using the original principal and credentials This causes a scenario where anyone authenticating with AuthNSelfIssuedMaterials gets the authZ privileges of another identity   This could cause more or less data to be returned than is allowed from subsequent access operations  ,3

122266, key binding  Provide key bindings for text editing commands, I m trying to inherit keybinding assignments from the default text scope  These commands are defined  but they are not mapped to the ARROW keys  This is strange  since the arrow keys do in fact invoke these actions in the default text editor I am writing a custom widget and would like to use actions handlers for all  actions   It seems like the text editor is relying on the widgets default handling of these keystrokes  ,3

438787,Wrong ResourceFactoryDescriptor selected by J2EEModelProvider, Through org eclipse jst j2ee J2EEModelProvider extension point an extender can declare a J2EEModelProviderFactoryClass and can limit the use of this factory to a given number of facet versions  besides  the extender can use the extension point org eclipse wst common modulecore resourceFactories to declare a ResourceFactoryDescriptor for a given content type  this ResourceFactoryDescrptor is then used by the J2EEModelProvider to create the model of a project  this last is not attached to a version and for such a wrong ResourceFactoryDescrptor could be used in the right J2EEModelProvider to create the model of a project As example  An extender defines ResourceFactoryDescriptor named ApplicationResourceFactory for the ApplicationClient content type either 5 or 6  then it defines J2EEModelProvider for jst appclient versions 5 0 and 6 0  Since WTP already supports facet 7 0  when an application client project is imported with facet 7 0  the J2EEModelProvider by the extender is not used because it doesn t match with the facet version  so the org eclipse jst jee model internal AppClient5ModelProvider is used instead  Later this model provider uses the ApplicationResourceFactory provided by the extender to create the model of the project  ,3

475353,Provide an Equinox based launcher application, Generating code on a server as part of the CI is a common practice these days For such situations Acceleo provides the Acceleo Maven plugin  but it can be hard to setup for the following reasons    the generator  and all its dependencies  should be working in standalone    which can prove to be difficult or impossible if   this requires explict registration of EPackages and Resource factories  technical details which uses are not necessarly aware of as this is done automatically in an OSGi Equinox context  the generator has to be published itself in a Maven repositoryall these factors are especially relevant for our core user base which is fairly used to the Eclipse technologies  will generally distribute their generators alongside other tooling through p2 update sites Since version 0 14  Tycho  which integrates Maven and Eclipse based technologies  provide a generic way to launch any Equinox application through the tycho eclipserun plugin   Here is an example use for launching the b3 aggregator application  Tycho eclipserun allow the definition of extra dependencies retrieved through p2  From a runtime point of view  the application is launched in an equinox runtime and as such every  auto wiring  of the EPackages and Resource factories would work out of the box This ticket is about investigating and developping a headless equinox application to launch Acceleo generators  It would allow to easily setup a code generation for a given project by referencing the generator update site  add the generator as a dependency and set the application arguments to launch the generation right from the corresponding pom xml ,3

79178,Re visit the order of context menu entries, In some context menus  the order of the menu items is unusual  At least for me  this causes always brief moments of irritation  especially when alternating between CDT and other IDEs  JDT       For instance  if I right click a C project in the Resource Navigator  the items  Create Make Target  and  Build Make Target  appear as the last entries  after the  Properties   Usually one expects the  Properties  item to be the last in the list The same applies to editor context menus in the C editor  In JDT  the navigation section   Open Declaration       is above the standard edit entries   Copy        In general  the order of items should be the same in all Eclipse IDE projects  which is also in accord with the UI guidelines   ,3

466658, launchbar  Provide extension point to exclude specific launch config types, There do exist some launch configurations which by necessity need to be public  but which adopters may feel do not belong in the launchbar specifically  Our usecase is th If the server object  and its launch config  already had in it stored the details of the remote machine  it would either appear as Run      Tomc5       On     Localhost     which would be wrong  since the launch config already contains information about how to launch it on a remote box     or    Run      Tomc Either way  it d be very useful to be able to exclude specific launch config types from being present in the launchbar  ,3
467153, launchbar  ILaunchConfigurationProvider API is insufficient  needs access to target, I have previously noted th I find this argument compelling  for many reasons  1  Not all providers are persisting their launch configs  Some are creating throwaway private launch configs on the fly and need access to the target to properly configure  2  Some o e remote objects may represent other larger models  For example  our usecase is one o e remote type which represents  all  org eclipse wst server servertypes  The launch configuration we return may not even share the same launchconfig type id  and so access to the remote target is required even if all we want to do is check it for details to see wh 3  The suggested API to gain access to the debug target in the launchconfig itself is not thread safe   see    and most likely cannot be  4  Not all launch configs will be shared  5  Clients may still desire to persist data in these shareable launch configs  even if it violates best practices  because their company s workflow has standardized some of this data on all dev boxes specifically to solve the sharing problem  such as names of specific connection   server names   port numbers   etc For me  item 2  is the most compelling reasons  Simply knowing an o e remote connection is  ssh  or  mycustomRemoteType  is not enough  I need access to the remote object to know its underlying details so th Item 3  has proven that it is not safe to do this in the launch itselfItems 1  4  and 5 all point to an API restricting wh ,3

535685, Migration  Unify Template Model and View Model Migration, The template model and view model migration should be refactored to use common functionality from common migration bundles Currently  the view model and the template model migration are completely separated from each other  Additionally  the template model migration is only based on string substitution  Furthermore  classes like TemplateModelMigrationUtil or TemlateModelWorkspaceMigrator are part of the view migrator bundle   gt  The migration should be refactored to have a common Edapt based migrator and  if necessary  subclasses with specific details for view and template models  The basic Edapt migrator should be located in a common migration bundle  For this  most functionality should also be present in the EdaptViewModelMigrator Currently  the logic for checking for migrating files in the workspace is duplicated between the view and the template editor  except forsearching for model files  this is in WorkspaceUtil in the ide util bundle    gt  The workspace migration should be centralized in a common workspace migration bundle and check for all  EMF Forms  models  currently viewand template   This includes the dialogs prompted to the user as well as executing the migration  ,3

388770,Provide a lazy adapting ChangeRecorder, Provide a ChangeRecorder th   A org eclipse emf ecore change util ChangeRecorder cannot be used together with partly loaded CDO models since the self adapting mechanism follows all references recursively until the whole containment graph has been loaded into memory CDO provides a CDOLazyContentAdapter thIt would be favourable if the proposed  lazy  ChangeRecorder was compatible with the existing org eclipse emf ecore change util ChangeRecorder and so also with ChangeCommand  But ChangeCommand  ChangeRecorder and its adaption mechanism are currently  soldered  together in a way thIdeas   Make org eclipse emf ecore change util ChangeRecorder delegate the object adaption to a pluggable adapter  let it default to current behaviour   In this way a CDOLazyContentAdapter can be used when needed and all related EMF functionality can be reused by CDO models   IF the org eclipse emf common notify Adapter interface doesn t provide enough functionality for the ChangeRecorder  maybe a new interface with the functionality needed by a pluggable adapter can be introduced and then be implemented by CDOLazyContentAdapter There may be similarities with this bug   ,3

397384,Nullpointer Exception in AbstractDiscoverKDMSourceAndJavaModel, Patch with recommended bug fix     EnvironmentEclipse Modelling Package SR1MoDisco installed from Juno Update Site v10 1Discover Java and inventory model from java project    Problem DescriptionThe java project of a legacy application discovered contains an empty java file The Eclipse IDE does not report this as an error and the application builds successfully However  the java and inventory discoverer fails due to a nullpointer exception and the error logging does not provide enought information to find the source of this error in a reasonable way The stack trace is provided The reason for the NullpointerException is thIn case of an empty compilation unit  getPackageFromCU   returns null  The following call to getJava2DirectoryFromPackage pck  also returns null  Finally  the method manageJava2DirectoryCreation compilationUnit pck  is invoked with a null package  too As a reuslt  this method creates a Java2Directory element with a null package which later on leads to the null pointer exception as shown in the stack trace     Recommended solutionWhile empty java files should not exist  it might happen in legacy applications which should be modernized  Furthermore  a package might not exist for a compilation unit because of other reasons  MoDisco should be robust against such issues which could be reached with the recommendations described below and attached as a patch to this bug report Inside getJava2DirectoryFromPackage    there is already a warning logged about the missing package elementMoDiscoLogger logWarning  No Package Found   Activator getDefault        NON NLS 1 However  this logging provides not enough information for a user to understand the reason and fix the issue in his project To make the processing more robust The method manageJava2DirectoryCreation compilationUnit pck  should return null if a null pck was submitted  When it returns null  the compilationUnit loop in weaveCompilationUnit   should continue with the next iteration I tested inserting the following lines from line 454 on    skip further processing if the package is null because it would make no senseif java2Directory    null    java2Directory getJavaPackage      null  MoDiscoLogger logWarning  No Package Found for Java2Directory    java2Directory  Activator getDefault        NON NLS 1 continue  Add the following lines at the begining of method manageJava2DirectoryCreation      check for null packageif pck    null  return null  And extended the package check inside getJava2DirectoryFromPackage   if    Java2Directory  object  getJavaPackage      null      Java2Directory  object  getJavaPackage   equals pck        Error Message and StackTrace  ENTRY org eclipse core jobs 4 2 2013 01 03 15 25 05 185 MESSAGE An internal error occurred during   MoDisco discoverer  org eclipse modisco java composition discoverer fromProject  in progress      STACK 0java lang NullPointerExceptionjava 514 java 447 java 224 java 89 java 93 java 183 java 229 java 168 java 53  ,5

97780, Model  Make BaseWorkbenchContentProvider and LabelProvider adapter manager friendly, I m sorry I missed this way back in M5  but I just realized that I hadn tsubmitted patches to enable the Workbench s default content and label providersto use the adapter factory  Actually  the example we are using in the RCP bookshows how to use adapters and was reminded thI ve attached a patch that you can apply against v20050526 1200 that fixed boththese classes and allows you to put objects into viewers that  don t  have toimplement IAdaptable directly  instead you can register an adapter for them This is very useful when you are adding objects into a viewer from a 3rd partylibrary and you can t change their code  See  for more discussionsabout other places in the Workbench that have been changed to do this same kindof check  I actually submitted the patch for this a long time ago and justforgot about this case  So why do I think this should be put into 3 1  Well  for starters it s reallypart of the improved action contribution plan item and was just plain forgotten It s a low risk fix because the IAdaptable check is still done in the sameorder  which in case of existing viewers would mean that this is the code thatwill still run  If the object is not adaptable  then the adapter manager ischecked  There is a small performance hit if the objects don t adapt toIAdaptable but since this was enforced  it won t affect any existing plug ins  The only contraversal issue in the patch is thloadAdapter  is called instead of getAdapter    This is for the same reason as stated in Bug86362 ,5

109213, JFace   Undo    generic navigation undo in JFace viewers, While looking at the different kinds of undo that might be useful in the IDE  there is a category of  mouse accidents  or  wrong key slipups  that could be undone if JFace viewers provided generic undo for navigation operations Examples include   changes in selection  expand collapse state in trees  visible item  scrolling While these kinds of problems aren t as important as data loss  there are times that one wrong move can invalidate a lot of effort that went into getting where you wanted to be This kind of support could perhaps be available in some place other than Edit gt Undo     probably some kind of affordance on the part itself Thoughts  ,5

180579, Undo    Consider removing redundant resource descendants before creating an undoable operation,  for background This is something to be considered in the future Currently  users can select redundant overlapped resources when deleting resources   For example  consider a project with this folder structure f1 f2 f3 f4select f1  f2  and f4   Delete The user is prompted  are you sure you want to delete these 3 resources  User says yes  and f1 and all its descendants are deleted   This delete can be undone and redone successfully because the fix for  strips f2 and f4 out of the list of deleted resources in the operation However  it might be nicer in the long run if these were stripped before the user is prompted  so th ,5
